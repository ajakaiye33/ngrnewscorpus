          "title": "Without Buhari, Nigeria would have been like Venezuela \u2014Ngige",
          "text": "Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, Wednesday described leadership as very critical to the survival of any human society, saying without President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been like Venezuela.\n\nNgige said Nigeria was passing through hard times, not because of the current government, but as a result of poor planning over the years.\n\nDeputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, in a statement said the minister spoke in his office after his induction as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Corporate Governance, INSLEC, a leading global professional body of both present and aspiring leaders, entrepreneurs and people in corporate governance.\n\nThis came as the President/Chairman of the council, Professor Gabriel Emecheta, said the decision to elect Ngige as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the INSLEC speaks volumes about his pristine and differentiated worth as a leader, mentor and bridge builder.\n\nAccording to Ngige \u201cA good leader must be an implementation man. He should be knowledgeable, because after the vision, he will dissect and crystalise them. He should be a jack of all trade and master of all. He may not score distinction in all but should be able to score distinction in many.\n\n\u201cHe must also be courageous to implement hard decisions. If you don\u2019t implement courageously, some of the visions will die or will not be implemented for the good of all. He must also be compassionate, knowing when to tamper justice with mercy, to show the human part of him. He should exude milk of human kindness.\n\n\u201cI know that our country is passing through a very rough time now because we have not planned well. It is not this administration. We know we were all dependent on oil. So, when oil prices came crashing and when security issues arose, disrupting production, we were caught napping. Because of that we went into recession. Later on, COVID-19 forced us to go into a second recession. We are not yet out of the woods.\n\n\u201cWe thank God. I am part of this government. I know that if we don\u2019t have the kind of leader that we have who is strong like President Muhammadu Bihari, the experience of Nigeria would have been like that of Venezuela.\n\nThe citizens of Nigeria would have spilled into the Cameroons, Niger and other places as refugees. We were looking forward to it. But he forced us all to go into agriculture. We made agriculture the first signature programme of the administration and provided food security so that we can eat whatever we grow here.\u201d\n\nNgige noted that Nigeria has stopped the importation of rice, sorghum, millet, tomatoes and other things hitherto imported, all of which were dependent on the scarce foreign exchange.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s GDP grew by 5.01 percent in fourth quarter 2021, the highest in the last seven years, marking three consecutive quarters of growth, following the negative growths recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u201cServices provided the lead, followed by agriculture, even though it had a deep and then, followed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\n\u201cSo, we have to be grateful to the Government and our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, for standing firm that we will import food anymore here. Even if he didn\u2019t stand firm, we didn\u2019t have the money anymore to start importing potatoes, tooth pick, chocolate and others.\u201d\n\nNgige dedicated the fellowship to the ordinary Nigerians, saying that he believes in the have-nots and would continue to fight for them wherever he found himself.\n\nHe thanked the institute and chairman of the governing board for the fellowship and pledged to be a good member, not only in terms of participation, but also loyalty and obedience to the institute.\n\nEarlier, Professor Ayandiji Aina, the Chairman, Planning and Resource Committee extolled Ngige\u2019s creativity, confidence, decisiveness, humility and trustworthiness, describing him as a conflict manager of great distinction.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It\u2019s a failure to the point that it is ruling Nigeria with tension. Ordinarily to sign the Electoral Act, they keep on postponing it everyday and Nigerians are tired.\n\n\u201cA party that cannot hold a national convention is it a party that can rule Nigeria? Ordinary convention, a party in power cannot hold one. Look at how we did our own. That is to tell you that PDP is the party that should rule Nigeria. This is the party that will rule Imo State too.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: How get-rich-quick syndrome is fueling ritual killings \u2014 Stakeholders\n\nWike enjoined members of the PDP in Imo State not to succumb to any form of intimidation against them by any party, adding that days of such intimidation are gone.He emphasised that one of the reasons for attending the reception was to tell them of the need for PDP to strategise and reclaim the governorship of Imo State because the sitting governor has failed already.\n\nWike said: \u201cThe only mistake that we will make to allow the man to come back is for us not to work together, and we will not make that mistake. \u201cNow, all of us must unite. If there is no party, there will be no governor. If there is no party, there will be no president.\n\n\u201cLet nobody fear, nobody can intimidate us. Can you be intimidated? All that time has passed when somebody that carried fourth will come first. It will never happen again.\n\n\u201cBut if you want us to take back Imo State in the next election, all of us must work together. We are ready to support you to take back Imo State.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman, Board of Trustees, BOT, of the party, Senator Walid Jubril, acknowledged the huge work done by the leaders of the party to ensure it waxes stronger.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The cases were dismissed.\n\nMany stakeholders have lauded Governor AbdulRasak for conducting a free, fair and transparent exercise.\n\nBefore the commencement of the poll, he allowed the aspirants to crosscheck the party membership register to allay any fear of exclusion of their supporters from the register and from voting.\n\nThe voting, sorting, counting and poll announcement was also transparent.\n\nCivil society groups who monitored the exercise urged other parties and states to learn from the Osun experience.\n\nBut Adeoti prayed the court for a declaration that he was the validly nominated candidate.\n\nAdeoti further prayed the court to declare that Oyetola was not qualified to contest under the party\u2019s constitution, because he is an officer of the party.\n\nHe also sought, among others, an order directing the APC to forward his name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the validly nominated candidate, rather than Oyetola.\n\nAdeoti, the plaintiff, made the prayers in his originating summons in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/203 filed through his counsel, Chiesonu Okpoko, SAN.\n\nThe APC, Oyetola and INEC, who are the 1st to 3rd defendants respectively, are yet to file a reply.\n\nOyetola swept all the 30 Local Government Areas (LGA) and Ife-East Area Office in the primary.\n\nIn his suit, Adeoti raised seven questions for determination, to challenge Oyetola\u2019s victory.\n\nHe contended, among others, that Oyetola was by virtue of his appointment by the APC\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) as a member of the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary and Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), was an officer of the party.\n\nAccording to him, Oyetola ought to have resigned his membership of the CECPC and leave office as an officer of the party at least 30 days prior to the date of the primary to qualify for participation in the primary.\n\nHe argued that this \u201crefusal and/or neglect to resign his membership of the CECPC, disqualified him as a candidate in the primary.\n\nThe plaintiff prayed the court for 12 reliefs, including \u201cA declaration that by virtue of Article 2 of the 1st Defendant\u2019s Constitution (October 2014 as Amended), the decisions of the CECPC or any of its organs or any committee set up by it, cannot override the provisions of the 1st Defendant\u2019s Constitution.\n\n\u201cA declaration that by the combined effect of section 222 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as Amended) and Article 31 (1li) of the 1st Defendant\u2019s (October 2014 as Amended), the 2nd Defendant ought to have resigned his membership of the CECPC and leave office as an officer of the 1st Defendant at least 30 days prior to the date of the 1st Defendant\u2019s Osun State primary election to qualify for participation in the sald 1st Defendant\u2019s primary election.\u201d\n\nA declaration that by virtue of the Oyetola\u2019s failure to resign or leave his office as a member of the CECPC at least 30 days before the Primary he was \u201cdisqualified from contesting in the said primary election of 19th February, 2022.\n\nHe further sought a declaration that Oyetola having participated in the primary \u201cis a grave violation or breach of the principle of audi alterem partem and Nemo judex in causa sua\u201d\n\nOther reliefs are \u201ca declaration that the 2nd Defendant is disqualified from contesting as an aspirant in the 1st Defendant\u2019s Osun State Governorship primary of 19th February, 2022 in Osun State.\n\n\u201cA declaration that all the votes cast in favour of the 2nd Defendant in the 1st Defendant\u2019s Osun State Governorship Primary of 19th February, 2022 are invalid and/or throw away votes and/or wasted votes., the 2nd Defendant being unqualified to contest in the said Primaries.\n\n\u201cAn order restraining the 1st Defendant from sending the name of the 2nd Defendant to the 3rd Defendant as a candidate in the 1st Defendant\u2019s Governorship primary of 19th February, 2022 in Osun State.\n\n\u201cAn order restraining the 1st and 3rd Defendants from recognizing the 2nd Defendant as the winner of 1st Defendant\u2019s Governorship primary of 19th February, 2022 in Osun State.\n\n\u201cAn order declaring the PLAINTIFF as the validly nominated candidate of the 1st Defendant having polled the highest number of lawful votes cast in the 1st Defendant\u2019s Osun State Governorship Primary of 19th February, 2022.\n\n\u201cAn order directing the 1st Defendant to forward the name of the PLAINTIFF to the 3rd Defendant as the validly nominated candidate of the I\u201d Defendant having polled the highest number of lawful votes cast in the I* Defendant\u2019s Osun State Governorship Primary of 19th February, 2022",

          "title": "Rising Oil Prices Worry FG, Says Nigeria Not Gaining from Soaring Rates",
          "text": "\u2022Sylva: Nigeria\u2019s comfort zone is $70-$80\n\n\u2022Fuel scarcity: NNPC distributes 387.5m litres of petrol in one week\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed concern over the rising international prices of crude oil, saying the increase is not good for the country.\n\nThe government bemoaned waning foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, and reiterated the need to float an African Energy Bank to curb the continent\u2019s dependence on Europe, Asia and America for funding.\n\nAlso, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited yesterday released details of how it distributed a total of 387.59 million litres of petrol in the last one week to bridge the gap caused by the withdrawal of methanol-blended products in circulation.\n\nThis was as the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec premium motor spirit (PMS) grilled other importers and suppliers of the product.\n\nSpeaking on the rising crude oil prices in an interview with Bloomberg Television, monitored by THISDAY, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, maintained that Nigeria\u2019s comfort zone in terms of oil prices was between $70 and $80 per barrel.\n\nAlthough Sylva did not particularly explain why higher oil prices were bad for Nigeria, he stated that at the moment, Nigeria was not gaining anything from the soaring prices.\n\nOn the back of rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, on Tuesday hit $99.03, the highest in the last nine years, almost touching the much-talked-about $100.\n\nClearly, the country\u2019s controversial fuel subsidy regime, which would gulp N3 trillion this year, coupled with its inability to ramp up production to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have combined to limit the gains from the oil price hike.\n\nHowever, Sylva blamed the inability of Nigeria to activate the oil wells it shut down when OPEC instructed producing countries to cut production as well as the lack of investment in the upstream sector for the country\u2019s inability to increase production. At the moment, Nigeria is losing at least 300,000 bpd to its capacity challenges.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful the prices will move around, maybe $80, maybe $70. We are hoping it will come down to somewhere around $70 to $80, which will be sustainable for us to the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard on that (production increase). What happened to us was the fact that we had to cut back at the time, and, of course, in such a way you can\u2019t really cut back mathematically.\n\n\u201cSo, you want to cut back 100,000 barrels that you shut out, maybe we\u2019ll shut down about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels. So at the end of the day, we over-complied because we just couldn\u2019t achieve it mathematically.\n\n\u201cIn trying to cut down, we cut down too much. And now to come back, it\u2019s not been easy for us to get the wells back to production.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that a lot of additional investments would be needed to ramp up production, but lamented that foreign funding was drying out for the industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very easy these days to get the investments in. We really are not able to meet up our quota now. But I believe that we\u2019re working so very hard to ensure that, because we are not happy at all.\n\n\u201cI mean, with the kind of prices we are seeing. We are obviously not happy about it. So we would like to definitely be back on track by later this year. It\u2019s not been very easy to get investments. A lot of people can\u2019t get investments into the sector.\u201d\n\nOn what was being done to change the dire investment situation, Sylva stated that Africa was now beginning to realise that it could not be completely dependent on foreign funding.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo we\u2019re looking at how we can get our African energy bank set up. Also, we\u2019re looking at how we can rally multilateral funding into financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to Afreximbank. We\u2019re working with other African producers to try to rally some funding for our sector in Africa, because we cannot continue to depend on funding that\u2019s not coming.\u201d\n\nThe minister reiterated that the world could not abandon fossil fuels when it had not built capacity to harness the alternative, noting that the decision to withdraw funding was hurting the industry and the countries of the world.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been saying all the time. I mean that we have not been investing in the oil and gas sector for too long. And we expected that this was going to happen at some point, because there will be a gap, because now that gap cannot be filled by renewables.\n\n\u201cAnd that is because you are not also investing that quickly into renewables, you\u2019re not developing renewables that quickly. So now there is a gap. And in addition to this gap, you have all the geopolitical tension.\n\n\u201cWe are saying they must move gradually towards renewables, I mean, because if they take out the investment so quickly from fossil fuels, they cannot develop renewables at that same rate. That is what we are saying.\u201d\n\nSylva further said he was not aware of discussions with the United States for Nigeria to increase supply of gas to Europe on the back of the Russia and Ukraine tensions, explaining that if it has to happen, it would take time and investment. But he explained that in the medium term, the country intended to begin supply to the continent through Algeria and Morocco.\n\nSylva said, \u201cWe are actually having those kinds of conversations with Algeria, we are building a pipeline, the Trans Sahara gas pipeline that is going to take up our gas all the way down to Algeria to Europe.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning a pipeline to take our gas to Morocco. So we are planning two pipelines, one to Algeria, to Europe through Algeria, and one to Europe through Morocco.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re actually planning to take our gas to Europe. But I don\u2019t know of any plan now to take gas to Europe because of the political tensions with Russia.\u201d\n\nOn the Trans Sahara line, he stated that Nigeria had just signed with Algeria and had already started construction from the Nigerian end of the 614 kilometres AKK Pipeline, to take the pipeline all the way to Algeria to the border.\n\nFor the Morocco pipeline, he noted that it was still at the level of studies, with reports being expected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excess capacity, but it will take some time to build the infrastructure and, of course, the LNG, it will also take a while. So, there is no spare capacity that we can immediately off-take to Europe now.\u201d\n\nSylva, who spoke on the current OPEC supplies, stated that there was no need to increase quota at this time beyond the already agreed 400,000 bpd, which the cartel embarked upon last year.\n\nHe stressed that he planned to visit the headquarters of Chevron, ExxonMobil, ENI and the rest of the multinationals operating in Nigeria to get their commitments on additional investments in Nigeria, especially with the advent of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which has made investment more attractive.\n\nFuel Scarcity: NNPC Distributes 387.5m Litres of Petrol in One Week\n\nThe release of the document by NNPC coincided with the gradual easing of the long fuel queues, especially in Abuja, where traffic had been mostly grounded due to the closure of some roads by desperate motorists.\n\nTHISDAY observed that even the NNPC mega station along Olusegun Obasanjo Way, in Abuja, which had hitherto experienced intractable lines of vehicles before now, had lighter queues. At the Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar Way, in Wuse Zone 3, which for weeks did not have the product, motorists had also begun buying PMS.\n\nStill in Abuja, retail outlets in the satellite towns, such as Bwari, Lugbe, Kubwa, Zuba, Kuje, and others, which hitherto witnessed product shortages, were seen dispensing petrol to motorists. The story was the same in some areas in Lagos and other major cities in the country.\n\nNNPC said in a statement that the petrol bought by Nigerians through retail filling stations between February 14 and 20 represented an average daily distribution of 55.4 million litres. The weekly national evacuation report released showed that 80 per cent of all the petrol distribution took place at 20 high-loading depots, while 20 per cent took place at the others.\n\nNNPC listed the top 20 high-loading depots used for distribution as Pinnacle-Lekki, which evacuated the highest volume of 70.8 million litres, and NIPCO, which distributed 22.6 million litres.\n\nAITEO distributed 22.3 million litres; Swift, 16 million litres; 11 Plc, 15.9 million litres; Bovas Bulk, 15 million litres; and Frado 14.6 million litres.\n\nOthers were Keonamex, 13.7 million litres; MRS Ltd, 11.9 million litres; Rainoil 11.6 million litres; AYM Shafa, 11.2 million litres; TSL, 11.2 million litres; Rainoil Lagos, 11.2 million litres; and Matrix, 10 million litres.\n\nAlso on the list were Conoil Lagos, 9.7 million litres; AA Rano, 8.8 million litres; Bluefin, 8.4 million litres; HOGL, 8.2 million litres; Ibafon Calabar, 8 million litres; and Mainland, 7.5 million litres.\n\nWith the distribution of 385.59 million litres in one week, NNPC stated that scarcity of petrol was being arrested, with queues drastically reducing at filling stations in Abuja, Lagos, and other major cities.\n\nAccording to the company, selling outlets that had been shut for over a week due to supply gap opened for operations since last Sunday.\n\nThe methanol-blended product, NNPC had earlier said, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four cargoes under NNPC\u2019s Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.\n\nNNPC had last week promised that over 2.3 billion litres of the product would be delivered before the end of February 2022 to totally arrest the situation.\n\nGroup Executive Director, Downstream, of the national oil company, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, had further assured during a media briefing to announce the 2.3 billion litres expected cargoes, that Nigerians would heave a sigh of relief \u201cin days.\u201d\n\nTo lessen the pain and ensure that the long queues disappeared, Adeyemi stated that along with its partners, NNPC was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians can now buy the product round the clock at filling stations.\n\nFurthermore, the executive director had announced that at the time, the country had over 1 billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe.\n\nMany believe the bad fuel may have been fully withdrawn, as cargoes of clean petrol arrive the country daily to bridge the gap created by the withdrawal of the methanol-blended petrol.\n\nNNPC further noted that a monitoring team had been set up with sister government agencies to ensure a seamless process, urging the security agencies to fully cooperate.\n\nHouse Grills Other Suppliers, as Duke Oil, Oando Absolve Selves of Blame\n\nThe House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec petrol yesterday grilled other importers and suppliers of the off-spec fuel. The two oil companies, Duke Oil and Oando Plc, which were quizzed by the lawmakers, denied culpability in the importation of the bad fuel. Addressing the lawmakers, both companies said their product met the required Nigerian specification.\n\nIn his presentation, Managing Director of Duke Oil, Lawal Sade, said the product his company imported was certified okay both at the port of loading and the port of discharge by the relevant authorities. He said they were notified by NNPC a few hours after the discharge that the product had some particles, which made them to discontinue the process.\n\nSade said the company shared the pains Nigerians went through as a result of the discovery and quarantine of the methanol-blended PMS, adding that Duke Oil has already taken necessary steps to remedy the situation.\n\nHe told the House committee, \u201cMr Chairman, yes, there was a delivery of cargo by Duke Oil, like you have seen in the report, and that cargo met up with the Nigerian spec, as it is both at the loading and discharge ports. There was a confirmation by the regulator, which is the new Nigerian midstream, downstream authority, to discharge that cargo within the stipulated date.\n\n\u201cThe cargo discharged and the vessel sailed. It was just after 24 hours of operation then, that Duke Oil was notified by the NNPC that there was a complaint from some of their customers that the cargo had some particles\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Chairman, with the notification from PPMC/NNPC, immediately, the management of Duke Oil authorised the NNPC not to evacuate the cargo any further and requested for a recertification. But it is important we reiterate the fact that the cargo has been certified by the midstream and then, there is a joint inspection before the discharge and the specification provided in the contract with NNPC meet up the Nigerian specification.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cAnd then, some remedial actions were taken immediately, Mr. Chairman, to conclude the report and give an assurance to this House committee and, indeed, all Nigerians that Duke Oil, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the NNPC and commercially driven company, we are not just in business to make money, but also to guarantee the energy security of our great nation and we never compromise the quality of the product we supply to Nigeria and any other place we do business and we will always seek to maintain this positive position.\u201d\n\nOn its part, Oando Plc representative, Afanga Afanga, also said their product met the Nigerian specification.\n\nAfanga stated, \u201cIn line with our DSSP contract with the NNPC on January 16, 2022, we delivered 90MT worth of PMS on board the Vessel MT Elka Apollon. It is important to note that this PMS cargo that was supplied met and was in line with all the Nigerian and DSDP contractual specifications.\n\n\u201cThis was confirmed by the mandatory tests that were conducted at the loading port in Europe and before discharge in Nigeria by independent NNPC quality inspectors and finally by agents of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority. It is on this basis that the cargo was certified and accepted for discharge by NNPC.\n\n\u201cAs clearly stated by NNPC last week, when they were before this committee, its current inspection protocol does not include testing for methanol content and, thus, was not detected by the NNPC quality inspectors.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing at this juncture for us is to work with NNPC as we are committed to ensuring that what is brought into the country is well treated and the issues around the situation are alleviated for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe have given assurances and we have also been able to show to be following the right protocol and there was nothing that was breached as being alleged.\u201d\n\nResponding, the chairman of the committee, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, asked the companies to submit all relevant documents regarding their presentations, adding that they may be re-invited if necessary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "APC Zoning Presidency to South Puts PDP in Quandary",
          "text": "\u2022Bala Mohammed: Ruling party\u2019s decision constitutes no threat to us\n\nObinna Chima and James Sowole in Abeokura\n\nThe decision, Tuesday, by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country, might have put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a quandary for contemplating to leave its own ticket open and by implication, put the north at advantage.\n\nBut the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, yesterday, reinforced the PDP position, when he declared that the zoning of the presidency to the South by the ruling party posed no threat to the main opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHis reaction may however underscore a concern in the party even though he tried to put a brave face on it.\n\nUnfortunately for the PDP, the APC seems to be playing a rather smarter card, given the current mood of the nation, and especially, because while most of the governors in both parties wanted power to shift to the south of Nigeria, the governors, being life of the political parties, are consciously working to the answer.\n\nAlthough in the PDP, such leaders like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, are among those, who want the PDP ticket thrown open. The Southern PDP governors are also inclined to power shift.\n\nHowever, the possibility that the PDP too might still go South is high, because once the party had zoned its chairmanship to the North, it is only ideal that its presidential ticket is taken South, a situation that would further give the APC an advantage of southern votes.\n\nThis is not to dismiss the understanding alleged to have been reached by PDP leaders at the point of making Dr. Iyorchia Ayu the national chairman of party, that if the equation changed at the point of choosing a presidential candidate, the chairman would resign if interests clashed.\n\nInterestingly, and based on simple logic, many of the PDP governors knew that the APC would have an advantage in the south if the presidency was zoned to the south.\n\nBut the danger in this is that the party could lose the votes of some northern states as THISDAY had previously extrapolated, a development that could automatically put states like Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom in play for the APC that is fielding a Southern candidate.\n\nWhat this means is that with a Southern presidential candidate by the ruling APC and without a concurrent Southern presidential standard bearer in the PDP, those key oil-rich Southern states could be won by APC, while not losing much ground in the north.\n\nAnother factor that many are currently considering as likely to work in favour of the APC is the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso\u2019s national movement, otherwise known as the third force.\n\nThe movement could divide the PDP further as well as shave valuable votes from the PDP in the North. In other words, the advantage the PDP hopes to gain in the north by potentially fielding a Northerner might be significantly eroded by Kwankwaso\u2019s third force.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Mohammed, who spoke with journalists, shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the PDP would continue to strategise to rescue Nigeria from the present situation she has found herself.\n\nThe governor, who described Obasanjo as a man with a lot of wisdom and an elder statesman per excellence, said he had come to seek his opinion on some of the things going on in the party.\n\nHis words: \u201cTo me, the zoning of Presidency to the South by the APC is not a threat to the PDP, because each party is trying to strategise, to plan and organise. If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory or if we put it to the North, it will give us more electoral victory.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of things we are doing: the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing the past relationship with Obasanjo, Mohammed said the issue of PDP, was basically one of the reasons for his visit.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that Baba is non-partisan; we know he is an elder statesman per excellence. But, we are rebuilding our party to remove rancour, division and so on. So, we still need him, because his words of wisdom are always very useful.\n\n\u201cSo, I have come to sound his opinion on some of the things going on in the party; to close ranks and make sure that we provide Nigerians with the opportunity to rescue the country, from the present division going around, which we have found ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bauchi governor expressed optimism about his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket to contest the 2023 election.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo me, presidency is a consensus \u2013 a stakeholder and a statesmanship \u2013 it is responsibilities. Of course, every Nigerian should try to contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation.\n\n\u201cMore so, when leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure that, we bring everybody on board and should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement that are capable of dividing us further.\n\n\u201cNigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my expression, but about the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Polygon\u2019s $450 million raise will enable it build developer ecosystems across the globe",
          "text": "Last month, Polygon raised $450 million, to expand its portfolio of ethereum scaling solutions and footprints in the developer ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain that has attracted developers across the world, but its slow speed and high transaction costs (gas fees) have made many developers reluctant to use it.\n\nPolygon, a side chain firm attached to ethereum, is improving the functionality of the ethereum blockchain by improving transaction speed and cost. While Polygon\u2019s ultimate goal, at least for now, is to scale ethereum, it is processing more transactions than ethereum\u2019s main chain, mostly because of its $1 gas fee cost. As of today, it has processed 3.4 billion transactions and last month claims its 3 million transactions per day volume is double that of ethereum.\n\nOver the past few years, Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, has grown to host over 7,000 decentralised applications, including metaverse projects like Decentraland and Sandbox; popular NFT marketplace OpenSea; and DeFi projects such as Aave, Curve, Pool, Uniswap, etc.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder has said that its $450 million funding is to help Polygon build larger developer ecosystems in several markets. At the forefront of this expansion strategy is Nigeria\u2019s Shodipo Ayomide, Polygon\u2019s new Global Head of Developer Advocacy.\n\nBefore Polygon, Ayomide had previously worked with Nigerian tech publication TechPoint as a software engineer, VanHack as a developer advocate, and Stack Overflow also as a developer advocate. Ayomide had rejected multiple managerial and director-level positions to accept his offer at Polygon because he believes \u201cit is the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on money or passion, but what excites me is a place I am building something that a billion people are using or is impacting a billion people around the globe. It means I am part of something huge and something bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nAyomide will be working with various teams like the hackathon, community, content team, and an engineering and open-source team, to create written and video content, organise meetups and establish relationships in the Web3 ecosystem of cities across the world.\n\nOne of the developer ecosystem expansion strategies is to establish Polygon Guilds, a structure that will help educate \u201cWeb2 developers\u201d and onboard them to Web3. This guild model will adopt a similar approach to Google Developer Group, a small meetup across different locations where people can learn about Google technologies.\n\nPolygon Guilds are in over 19 cities, a large number of them are in Africa\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Delta, Warri, Port Harcourt, Nairobi, and Mombasa. Polygon is also expanding its presence in France, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Polygon created the Polygon Academy, which intends to be a comprehensive guide for anybody that wants to understand Web3. This academy consists of eight modules and learners will earn an NFT when they complete them.\n\nThe end game of Polygon, Naiwal also said, is to become the AWS of Web3, and if Web3 is going to be as big as investors are saying it would be, its recent efforts will no doubt be a win for African developers.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Solving Africa\u2019s tech talent problem: All hands on deck",
          "text": "When Joseph* graduated from university in 2019, he expected to secure a well paying job but didn\u2019t expect his search to take so long. Two years later, still in his early 20s, he resorted to cab-driving in Accra, Ghana, while he kept looking.\n\n\u201cI left Nigeria to study in Ghana and decided to remain here. Things are calmer here, although not necessarily easier,\u201d Joseph, who is originally Nigerian, tells me during a ride in his cab.\n\nHe goes on to speak about the difficulty around getting better accommodation and making ends meet. The car he uses was bought on hire purchase; he\u2019s still paying for it.\n\nJoseph is one of Ghana\u2019s 15 million underemployed population. 13.4% of Ghana\u2019s population are unemployed, according to data released by the Ghana Statistical Service in December 2021.\n\nOn the other end of town, Meghan McCormick, founder of OZ\u00c9, is looking for experienced hires. OZ\u00c9 is a Ghana-based fintech company that helps SMEs record transactions and access to financing.\n\n\u201cIn the past 6 weeks, we\u2019ve been hiring for 15 roles and have only been able to fill 4. It\u2019s been difficult getting a senior UI/UX designer, data analyst, and product managers,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cIt feels like everyone is trying to pivot to product management, but they don\u2019t have enough experience.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2017, OZ\u00c9, which has over 125,000 users across Ghana and Nigeria, is at a stage where hiring the right-skilled persons is a major challenge. Although keen on hiring Africans, if that\u2019s not possible, McCormick will have to look outside the continent.\n\nOZ\u00c9 isn\u2019t alone: many African startups are in a similar situation. The prevalence of talent scarcity highlights a fascinating irony about Africa: despite having a high rate of unemployed and underemployed persons, businesses on the continent struggle to find the right talent to fill in key roles.\n\nAccording to a 2021 Bloomberg report South Africa has the highest unemployment rate (34.4%) on a global list of 82 countries. Closely behind on that list are Namibia (33.4%), and Nigeria (33.3%) coming in second and third respectively.\n\nA popular and widely accepted explanation for this discrepancy is the gap between the skills the unemployed and underemployed Africans possess and the expected skills they need to excel on the job.\n\nGranted, there aren\u2019t even enough jobs on the continent; only 3 million formal jobs are created annually in Africa, according to a 2015 report by the African Development Bank, while 10 million to 12 million youth enter the workforce in Africa each year. So, many graduates end up doing work outside of what they trained for in school.\n\nBut, while the demand for job creation is valid, there\u2019s a need to look into how to solve the current problem of ensuring that the existing vacant jobs are filled in the first place. The answer, it appears, doesn\u2019t reside in one approach.\n\n\u201cOur fight is against hunger\u201d\n\nA typical response to the issue of low/unskilled workers is to train them. A champion of this approach was Andela, which trained African developers for the first few years of its existence before evolving to become a network that hires senior developers from around the world to work for predominantly American companies.\n\nBuilding on lessons from Andela and companies like Decagon and Semicolon involved in training African tech talents, Adewale Yusuf decided to co-found TalentQL in 2020.\n\nTalentQL started out as a recruitment agency for international and national companies. But, along the way, the need to train applicants became apparent, as many African engineers were failing the tests.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that a lot of people were self-taught; school didn\u2019t prepare them for the roles they were applying for,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\nThis led to the creation of a training programme called Pipeline, a 6-month coaching programme focused on technical and soft skills. With the help of African engineers at big tech companies like Twitter, Amazon, and Spotify, the pilot cohort of 14 intermediate software engineers were trained to become world-class engineers.\n\nDespite initial scepticism, the programme turned out successful. Seeing that the Pipeline model worked, Yusuf and the TalentQL team decided to create a similar programme for those with little or no experience, scaling them up to junior level experience. This birthed AltSchool Africa, a virtual year-long training programme at the end of which participants gained a diploma in software engineering, in affiliation with a reputable and accredited university.\n\nTo ease the burden of paying for tuition, AltSchool Africa employs an income-sharing agreement where students only pay for their tuition when they get jobs upon graduation. They\u2019re expected to pay $500, which can be paid in full or in installments\u2014$50 over 10 months, or $100 over 5 months.\n\nAltSchool Africa\u2019s maiden edition has over 9,000 applicants from over 17 countries, with the top countries represented being Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda.\n\n\u201cOur courses are based on research,\u201d says Yusuf. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what will be relevant in the next 5 years. There are some jobs that don\u2019t exist yet but will soon need developer support. These are the jobs we are training people for.\u201d\n\nAlthough TalentQL and AltSchool Africa are related, graduates of AltSchool Africa don\u2019t automatically gain access to Pipeline until they gain some working experience.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to help someone in Akoko, Akure, earn \u20a6100,000\u2013\u20a6200,000 every month and provide for their family. Our fight is against hunger.\u201d\n\nWhile AltSchool Africa started off focused on training software engineers, there are plans to add other specialisations such as product design and marketing, blockchain, and data analytics.\n\n\u201cA country like Ukraine decided to revamp their curriculum to make sure they are churning out engineers. We can\u2019t keep teaching programming languages like COBOL and Fortran in our schools,\u201d Yusuf says. TalentQL is also engaging with the Nigerian government to review its policies and the educational curriculum.\n\nA nudge in the right direction\n\nTraining programmes come and go, but wouldn\u2019t a lifetime mentor and community be better? That\u2019s part of the thinking that spurred the creation of Fuzu, a career platform launched in Kenya in 2015.\n\n\u201cOne key thing I\u2019ve learnt from our conversation with Africans is that they need someone to help them along their career journey. Fuzu is trying to fill that gap,\u201d Jussi Hinkkanen, Fuzu\u2019s CEO, says.\n\nSeven years later, now in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, Fuzu\u2019s major appeal is that it not only connects Africans to job opportunities, it provides them with relevant resources\u2014courses, articles, and CV building\u2014based on their career path and goal. It acts as a virtual mentor and community that looks out for a person all through their career.\n\nSince inception, Fuzu has supported over 12 million Africans and seen a 57% increase in skills gained by Fuzu career builders who use its Instant Feedback tool. Kadundo Jacob is one of the millions, who secured his first and current job as a medical representative in Kenya. The company also adds that professionals who use its CV creator tool are 46% more likely to get promoted while those who complete at least 1 course within 18 months are 26% more likely to get promoted.\n\nTurning passions into livelihood\n\nIn the past few years, the internet has facilitated the rise of the passion economy\u2014a new wave of niche communities of people monetising their skills, whether it\u2019s running online classes, selling digital books, or copywriting. Africans are not left out of this movement and Mylene Flicka\u2019s Irawo, a platform that teaches Africans how to monetise their skills, is there to help.\n\nWith as low as $100, individuals can sign up for a training programme on Irawo\u2019s website and end up like Ife Kohossi, who now earns about $2,000 per month from teaching people to eat better and live healthier lives. Kohossi decided to set out on her own after several failed attempts to get a job.\n\n\u201cWhen she first came, she didn\u2019t know how to use a Facebook page to create a community. After passing through Irawo\u2019s programme Kohossi learnt how to use online tools and market her business better,\u201d says Flicka. In the case of Irawo, the training is focused on teaching Africans how to use online tools like Social media and eCommerce stores to amplify the reach of their service or product.\n\nBeyond the training, the participants are connected to mentors and they become part of a large community that continually provides useful tools and education. Irawo started in the Republic of Benin and now caters to Africans in french-speaking countries around the world\u2014proof that there\u2019s a growing interest from African creators.\n\nCompeting for a prize\n\nOver the years, companies have come to see hackathons as an opportunity to crowdsource new product ideas and also recruit talent.\n\nFor Foster Akugri, founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation focused on preparing young people for future jobs, he realised that hackathons were also helping participants upskill quickly. While the annual hackathons aren\u2019t necessarily a training ground, Akugri explained that Hacklab organises some training for the participants after the theme of the hackathon is introduced. The intending participants are exposed to resource materials about a new trend or technology, this helps the participants upskill to compete for the coveted cash prize of $10,000\u2013$20,000 with additional benefits.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s theme is edge computing, so we\u2019ve started engaging edge computing leading technology firms like in Nvidia and Intel,\u201d Akugri says. \u201cWhat we do is that beyond asking these firms for financial support, we create workshops to teach participants on the fundamentals of the technologies we are focusing on.\u201d\n\nThe partner companies also give users free access to paid tools for a short duration to practise.\n\nSince 2015, the different hackathons have covered topics such as artificial intelligence, Blockchain and eCommerce. Over the span of 8 Hackathons there\u2019s been over 300 job placements and 9 companies started, an indication of the program\u2019s impact.\n\n\u201cSome of the partner firms like Stanbic Bank and Vodafone are recruiting not less than 15 people every year from our Hackathons,\u201d Akuri added, emphasising the relevance of the Hackathon in upskilling these talents and getting them jobs.\n\nGlobally, the demand for talent outstrips supply and Africa is no exception. There are just 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. Compare that to California, which has 630,000, out of a total population of 39 million.\n\nBuilding enough tech talents for the continent will require the combined efforts of different players. African companies can also do their bit by upskilling their staff, enabling them to move departments, championing documentation processes that help new employees to settle seamlessly into their roles, and offering fine working conditions that motivate even people outside tech, who are willing and ambitious, to transition into the industry.\n\nAs the cab trip with Joseph comes to an end, he asks if moving to Lagos could offer him a better chance. He still hopes to secure a well paying job. I share a few thoughts, alight and slowly walk away, thinking about how there are others like Josephs out there.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "TradeDepot, a leading B2B e-commerce and embedded finance platform in Africa, on Wednesday said it has acquired Green Lion, a competitor which it describes as the biggest and fastest-growing B2B e-commerce platform in Ghana. The move is meant to help TradeDepot accelerate the delivery of its services across the West African country.\n\nFounded in 2018, Green Lion enables digital commerce for neighbourhood retailers in Ghana. Building on this work, TradeDepot will leverage its data, technology, and robust logistics operations to connect more retailers in more Ghanaian cities to suppliers and make financing more accessible and affordable, the company said in a statement.\n\nAccording to data cited by TradeDepot, Ghana\u2019s retail sector is valued at $24.4 billion and is expected to reach $33.16 billion by 2024, with SME retailers accounting for about 90% of the market.\n\n\u201cGhana represents a significant market for consumer goods in Africa and we are excited to bring the Green Lion team onboard to drive growth and prosperity for more retailers and distributors in the country,\u201d said Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot already has active operations in Ghana, as well as its operations in Nigeria and South Africa, and this acquisition is expected to expedite the delivery of its services to more cities to enable increased sales, higher margins, and other value-added services for all parties across the retail value chain.\n\nTradeDepot has built a network of leading consumer goods brands and SME retailers across Africa and created a proprietary risk scoring engine that uses retailers\u2019 purchase history, previous repayment performance, and other related data points to predict their creditworthiness.\n\nThrough its ShopTopUp platform, the company offers a broad range of consumer goods to SME retailers within its network and provides credit lines to enable retailers to access inventory and pay in instalments as they sell on to their own customers.\n\n\u201cIt is an exciting time for B2B e-commerce in Africa and we are thrilled by the opportunity to drive more value in the Ghanaian ecosystem and all over the continent,\u201d Jorge de Rojas from Green Lion added.\n\nTradeDepot will take on all existing Green Lion Africa relationships and assets in Ghana, the company said. In addition, the Green Lion team will join TradeDepot to support its mission to \u201cbuild the future of retail and make food and supplies more accessible and affordable for even the most remote consumers\u201d in Africa.\n\nThe TradeDepot-Green Lion deal is the latest in a string of acquisition deals the African tech landscape has witnessed since the year began. Late January, Egyptian-American cloud security startup Magalix was acquired by Weaveworks Limited, a GitOps company with headquarters in London and San Francisco, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThis month, there have been at least four mergers and acquisitions (M&A) announcements involving African startups.\n\nKenyan insurance technology company Lami bought Bluewave Insurance Agency, another insurtech startup in the country, pan-African fintech Branch International acquired a majority stake in Century Microfinance Bank, which provides financial services to micro, small and medium businesses, and last week, Cape Town-based BNPL startup PayJustNow sold an 85% stake to Weaver Fintech.\n\nIn December, TradeDepot announced it had raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round to support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we can all agree on, it\u2019s that our online data is being tracked, one way or the other. From the sites we visit to the apps we download, there\u2019s a lot we share on Obasanjo\u2019s Internet \u2014 inadvertently or not \u2014 that end up in the most unlikely places.\n\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective, say you want to buy your dad a birthday gift. You go to your favourite eCommerce store and pick out some shoes and a nice wristwatch, but you aren\u2019t ready to pay. So you add it to your cart and decide to wait till salary week. After all, dad\u2019s birthday is not for a couple of months.\n\nYou clock off the website and go back to your favourite game. Two minutes into the game, you see an ad for some men\u2019s shoes and even a suit. Strange? Maybe not.\n\nSome say data privacy is a myth, and in a world where the free online services you enjoy require some information in exchange for your non-payment, you might be tempted to agree \u2014 sometimes I am too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last four years, since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) began, some headway has been made to protect personal data. The use of cookies, emphasis on consent, elaborate \u2014 but still insufficient \u2014 rules on data processing, transfer, and tracking are receiving attention.\n\nBig tech companies have become the subject of extreme scrutiny. They have had to backtrack and find ways to protect user privacy due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing.\n\nAs of December 2021, per Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free. On the Apple App store, that number goes down to 94%.\n\nIn April 2021, Apple finally implemented its App Tracking Transparency privacy policy which meant app developers needed to seek the consent of users before their data could be tracked or given to a third party.\n\nBefore this, Apple allowed app developers to track user data either through its Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) or using their own trackers. With ATT, however, once a user chooses to opt-out, app creators would have no access to the IDFA and are urged not to track them on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nFor privacy advocates and enthusiasts, this was a welcome development. As we\u2019ve discussed in previous articles, consent is one of the fundamental tenets in protecting online privacy. Seeing it put front and centre brought tears of joy to the eyes.\n\nBut not everyone was on board with this. For companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), whose 2021 revenue was 97% ads, this was most definitely a stumbling block. With 98.5% of Facebook users accessing the platform via mobile phones, this was, of course, quite worrying.\n\nSo, in February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for \u201csmall businesses everywhere.\u201d However, this was not enough to save them because, by October 2021, investigations by Financial Times showed that Meta, Snap, Twitter, and Google\u2019s YouTube had lost $10 billion in revenue due to Apple\u2019s ATT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Meta believes that they could lose upwards of $10 billion in revenue due to the ATT by the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, while Meta\u2019s actions in February 2021 might not have been entirely altruistic, it did have a point. Meta is the second-biggest digital ad platform after Google. It is heavily relied upon by pretty much everyone for data to run ads and gain insights into customer satisfaction and usage.\n\nFrom publishers to small and medium scale businesses to large corporations, advertising is an essential source of revenue. And to run the targeted ads which Meta promises, real-time/recent data is critical.\n\nThe question now is, how can these companies balance the competing needs of privacy and profit-making?\n\nA sandbox, but for privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the privacy graph\n\nAs of January 2022, 83% of smartphone users in Africa use Android; 70% worldwide. And on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, in a blog post, Google announced that it would be extending its Privacy Sandbox to Android.\n\nAccording to Google, \u201cThe Privacy Sandbox initiative aims to create technologies that both protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers tools to build thriving digital businesses. The Privacy Sandbox reduces cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all.\u201d\n\nSince its inception in 2019, Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox has been mired in controversy. Considering that the company is the largest digital ad platform on the planet and is said to track user behaviour over two-thirds of the Internet, issues were bound to arise.\n\nIn January 2022, the company announced that it was scrapping the controversial Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) and introducing Topics. FLoCs was Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies using technology that aggregated users into groups of users with similar interests.\n\nSide Note: This excerpt from this article by the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains the issues surrounding the use of FLoCs. TL;DR It was a big tattoo on your digital forehead because it tracked your Chrome browser history.\n\nSide Side Note: Unlike my favourite chocolate chip snacks, cookies are text files with small pieces of data \u2014 like a username and password \u2014 that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Using our earlier example, cookies made it easy for them to target those ads at you after logging off the eCommerce website.\n\nBy extending the Privacy Sandbox to Android phones, Google introduces four tools into the equation: Topics, Fledge, SDK Runtime, and Attribution Reporting. These are expected to replace the need for the Google Ad ID (GA ID) \u2014 the equivalent of Apple\u2019s IDFA; although the GA ID is expected to be operational for two more years.\n\nAccording to Daniel Junowicz, Managing Director of LATAM & Africa at AppsFlyer, \u201cThe announcement of the deployment of Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox on Android is an expected continuation of an ecosystem that continues to prioritise user privacy.\n\n\u201cSince Apple\u2019s ATT Framework set the tone for these changes last year, the mobile marketing landscape has continued to innovate and embrace privacy-privacy preserving ways to drive mobile marketing performance.\u201d\n\nX-raying these tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Topics\n\nIn this video by Debby Reynolds, data privacy & protection expert strategist, she gives a high-level explanation of these four tools. According to her, these tools could \u201ccreate less asymmetry in the relationship between consumers and marketers\u201d while still providing some level of information to the marketers.\n\nTopics is a bit similar to FLoCs in that it categorises your interests based on your browsing history. Currently, Google says there are 300 human-curated topics, and it would be adding to the list as it goes on.\n\nTopics gives you the option to delete topics that are associated with you. In addition, when you first visit a site that has integrated the Topics API, you can choose which topics you are interested in on the website. This helps target specific people without revealing specifics like age, gender, or race for ad companies.\n\nSay one of the Topics is \u2018Food\u201d using our earlier example. If the eCommerce website had integrated the Topics API, you could have chosen only to be associated with Food and would not have seen any ads relating to suits or shoes once you logged off.\n\nFledge gives ad companies access to a custom audience of customers that have expressed interest in a particular product before or have bought a product before.\n\nAttribution Reporting prevents companies from getting specific data of a customer that bought a product. So say after you received your salary, you went on to buy your dad the shoes and wristwatch; Google would prevent the ad company from seeing that it was Sophia who lives on 61, Opebi Road, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria that bought a gold wristwatch and size 43 male shoes.\n\nSide Note: Attribution is a way for ad companies to gain bonus points for ads that have converted. Basically, if you buy a product through an ad that was targeted at you, the ad company can use this to gain brownie points and know which ads work or not.\n\nSDK Runtime is a firewalled section of the phone to isolate ad tools to limit their ability to see and record what people do. An SDK (software development kit) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system, or programming language.\n\nThey help developers focus on running their own programme without worrying about having expertise in things like ads or analytics.\n\nWant some more technical knowledge? You can check this out.\n\nBalancing privacy and profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s stake in the ad industry seems to have informed much of what it has proposed. Unlike Apple\u2019s \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, Google\u2019s method appears to be more balanced and considerate of all parties.\n\nGoogle says it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to finetune the Privacy Sandbox as this is not the final iteration. According to the company, this would take a couple of years before it is ready for implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, Android users can manage activity on their Google dashboard and delete web and app activity or location history or whatever they wish to keep anonymous.\n\nReynolds advises that companies find ways to increase their first-party data using giveaways to help foster that.\n\nAs she says, \u201cNothing stops companies from providing incentives to develop first-party relationships with consumers. I think businesses that cannot show how this data exchange benefits consumers will have a hard time getting people to give them data.\u201d\n\nA position Junowicz holds, \u201cFor Android mobile marketers, having the right technology in place will be crucial in order to continue generating valuable insights without compromising on privacy. For example, the use of predictive measurement solutions in conjunction with creative approaches will be vital to retain, engage and monetise users while providing personalised user experience in a privacy-compliant environment.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the development of data cleanroom technologies will offer a neutral, safe space for multiple entities to collaborate using first-party user data.\u2019\u2019\n\nSide Note: First-party data is information a company collects directly from its customers and owns.\n\nThis would, of course, lead to more companies having to comply with data protection regulations and perhaps better data protection and privacy policies.\n\nHowever, these actions serve to further cement Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s hold on the industry. Something to chew on and perhaps worry about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

According to the BBC, Ukraine\u2019s move towards European institutions is the basis of Russia\u2019s problems with Ukraine. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, demands that Ukraine remain neutral.\n\nAs the increasing military presence in Ukraine causes rising tension and panic worldwide, the number of Africans studying in the country becomes a major concern. African students in Ukraine make up 20% of international students. This Quartz Africa article explores the fate of 4,000 Nigerian students studying in Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2017 we conducted a survey showing how much the average Nigerian in tech earns. However, five years have passed, and we want to portray the current situation. If you work in tech, please take this quick survey and help update our data.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTradeDepot\u2019s acquisition of Green Lion\n\nVoyance\u2019s $500k pre-seed\n\nTradeDepot acquires Green Lion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSince my induction into the tech ecosystem, I\u2019ve considered the African market unprepared for eCommerce.\n\nHowever, recent investments, acquisitions, and a renewed business model is boosting my confidence in the sector.\n\nWhile we are on the topic, African eCommerce and embedded finance platform, TradeDepot has acquired Green Lion, Ghanaian B2B eCommerce startup.\n\nThis comes two months after TradeDepot raised $110 million in equity and debt financing to offer its buy now, pay later (BNPL) services for African informal businesses.\n\nTradeDepot has a presence in Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana. And this acquisition sees the absorption of a significant Ghanaian competitor in a $24.4 billion retail market.\n\nTwinning: Founded in 2018, Green Lion digitises the operations of neighbourhood retailers and ensures a constant supply of essential goods. Interestingly, both companies operate the same B2B eCommerce model.\n\nTradeDepot wants to leverage Green Lion\u2019s data, technology, and robust logistics to connect more neighbourhood retailers in Ghana to suppliers.\n\nA profitable model? TradeDepot has grown the merchants on its platform by 150% \u2014 40,000 to 100,000 \u2014 in just one year. Its B2B model combined with its BNPL feature allows retailers to get goods without payment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, the B2B eCommerce model appears to be the rave of the moment, with platforms like Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Marketforce playing in the space.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to know why investors are putting their money in eCommerce in Africa, you can revisit this: Betting $165 million on Africa\u2019s B2B eCommerce in 2021\n\nVoyance bags $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoyance team Source: Instagram\n\nNigerian data science startup, Voyance, has raised $500,000 in a pre-seed round led by Beta.Ventures.\n\nWhat does Voyance do? Founded in 2019 by Ebot Tabi and current Mono CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, the startup provides a no-code data infrastructure for businesses. The platform requires little to no data science expertise to analyse essential data.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with Techpoint Africa, Hassan described the company as \u201ca machine learning platform which allows businesses to upload their data and predict what matters to them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the pre-seed raise, Voyance has also launched two flagship products, Manhattan DB and Sigma. Per Benjamin Dada, Manhattan DB can help data scientists and engineers process large data and build machine learning models.\n\nIts second flagship product is a risk operations platform that can help businesses discover and address problems.\n\nOvo Emorhokpor, General Partner, Beta.Ventures reiterated the startup\u2019s mission to simplify and democratise access to data science.\n\nHe said, \u201cVoyance is building critical infrastructure to enable small and large businesses to turn their raw data into advanced analytics and design machine learning models to make insightful business predictions.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOnwardMobility, a startup that planned to revitalize the BlackBerry brand with a 5G Android device, confirmed that it\u2019s shutting down.

From telling the stories of Africa\u2019s entrepreneurs to facilitating conversations and connections, we\u2019ve done our bit in fostering growth, but we\u2019re not done.\n\nWe\u2019re bringing back Pitch Friday \u2014 a monthly event where early-stage founders come to pitch their businesses or ideas before a live audience.\n\nThe first edition will be held on Friday, March 11, 2022, and you can either register to be a part of the audience or pitch your startup. We\u2019d appreciate it if you could spread the word on your social media platforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow to our subjects for the day.\n\nWe\u2019re discussing how to spot NFT scams and MarketForce\u2019s $40 million war chest.\n\nHow to spot NFT scams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, blockchain technology has shot into the limelight. With its promise of anonymity and speedy transactions not limited by national borders, there has been no shortage of adopters and even evangelists.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all we have to thank the blockchain for, with NFTs generating almost as much attention as the technology. Where artists had to wait for their work to be commissioned \u2014 often by individuals in the same geographical location \u2014 they can now create and sell art for astonishing prices. Admittedly, art is not the only use case for NFTs, but it is currently the most popular.\n\nWith the often mind-boggling prices NFTs sell for, it is perhaps no surprise that they have been used in fraudulent activities, with wash trading and money laundering the most common cases.\n\nIdeally, we would expect governments to curb these issues, but NFTs are not regarded as securities, and it has become difficult to establish what is a scam. Fortunately, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun has some tips on identifying NFT scams, and you can read all about it in Wash trading scams and money laundering; why NFT traders should be careful.\n\nMarketForce raises $40 million to provide BNPL to merchants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketForce co-founders. Source: TechCrunch\n\nMost African households depend on informal retailers for their supplies. As tech eased operations in other industries, a few entrepreneurs built solutions for the eCommerce space.\n\nInitially, these solutions were B2C, but in the last few years, the focus seems to have shifted to serving the small businesses that drive commerce on the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the players in this industry \u2013 MarketForce \u2013 has raised a $40 million Series A to offer buy now, pay later (BNPL) services to its customers.\n\nV8 Capital Partners led the round, with Cellulant Co-founder, Ken Njoroge, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, Vu Ventures, Vastly Valuable Ventures, Uncovered Fund, Reflect Ventures, Greenhouse Capital, Century Oak Capital, and Remapped Ventures participating.\n\nLast year, the startup raised $2 million in a pre-Series A round, including $150,000 from Y Combinator. Following that, it launched in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. At the time, it had just launched RejaReja to enable retailers to get next-day deliveries for products.\n\nWith its latest raise, the startup plans to grow its team to 800 while growing the number of merchants on RejaReja to 250,000 in the next few months.\n\nMarketForce is not the only startup digitising the informal retail experience, with TradeDepot, SokoWatch, Omnibiz, and Alerzo doing the same.\n\nWith low spending power and a lack of proper addressing systems limiting B2C startups, the focus has shifted to B2B. Yet, there remains a vast market opportunity for startups. A 2020 report by the International Trade Center found that ten countries accounted for 94% of all online businesses in Africa. As mobile and Internet penetration increases on the continent, more countries could get a piece of the eCommerce pie.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happens to all your online shopping returns\n\nThe moral calculations of a billionaire\n\nOpportunities\n\nAltSchool Africa is hiring.

He said Russia doesn\u2019t plan to \u201coccupy\u201d its southern neighbor, but that Russia must \u201cdefend itself from those who took Ukraine hostage\u201d \u2014 the U.S. and its allies who had crossed Russia\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d with expansion of the NATO alliance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called the move \u201can unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces\u201d and said the \u201cworld will hold Russia accountable.\u201d Biden added that he would meet his Group of Seven counterparts Thursday and then speak to the American people to announce further punishments that would be placed on Moscow.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cRussia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.\u201d\n\nRead also: How Russia/Ukraine brawl will affect Nigeria\u2019s economy\n\nRussia is a key supplier of energy to global customers, with Europe relying on the nation for about a quarter of its oil supplies and a third of its gas.\n\nThe escalation spooked a market that was already under stress, as oil supplies around the world fail to keep pace with the vigorous recovery in demand from the pandemic.\n\nThe OPEC+ coalition led by Saudi Arabia is struggling to restore production quickly enough, prompting some of the biggest market players to warn of an increasingly tight market.\n\nOil prices are likely to average $110 in the second quarter as tensions over Ukraine continue to escalate, said JPMorgan Chase & Co. this week.\n\nThe crude market is likely to see sustained higher prices in the next quarter, before retreating to average $90 at the end of the year, it said.\n\nThe Biden administration is considering tapping its emergency supply of oil again in coordination with allies to counter a surge in prices brought on by Russia\u2019s moves against Ukraine.\n\nThe White House earlier announced sanctions on some Russian banks, sovereign debt and elites.\n\nCrude\u2019s return to triple digits completes a prodigious recovery \u2014 barely imaginable a year ago \u2014 as the market flips from surplus to scarcity. It reflects a global economy rushing back to normality from Covid-19 faster than it can secure supplies of raw materials of all kinds.\n\n\u201cAs demand recovers to pre-Covid levels, supply is really having a hard time,\u201d said Giovanni Serio, global head of market analysis at Vitol Group, the world\u2019s biggest independent oil trader.",

          "text": "In a bid to make more of their equities available to the investing public, newly listed BUA Foods plc, Notore Chemical Industries plc, UPDC plc and Transcorp Hotels plc are among the seven companies that have set timelines to sell down the shares of their controlling investors.\n\nOther companies that have provided their compliance timelines are Arbico plc, LivingTrust Mortgage Bank plc, and Prestige Assurance plc.\n\nThe NGX Regulation Limited\u2019s (NGX RegCo) X-Compliance Report shows that no fewer than 21 listed companies on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) have majority of their shares still in the hands of controlling-interest investors as against being in the hands of public investors thereby making them deficient in the free-float requirement in line with listing rules.\n\nWhat is a free float?\n\nFree float represents the portion of shares of a corporation that is in the hands of public investors as opposed to locked-in shares held by promoters, company officers or controlling-interest investors. It provides a more accurate reflection of what public investors consider the company to be worth.\n\nThe float is calculated by subtracting the locked-in shares from outstanding shares. For example, a company may have 20 million outstanding shares, with 6 million of them in a locked-in position; this company\u2019s float would be 14 million.\n\nFor instance, the listing of BUA Foods on the NGX creates access for public participation in the ownership of the company, contributes to the growth of the NGX and positions the company to access long-term capital.\n\nThey are to provide quarterly disclosure reports\n\n\u201cThe Board of NGX RegCo considered and approved an extended time frame for the companies to regain compliance with the listings requirement. The companies are however required to also provide quarterly disclosure reports to NGX RegCo detailing their level of implementation of the compliance plans,\u201d the report stated. BusinessDay check shows that only seven companies (about 33.3%) of the 21 companies the NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo) listed provided their compliance due dates.\n\n\u201cThe listing creates liquidity and tradability of BUA Foods\u2019 shares for existing shareholders and an opportunity for the public to participate in the growth of BUA Foods. The liquidity and tradability will create price discovery for the shares over time.\n\nRead also: NGX RegCo absorbs self from determining prices companies list shares\n\n\u201cThe Exchange has very thorough Corporate Governance standards that all listed entities must align with. BUA Foods is already dedicated to best Corporate Governance practices. The Listing provides a chance for the Company to further ensure transparency across its operations,\u201d Ayodele Abioye, acting managing director, BUA Foods, said at the Facts Behind the Listing presentation.\n\nThe companies\u2019 shares outstanding as against free float\n\nThese companies, their free float percentage and compliance due dates include Arbico (19.96%/June 15, 2023). Arbico, which has 148.5 million shares outstanding, trades at N1.03 per share on Tuesday, February 22. The company is listed on the building construction subsector of the Construction/Real Estate sector of NGX.\n\nShares outstanding refers to the total number of shares a company has issued, while the free floats are its shares that are publicly owned, unrestricted and available on the open market.\n\nBUA Foods, which is listed on the foods products subsector of the Consumer Goods sector, trades at N61.4 per share. BUA Foods has outstanding shares of 18 billion units. BUA Foods free float is 0.17 percent and its timeline for compliance is January 4, 2023. The company on January 5, 2022, listed by introduction on the Main Board of The Exchange its 18 billion shares at N40 per share.\n\nLivingTrust Mortgage Bank, which trades at N1.24 per share, has outstanding shares of 5 billion units. It is listed on the Growth Board of the Mortgage Carriers, Brokers subsector of the financial services sector. LivingTrust Mortgage Bank free float is 0.08 percent with regulatory compliance timeline of August 20, 2023.\n\nThis list includes Notore Chemical Industries with free float of 10.02 percent and June 15, 2023 compliance date. Notore Chemical Industries, which trades at a 52-week high of N62.5 per share as at Tuesday as against a corresponding 52-week low of N56.25, is listed on the agro-allied and chemicals subsector of the Industrial Goods sector of the NGX Main Board. Its shares outstanding are 1.612 billion units.\n\nPrestige Assurance has 15.46 percent free float and August 20, 2024, compliance timeline. At 45kobo per share, Prestige Assurance with shares outstanding of 13.252 billion units heads back to its 52-week low of 40kobo per share.\n\nTranscorp Hotels has 5.47 percent free float and October 3, 2023, timeline for compliance. Transcorp Hotels listed on the Hotels/Lodging subsector of the Services sector of the Main Board trades at N5.38 per share and has outstanding shares of 10.242 billion units; while UPDC, which has 4.98 percent free float and August 10, 2023, timeline trades at N1.07 per share. The company, which is listed on the Real Estate Development subsector of the Construction/Real Estate sector of the NGX Main Board, has shares outstanding of 18.559 billion units.\n\n\u2026 and so what?\n\nStocks with smaller floats tend to be more volatile than those with larger floats.\n\nThe NGX RegCo transparency initiative\n\nThe X-Compliance Report is a transparency initiative of The NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo), which is designed to maintain market integrity and protect investors by providing compliance-related information on all listed companies. The report shows companies that are still deficient in their free float. It also shows those that have applied for waivers from the Board of NGX RegCo, and have specifically provided compliance plans with tentative timelines to support their requests.\n\nThe companies that are deficient in their free float but did not provide time frame for compliance according to NGX RegCo are: Abbey Mortgage Bank (11.35%); Aluminium Extrusion Industries (16.27%); Austin Laz & Company (19.36%), Capital Hotels (3.18%), Champion Breweries (5.23%); CWG (15.97%); Ekocorp (12.64%); Golden Guinea Breweries (15.24%); Infinity Trust Mortgage Bank (0.94%); and International Breweries (11.07%).\n\nThe list also includes Medview Airline (14.16%); The Tourist Company of Nigeria (1.75%); Union Bank of Nigeria (12.95%), and Union Dicon Salt (18%).\n\nNGX listing requirement\n\nCompanies listed on NGX are required to maintain a minimum free float for the set standards under which they are listed in order to ensure that there is an orderly and liquid market for their securities.\n\nThe free float requirement for companies listed on the Growth Board is a minimum of 10 percent of the issued and fully paid up shares or the value of its free float is equal to or above N50 million, for the entry segment. Also for Growth Board, a minimum of 15 percent of the issued and fully paid up shares or the value of its free float is equal to or above N50 million, for standard segment.\n\nFor ASeM, NGX RegCo rule requires a minimum of 15 percent of issued and fully paid up shares or the value of its free float is equal to or above N50 million. For the Main Board, it is a minimum of 20 percent of the issued and fully paid up shares or the value of its free float is equal to or above N20 billion; while for Premium Board, it is a minimum of 20 percent of issued and fully paid up shares or the value of its free float is equal to or above N40 billion.",

          "text": "Oil prices rose more than 4% on news of the military operation on news that Russia was launching a military attack in Ukraine.\n\nU.S. crude futures jumped by 4.73% to trade at $96.46 per barrel, CNBC reported.\n\nBrent crude futures were up 4.69% at $101.93 per barrel, crossing the $100 level for the first time since 2014.\n\nNatural gas prices jumped 4.7%. Spot gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, rose 1.82% and last traded at $1,942.26.\n\nExplosions were heard in Ukraine\u2019s capital of Kyiv, NBC News reported.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met in New York late Wednesday as representatives from member states pleaded with Putin not to attack Ukraine.\n\nPutin warned other countries that there would be \u201cconsequences they have never seen,\u201d if there\u2019s an attempt to interfere with Russia\u2019s action, Reuters reported.\n\nGoldman Sachs said in a Wednesday report that the impact on energy prices should be limited. \u201cWhile Europe imports a large share of its natural gas consumption from Russia, the US is a net exporter of natural gas and any spillover effects on US gas prices should be modest, analysts at the Wall Street bank said.\n\n\u201cOur commodities strategists also expect only a modest impact on oil prices, though they see the risks as skewed to the upside because the oil market is already tight.\u201d\n\nRussian prePutin declared a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, and Kyiv has confirmed the start of hostilities in a devastating new chapter for Europe.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday morning local time that he is launching a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, a move that was followed up by reports of explosions around cities, including Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, and the capital, Kyiv, vox.com reported.\n\nThe Ukrainian foreign minister also confirmed that \u201cPutin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strike.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s attempt to redraw the map of Europe could lead into the most devastating conflict on the continent since World War II. It could cost thousands of civilians lives and create hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s declaration came while the United Nations Security Council held a special session in New York on the Ukraine crisis, and bombing began shortly thereafter, according to multiple news reports. In his address, Putin claimed \u201cto defend people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the Kyiv regime,\u201d a reference to a false claim about the government in Ukraine. Putin claimed that the Russian military seeks \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d but not occupation. He demanded Ukraine lay down its weapons or be \u201cresponsible for bloodshed.\u201d\n\nExactly what\u2019s happening on the ground in Ukraine is hard to know. And the world may not fully understand what is happening on the ground as it\u2019s unfolding. Russia has already used misinformation tactics and will likely jam up local communications. But it\u2019s hard to interpret what Putin said as anything other than a declaration of war, according to Vox.com\n\nThe tension over Ukraine has been building for months, but escalated quickly this week, when, on Monday, Putin delivered an hour-long and combative speech that essentially denied Ukrainian statehood. He recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine where Moscow has backed separatists since 2014, and sent in so-called peacekeeping forces into the region. As experts said, this was likely beginning, not the end, and the stage for a much larger conflict.\n\nPutin\u2019s escalation comes after the United States warned, again and again, that a larger invasion by Putin was imminent, and after the US and its European allies imposed significant \u2014 but far from all-encompassing \u2014 sanctions on Moscow.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement following Putin\u2019s announcement. \u201cRussia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.\u201d\n\nBut Ukraine \u2014 and the world \u2014 is right now in a perilous and unpredictable moment. moment. Hours before Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an impassioned speech against war, one directed to Russian audience, as a final plea: \u201cWar takes away guarantees for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will have any kind of guarantees of security. And who will suffer from that the most? People.\u201d\n\nOver the last few months, Putin had amassed close to 190,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, a force that military analysts said was clearly prepared and ready to launch an invasion.\n\nUkraine is also a larger stage for Russia to try to reassert its influence in Europe and the world, and for Putin to cement his legacy, and reclaim a semblance of the Russian empire that was lost after the fall of the Soviet Union following the end of the Cold War.\n\nLast year, Russia presented the US with a list of demands, some of which were nonstarters for the United States and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin demanded that NATO stop its eastward expansion and deny membership to Ukraine, and also made other demands for \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d around NATO.\n\nUkraine is the fourth largest recipient of military funding from the US, and the intelligence cooperation between the two countries has deepened in response to threats from Russia. But Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership is not at all an imminent possibility. Still, Moscow\u2019s demand was largely seen as a non-starter by the West, as NATO\u2019s open-door policy says sovereign countries can choose their own security alliances.\n\nThough Putin has continued to tout the threat of NATO, his speech on Monday revealed that this is much more than that. He does not see the government in Ukraine as legitimate: \u201cUkraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood,\u201d Putin said.\n\nAs experts said, it is difficult to square that speech with any sort of realistic diplomatic outcome to seriously avert conflict \u2014 for Putin, regime change in Ukraine appeared to be the underlying goal. Putin\u2019s speech Monday was essentially a confession that this wasn\u2019t really about NATO, said Dan Baer, the acting director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) from 2013 to 2017. \u201cIt was about that he doesn\u2019t think Ukraine has a right to exist as a free country,\u201d he said before Putin\u2019s escalation Wednesday night.\n\nWhat we know so far\n\nWhatever Putin has unleashed is still unfolding. The Ukrainian interior minister has told CNN that the \u201cinvasion has begun.\u201d There are reports of explosions around major cities, something Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister confirmed.\n\nReuters also reported Russian troops landing in two Ukrainian cities, Mariupol and Odessa, and a Ukrainian official confirmed to MSNBC that troops were in at least one of them.\n\nBut the start of wars are messy and chaotic and confusing, often deliberately so, and so there is not a lot that we know right now, and we may not know for some time.\n\nThe United States has said it will not involve troops in any Ukrainian conflict, though the US has added troops to NATO\u2019s eastern flank. That leaves sanctions as the main tool against Russia, and the US and its European allies are likely to place another round of much tougher sanctions on Russia following a first round of penalties that did little to deter Moscow.\n\nZelensky convened a security council meeting in the early hours of Thursday to impose martial law, according to multiple news reports.\n\nWhat this all means for Ukraine, for Europe, for all the world is still really unclear. The Biden administration has warned that a war in Ukraine could kill as many as 50,000 civilians, and spark a refugee crisis that forces between one and five million to flee. This comes with a cost for Russia too, as it could face thousands of casualties. A pathway to out of this crisis does not appear to exist right now, and to get there may mean incalculable and unpredictable costs for Ukraine, and for Russia.",

          "text": "Chief executive officer (CEO) of the National Library of Nigeria (NLN), Professor Chinwe Anunuobi has said the apex library in the country will embark on the collation and documentation of Nigerian families ancestry in indigenous languages as a means of preserving indigenous mother tongues.\n\nThe national librarian made this known at the conference on the \u201cUse of Technology for Multilingual Learning: Challenges and Opportunities,\u201d organized by the apex library to mark UN International Mother Language Day celebrated annually on February 21.\n\nLamenting the state of indigenous languages in Nigeria, Anunobi noted that only 3,000 texts in indigenous languages are available in the entire repository of the national library, noting that both the library and the Nigerian people are doing a poor job in preserving indigenous languages.\n\nShe, however noted that all hope was not lost as Nigeria can learn how best to preserve and digitalize her indigenous languages from countries as Bangladesh, and Bulgaria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo collate Nigerian families ancestry in the major indigenous languages of Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba, the national library will deploy its national Reading Promotion Campaign, RPC, but this time to reach the hard to reach areas documenting popular personalities, events and edifices in the various communities. The library will also work with researchers and scholars to document ancestral histories.\n\n\u201cI know that so many families, institutions, cultures and socio-political and sociocultural issues have gone past us without remembrance. I sat down to look at some edifice and some prominent people in Nigeria, and even those who may not be deemed prominent nationwide, but in their localities and communities they are very strong and powerful people. However, there is no one to tell their stories, or to tell what they have contributed to their communities and to the nation. Hence, the decision to start the family book club.\n\n\u201cThis is a tall order but we have to start somewhere. I believe in the next twenty years, we will be able to tell a great grandchild of, say Sanusi Dantata, \u2018your daddy was a great man,\u2019 and be able to trace his family history and achievements.\n\n\u201cWe will do sensitization to tell them what we have to do, and collaborate with them, with the aid of the traditional rulers,\u201d she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBulgarian Ambassador to Nigeria, Yanko Yordanov noted that the national library is collaborating with the Bulgarian National Library in developing meaningful partnerships between Nigeria and Bugarian libraries.\n\n\u201cThe National Director of the Bulgarian Library is exchanging experience and good practices f what we do in this field with Nigeria. They are two great ladies contributing much to bringing closer our two nations in terms of culture and knowledge.\u201d\n\nResponding to the apex library\u2019s quest for the preservation of indigenous languages, Director American Center, US Embassy in Nigeria, Aondoana Orlu, advised that the languages be preserved in its purest form, both sound and written form, via digitacuration for authenticity\u2019s sake.\n\nThe International Mother Language Day was established in Feb 21, 1999 by the United Nations to commemorate the sacrifice and death of hundreds of people in Bangladesh who fought for the recognition of the Bangla Language. The agency has also marked the year 2022 to 2032 as the decade for the preservation and promotion of indigenous languages across the world.",

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general election, the youth and women wings of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), have endorsed a former governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yerima, for the office of president, stating that he is the best choice for Nigeria come 2023.\n\nThe President of Youth Wing of CAN and the national director, Christian Strategies, Simon Doliy, made this known during Yarima\u2019s meeting and consultation with the Women Wing of CAN (WOWICAN) in Abuja.\n\nDonliy said: \u201cYarima knows the importance of women and youths, that is why he started the consultation with the women group and our youth group.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Muslim and now he has started with the Christians for the 19 northern states and Abuja. So, the essence is for them to know him, how to know his vision as an aspirant for the president of Nigeria come 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own aspirations. I feel that he is the best for the nation this time around because of his long-time experience during his stints as governor and as a Senator, he has all the experiences.\u201d\n\nFor her part, the chairperson of the Women Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria, Mrs Elizabeth Ajegena, stated that the former Zamfara State governor has a positive track record and if given the chance to lead the country as president, he would ensure that peace prevails in Nigeria.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019re here today to the glory of God, for our son Ahmad Sani Yarima, that had been the Governor of Zamfara State. For this, we have had testimony of goodwill about him.\n\n\u201cHe is a man of peace, a man of integrity, he\u2019s a man that accommodates, a man that tolerates. Because of these, he motivated us to come and share with him since he has come out that he wants to become the next president of Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe pray that as he did it in Zamfara State, may the will of God be done and he will continue with that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the WOWICAN Deaconess, Mrs. Victoria Bola Ihesiulor, expressed confidence in the person of Senator Yarima, noting that by this consultation, he has shown that he was ready to work with everyone and he belongs to the class of people whom religious or sectional divide do not influence his decision.\n\n\u201cYarima is a man of peace, tranquility and he is someone who believes in the oneness of Nigeria, you can see from the attendance today, women of the Christian background from all the northern states are consulting with him in order to have a proper decision on who to vote for come 2023,\u201d she said.\n\nPrayers were said for the country and also in his response, Senator Ahmad Sani Yarima expressed satisfaction and assured the groups of his capacity to unite and bring peace to the country.\n\n\u201cIf I become the president of this country, I will ensure we work with you to ensure unity and progress of this country, you will find in me a good leader who will be fair and just to everyone in this country,\u201d Yarima stated.",

          "title": "Hope Of Igbo Presidency Dims Over Killings In South East",
          "text": "The hope of the South East region producing the next president in 2023 could be thwarted as the insecurity caused by the activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the paramilitary wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra separatist movement, continues in the region.\n\nSecurity sources who spoke with LEADERSHIP said the gruesome activities in ESN camps are enormous and there is urgent need to tackle this menace.\n\nJust last week, gunmen suspected to be members of ESN killed eight traders in Abia market at New Cattle market in Omuma-Uzo in Ukwa West local government area of Abia State.\n\nAbia State commissioner for information, Eze Chikamnayo, who confirmed the incident, said gunmen attacked traders at the cattle market on February 15, at about 11:35pm.\n\nThe commissioner said the government responded swiftly by mobilising security agencies to the scene to secure the lives and property of the traders and fish out the assailants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking on attacks like this, the source said this is unsettling the security apparatuses in the country and causing tensions in other regions.\n\nThe source, however, said there are already plans underground to ensure that the South East does not produce the next president as there are fears of escalation of ESN activities if someone from the region becomes president.\n\nTo salvage the situation, the source said leaders from the region must come out and condemn the alleged criminal activities of ESN and IPOB.\n\nFormer Senate president and secretary to the government of the federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, is one of the prominent persons from the southeast contesting the presidency in 2023. Our source claimed that he may have fallen out with his major supporter, the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, but Anyim is still going on with his ambition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough there are some cases of alleged corruption against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Anyim is still a prominent voice in southeast hoping to be president come 2023.\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Groups in Nigeria (CNG) and the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) have condemned the gruesome murder of the traders.\n\nCNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the state government must act quickly to bring the culprits to book even as he warned that the North would no longer tolerate unwarranted attacks on its people living as minorities in the South East or any other part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have studied the unfolding events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against northerners in the South East in particular.\n\n\u201cThe recent attack in Abia has taken matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option in the face of unprovoked evictions, attacks and killings of northerners in various parts of the South East,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the national president of the AYCF, Yerima Shettima, said the group was deeply concerned about the killing of the traders doing their legitimate businesses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile condemning the attack, he welcomed the prompt response of security agencies and urged the state government to pursue its promise to bring the killers to book, in the spirit of national unity and stability.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe AYCF will be closely following the efforts of the Abia State government to fulfill its promise of providing compensation for the families and survivors of the attack. We pray this should be the last bad news we would hear about innocent northern traders, from not just Abia but the entire South East, in the spirit of national unity and stability.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, had commended security agencies for arresting about 30 suspected kidnappers who he described as \u2018cannibals.\n\nOngoing insecurity in the S/E Not Enough To Deny It Presidency, Says Ohanaeze\n\nHowever, the apex Igbo social-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday insisted that the current insecurity in the South East was not enough to deny the zone the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpokesman of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia disclosed this in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Enugu.\n\nOgbonnia insisted that what was happening in the Northern part of Nigeria before Nigerians decided to concede the presidency to President Muhammadu Buhari cannot be compared with what is happening in the South East now.\n\nHe further pointed out that by the time Nigerians conceded presidency to the South West, they were in agitation over the issue of the late Abiola\u2019s presidency and that the presidency was yielded to them as part of ways to compensate them over the issue.\n\nOgbonnia further stated that there was serious youth restiveness in the South South when Nigerians conceded the vice president to the zone.\n\nHe therefore insisted that over 99 percent of people of the South East are agitating for president of South East extraction, adding the less than one percent making negative impact cannot nullify the interest of the majority\n\nTasks Ahead Of 2023 Elections Challenging \u2013 INEC\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has described the task ahead of 2023 and other off-cycle elections in the country as challenging.\n\nThis is even as the nation\u2019s electoral body noted that it will continue to raise the bar of credible elections in Nigeria. INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, said this during a meeting to welcome six new national commissioners and to swear in a resident electoral commissioner in Abuja yesterday.\n\nHe, however, urged them to quickly settle in and familiarise themselves with the rules, procedures, and responsibilities of their offices.\n\nYakubu also urged them to uphold the tenets of integrity, rule of law, and service to the nation in the discharge of their duties.\n\n\u201cOur success in this arduous task draws largely from our integrity as election managers. We must be strict in the application of the law, firm in handling the public trust bestowed on us, and fair in our dealings with political parties, candidates and other stakeholders and all Nigerians,\u201d he told the new members of the election management body.\n\nShortly after administering the oath of office on the new national commissioner, Olaniyi Babalola Ijalaye, a legal practitioner from Ondo State, the INEC chairman deployed him to Ogun State as the new resident electoral commissioner (REC).\n\nHe said, \u201cThe current REC for Ogun State, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, is redeployed to Lagos State where a vacuum was created with the appointment of Mr Sam Olumekun, the immediate past REC of the state as one of the new national commissioners.\u201d\n\nThe other newly sworn-in members of the Commission are Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu, Malam Mohammed Haruna, Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu, Prof. Rhoda Gumus, and Maj. Gen. Modibbo Abubakar Alkalu (retd.)\n\nYakubu noted that four of them were not new to the Commission.\n\nHe said \u201cAgbamuche-Mbu, a lawyer, and Malam Mohammed Haruna, a journalist, have been re-appointed to serve for a second term.\n\n\u201cOlumekun, a retired civil servant, has served for two terms as Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in many states, including Lagos, while Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu has been a career staff of the Commission, rising to the rank of director.\n\n\u201cThe other two national commissioners are Gumus, a professor of Engineering, and Alkali, a retired major general of the Nigerian Army.\u201d\n\nThe INEC boss said that the newly appointed and reappointed officials bring to the Commission their cumulative experiences in diverse fields that will no doubt strengthen the work of the Commission for the reform of the electoral process and the conduct of free, fair, and credible elections.\n\nWith the current appointment, he said the Commission now has the full complement of 12 national commissioners.\n\n\u201cIn discharging our enormous responsibilities, we must abide by our oaths of office. We must continue to defend the choice made by Nigerians at the polls by protecting the sanctity of the vote without which the value of democratic election is diminished,\u201d he added.\n\nElectoral Bill Will Be Signed In Days, Not Weeks \u2013 Adesina\n\nMeanwhile, the special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media, Femi Adesina, has stated that the President will assent to the electoral Bill in a matter of days.\n\nAdesina stated this at the 21st Century Chronicle Roundtable with the theme \u201cGoing for Broke: Fighting Insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned politicians against heating up the polity and pointe out that people had commenced campaigns against the laid-down rules, even as he remarked that election in Nigeria is a natural tension generator.\n\nHe called for sanctions on those breaching the law by campaigning.\n\n\u201cCampaign had already started against the laid-down rules; it started as early as the second term of the president began. Today it is now worse as people are crisscrossing the country. I think those jumping the gun should be penalized.\n\n\u201cIt is very important we should follow the rules; when INEC says we should start campaigns we should. It pays nobody to generate tension. Like I said, the electoral bill would be signed in a matter of hours. It could be days but certainly not weeks.\n\nThe 2023 election would show if we are improving or have not learnt anything,\u201d he added.",

Explosions were also heard in the eastern city of Mariupol, according to AFP.\n\nUS President Biden announced he would address the nation Thursday on \u201cconsequences\u201d for Russia and said the world would \u201chold Russia accountable\u201d for its actions.\n\nHe said a Russian attack would cause \u201ccatastrophic loss of life and human suffering\u201d.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement statement came after the Kremlin said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.\n\nIn response, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional late-night appeal to Russians not to support a \u201cmajor war in Europe\u201d.\n\nSpeaking Russian, Zelensky said that the people of Russia are being lied to about Ukraine and that the possibility of war also \u201cdepends on you\u201d.\n\n\u201cWho can stop (the war)?

These people are among you, I am sure,\u201d he said.\n\nZelensky said he had tried to call Putin but there was \u201cno answer, only silence\u201d, adding that Moscow now had around 200,000 soldiers near Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday the separatist leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk sent separate letters to Putin, asking him to \u201chelp them repel Ukraine\u2019s aggression\u201d, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe two letters were published by Russian state media and were both dated February 22.\n\nTheir appeals came after Putin recognised their independence and signed friendship treaties with them that include defence deals.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Moment of peril\u2019 \u2013\n\nPutin has defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.\n\nHis announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia\u2019s army, navy and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea there by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.\n\nBefore Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.\n\n\u201cWe are united in believing that the future of European security is being decided right now, here in our home, in Ukraine,\u201d President Zelensky said during a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania.\n\nWestern capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.\n\nUkraine has around 200,000 military personnel and Wednesday\u2019s call up could see up to 250,000 reservists aged between 18 and 60 receive their mobilisation papers.\n\nMoscow\u2019s total forces are much larger \u2014 around a million active-duty personnel \u2014 and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.\n\n\u2013 High cost of war \u2013\n\nBut Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.\n\nShelling had intensified in recent days between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists \u2014 a Ukrainian soldier was killed on Wednesday, the sixth in four days \u2014 and civilians living near the front were fearful.\n\nDmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised the two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.\n\n\u201cShe said: \u2018Have you heard the news?\u2019. How could I have known? There\u2019s no electricity, never mind internet. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Russian village around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border, AFP reporters saw military equipment including rocket launchers, howitzers and fuel tanks mounted on trains stretching for hundreds of metres.\n\nRussia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.\n\nWashington Wednesday announced sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Germany had earlier effectively suspended by halting certification.\n\nAustralia, Britain, Japan and the European Union have all also announced sanctions.",
          "summary": "\u201cI have made the decision of a military operation,\u201d Putin said in a surprise television announcement shortly before 6:00am (0300 GMT) in Moscow.\nPutin\u2019s announcement statement came after the Kremlin said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.\nHis announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.\n\u201cPresident Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,\u201d Guterres said.\nBefore Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.",

It is in their hands to meet all the demands not in our hands. If they want it called off this week, next week, it is possible if they should do what they are supposed to do and not all these empty promises that we are not sure they will not implement.

The committee was headed by Professor Manzali and there was a draft proposal which the education ministry has to agree on with them and then break it up to the higher bodies of the government, the Presidential Committee on Salaries, and from there, it goes to FEC for approval.\n\nRead Also\n\nAnambra varsity not part of ASUU strike \u2013 Spokesman\n\nNgige, ASUU trade blame, strike national embarrassment, say Reps\n\nNgige counters ASUU, says talks about non-implementation of agreement untrue\n\n\u201cASUU should not intimidate the education ministry or the committee to come up with things that are not in tandem with the normal rate. if they do that, the document will not fly. The ministry of education will resuscitate that committee within two weeks to look at the draft proposal it had with ASUU so that they can come up with something for the PSC to have a look at and send to FEC\u201d.\n\nOsodeke replied that all the union wanted was for the FG to implement the agreements.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem and we are busy people he might have all the time, our own is for them to implement.\n\n\u201cIf our union could negotiate during the military era and had agreements signed but in the civilian era they are telling us what to do and what not to do, that means something is wrong with this system. What they are doing now is to be blackmailing us and intimidating us.\n\n\u201cWe are just waiting they have said this over and over.

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d was underway.\n\nWeeks of intense diplomacy and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia failed to deter Putin, who had massed between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI have made the decision of a military operation,\u201d Putin said in a surprise television announcement that triggered immediate condemnation from US President Joe Biden and sent global financial markets into turmoil.\n\nShortly after the announcement, explosions were heard in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and several other cities, according to AFP correspondents.\n\nPutin called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and justified the operation by claiming the government was overseeing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in the east of the country.\n\nThe Kremlin had earlier said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.\n\nThe extent of Thursday\u2019s attacks was not immediately clear, but Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the worst-case scenario was playing out.\n\n\u201cPutin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,\u201d Kuleba tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Unprecedented Isolation\u2019 Over Ukraine Attack, Says EU\n\nBiden Says \u2018World Will Hold Russia Accountable\u2019 Over Ukraine Attack\n\nUkrainians Wake Up To Sounds Of bombings As War Hits Home\n\nBiden immediately warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d for Russia and that there would be a \u201ccatastrophic loss of life and human suffering\u201d.\n\nNATO\u2019s chief condemned Russia\u2019s \u201creckless and unprovoked attack\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s move came after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional appeal late on Wednesday night to Russians not to support a \u201cmajor war in Europe\u201d.\n\nSpeaking Russian, Zelensky said that the people of Russia were being lied to about Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said he had tried to call Putin but there was \u201cno answer, only silence\u201d, adding that Moscow now had around 200,000 soldiers near Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday the separatist leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk sent separate letters to Putin, asking him to \u201chelp them repel Ukraine\u2019s aggression\u201d, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe two letters were published by Russian state media and were both dated February 22.\n\nTheir appeals came after Putin recognised their independence and signed friendship treaties with them that include defence deals.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Moment of peril\u2019 \u2013\n\nPutin had for weeks defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.\n\nHis announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia\u2019s army, navy and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea there by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.\n\nBefore Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.\n\n\u201cWe are united in believing that the future of European security is being decided right now, here in our home, in Ukraine,\u201d President Zelensky said during a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania.\n\nWestern capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.\n\nUkraine has around 200,000 military personnel, and could call up to 250,000 reservists.\n\nMoscow\u2019s total forces are much larger \u2014 around a million active-duty personnel \u2014 and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.\n\n\u2013 High cost of war \u2013\n\nBut Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.\n\nShelling had intensified in recent days between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists \u2014 a Ukrainian soldier was killed on Wednesday, the sixth in four days \u2014 and civilians living near the front were fearful.\n\nDmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised the two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.\n\n\u201cShe said: \u2018Have you heard the news?\u2019. How could I have known? There\u2019s no electricity, never mind internet. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Russian village around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border, AFP reporters saw military equipment including rocket launchers, howitzers and fuel tanks mounted on trains stretching for hundreds of metres.\n\nRussia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.\n\nWashington Wednesday announced sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Germany had earlier effectively suspended by halting certification.\n\nAustralia, Britain, Japan and the European Union have all also announced sanctions.",

          "title": "Russian Military Vehicles Cross into Ukraine from Annexed Crimea",
          "text": "Security camera footage on Thursday shows a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Russian-annexed Crimea.\n\nRussian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d\n\nBig explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent.\n\nUkrainians started fleeing some cities, and the Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and air bases within hours.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault, while never knowing precisely when it would come, were urged to stay home and not to panic even as the country\u2019s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighboring Belarus.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy.\n\nPutin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.\n\nBiden in a written statement condemned the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified attack,\u201d and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d and said Ukraine will \u201cdefend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?\u201d 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin \u201cwill be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.\u201d\n\nThe Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia\u2019s massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that \u201cthere is no threat to civilian population.\u201d\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.\n\nAfter the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm.\n\nThe consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.\n\nAsian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.\n\nAnticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, \u201cwhoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.\u201d\n\nPutin urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d\n\nIn a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, Putin warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d He emphasized that Russia is \u201cone of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.\n\nPutin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that the White House said was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.\n\n\u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.\n\nIn an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said.\n\nHe challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: \u201cStop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.\u201d\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning \u201cRussia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.\n\n\u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d they said on Twitter.\n\nEven before Putin\u2019s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d\n\nThe threat of war has already shredded Ukraine\u2019s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.",

          "title": "Nigeria Airline Operators Deny Fixing Base Fare, Lament Loss of $60m to Bird Strikes, Flight Cancellations",
          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has denied fixing base fare for economy flight tickets at N50, 000 as travellers insisted that the sudden increase in fares suggested collusion by the association.\n\nThe operators also complained that in 2021, they lost $60 million (N24 billon) to bird strike alone. The amount was used to replace their aircraft engines destroyed by bird strike.\n\nIn addition, they said cancelled flights due to lack of lack of night landing facilities at some airports, known as sunset airports, cost them over N20 billion in 2021.\n\nHowever, indications showed that air travellers have started shunning the airports as airlines have been recording low passenger traffic due to high fares.\n\nSpeaking during a media conference, in Lagos, on Wednesday, the Vice President of AON and Chairman/CEO of Air Peace, Allen Onyema said the N50, 000 ticket price had always been in the airlines\u2019 systems in the last five years, adding that airlines only adjust ticket cost based on their operational costs.\n\nOnyema said what the airlines did was to work out unit cost per seat, which he said determined their basic ticket price.\n\nOnyema who was representing the President of AON, pointed out that cost of aviation fuel was increased by over 200 per cent, with over 100 per cent depreciation in exchange rate in the last two years, while ground handling companies had increased their rates by over 300 per cent, yet cost of air ticket remained below $100.\n\n\u201cPeople have asked us how we maintain our planes with the fares we charge. In as much as we are rendering services, our business must be sustained. The repair of just one aircraft engine can take everything an airline makes in one month. Airline business is not a profitable business,\u201d Onyema added.\n\nHe said that no airline loves to delay flights but factors beyond the airlines\u2019 control cause flight delays.\n\nSome of the causes of flight delays he mentioned included bird strikes, airport apron congestion, lack of space for check-in of passengers, poor airport infrastructure, air traffic flow control, bad weather and unruly behavior of passengers.\n\nOnyema said that bird strike incidents in Nigeria was on the increase despite efforts by the Federal Airports of Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to stem it, thus forcing airlines to ground aircraft that should be operating and losing huge revenue.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the concerned authorities to provide airport equipment to help reduce bird strikes in Nigeria.\n\nThe AON said it strongly objected to the multiple designation granted foreign carriers such as Qatar Airways and Ethiopian Airlines by the federal government.\n\n\u201cDesignating foreign airlines to multiple airports in Nigeria impede growth of domestic airlines and the aviation sector. All foreign airlines put together do not provide 10 per cent of jobs provided by the smallest airline in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMultiple designation granted foreign airlines would lead to job losses and domestic airlines closing shops,\u201d Onyema added.\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY investigations have confirmed low turnout of passengers at the airports since Monday, following the hike in airfares to N50, 000.\n\nThis meant that one way tickets would cost over N50, 000 and might increase to N80, 000 to N90, 000 per ticket.\n\nThis was confirmed by some protocol personnel who spoke to THISDAY at the domestic wing of the Lagos airport.\n\nThey revealed that the increase in fares have reduced passenger traffic at the airport.\n\n\u201cYou have to know that the minimum ticket you can buy now is N50, 000. In the last two days I have sold tickets as high as N85, 000; some N75, 000 and some N70, 000. But the traffic is dropping fast. I am sure that if passenger traffic continues to drop, airlines will be forced to bring down their fares,\u201d the source who pleased to remain anonymous said.\n\nTHISDAY spoke to a passenger who travelled from Abuja to Lagos, on Wednesday, who disclosed that many of the seats in the aircraft that brought him to Lagos were empty.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at that time of the day, first flight from Abuja there was so many empty seats. The airlines have to understand that there is no money in this country. It is the middle class that flies. If they shun air travel the money bags cannot sustain their operations,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman of one of the major airlines confirmed to THISDAY that passenger traffic has dropped and he was worried that it would drop further.\n\nChinedu Eze",

          "text": "Multinational oil and gas companies, Shell and Total Energies, have stressed the need for the Nigerian government to provide some incentives to attract more investors into the nation\u2019s gas sector.\n\nThe international oil companies (IOCs) specifically called for an amendment in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to provide more clarity and better fiscal terms for Deepwater gas investments, insisting that more clarity on gas marketing terms would help to attract more investors into the gas space.\n\nThe Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Alboni and the Deputy Managing Director, Total Energies Deepwater, Mr. Victor Bandele, jointly opined that such incentives were needed now that the country is moving aggressively towards gas, having chosen gas as Nigeria\u2019s transition fuel.\n\nThey spoke at a panel at the ongoing sixth edition of Sub-Saharan African Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (SAIPEC 2022) with the theme: \u201cFostering Collaboration to Create Cross Border Partnerships across the Oil, Gas and Energy Spectrum\u201d.\n\nThe topic of the panel session was: \u201cIOCs: Dynamics of Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s Energy, Oil, Gas Industry, as We Strive to Low Carbon Future.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on how the PIA would impact investment in low carbon economy in Nigeria, Bandele said, \u201cSo, there is a drive for gas. We are still asking for the terms of the gas, the terms for the marketing part of the gas, to be such that it would be extremely attractive for the investors.\n\n\u201cBut when you look at the Act itself, it has brought a lot of clarity to the fiscal terms. So, all the investors can now come in and look at the terms and decide whether it is comfortable, that they feel good about it, and want to invest in this country.\n\n\u201cI think that the area that is silent in the Act that I want to really point out is the one around, if one has a solution, that you can actually approach government with the solution and get incentives from government.\n\n\u201cSo, this is something that is not so obvious. But I think they tried to as much as possible bring that out. I think in the coming years or coming months, we would see clarity on how we can move forward on new projects that will be attractive to the investor, and that will be very good for the country itself.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that the PIA brought clarity as to where government wants to drive the industry to, adding that most of the government\u2019s aspirations and initiatives being pushed on gas were all expressed in the legislation.\n\nOn her part, Alboni, who was represented at the panel by the General Manager, Business Development and Government Relations, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Bashir Bello, said issues around Deepwater gas provisions in the PIA need to be reviewed to bring in better fiscal terms.\n\nShe explained that the review of the PIA for a better fiscal terms for gas investment would allow investors to support government efforts in achieving low carbon economy and increasing gas production.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "title": "Nigeria: Buhari to Sign Reworked Electoral Bill on Friday",
          "text": "Barring any last minute changes, President Muhammadu Buhari may assent to the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him last month by the National Assembly, on Friday.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, on Wednesday, confirmed to THISDAY that the signing of the bill was on Buhari\u2019s schedule for Friday.\n\nShehu said, \u201cYes, the president will sign on Friday, God willing. It\u2019s on his programme.\u201d\n\nAnother reliable presidency source had earlier confirmed that the president was scheduled to assent to the bill at the State House, Abuja, about noon on Friday.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported on Monday that the President was seeking assurances from the National Assembly leadership to amend clause 84 which barred political appointees from voting or being voted for in their party convention or congresses without first resigning from office. This was interpreted as an infringement of their constitutional right. The President was seeking assurances that the lawmakers would amend this clause to bring it in conformity with the constitution after he may have signed the bill. THISDAY checks indicate, those assurances may have been given.\n\nTop government officials, including the leadership of the legislative arm, namely President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, would witness the signing ceremony for the electoral bill.\n\nThe top presidency source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, stated that arrangements had been finalised for the president to sign the amendment bill into law Friday.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cAll these anxieties will disappear by Friday afternoon. He will be signing the bill around noon of that day. I believe he has taken his time so that the Electoral Act can be as unassailable as much as possible.\u201d\n\nPublic anxiety had mounted in the last few weeks over Buhari\u2019s delay in assenting to the re-amended bill, as some members of the public as well as critical stakeholders had concluded that he was deliberately withholding assent again.\n\nThe National Assembly transmitted the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 to Buhari on January 31, a second time, having reportedly revised the bill, which he had withheld his assent to for some noted reasons.\n\nThe president was yet to assent to the bill, more than 20 days after it was transmitted to him, though he constitutionally has a 30-day window till March 1, within which he is mandated to either assent or state reasons for not doing so.\n\nBuhari had first withheld his assent to the bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of the electoral process by political players as part of the reasons for his decision. He, however, gave some conditions for his assent, prompting the federal lawmakers to re-work the bill, which initially led to the emergence of two versions from the green and red chambers of the assembly.\n\nThereafter, the two chambers, in a conference committee, harmonised their position before transmitting the reworked bill to the president last month.\n\nMeanwhile, Benson, in a chat with journalists in Abuja, argued that the clause, which sought to act as a leveller, did not in any way undermine the rights of political appointees to hold office or participate in primaries or main elections. He said the timeframe given by the clause (three months) for appointees to resign from their positions before conventions or congresses was only meant to place every aspirant on the same pedestal, and not to stop them from contesting, as being alleged in some sections of the public.\n\nBenson stated, \u201cAssuming without conceding that, that\u2019s what it says in section 84(10) that appointees must resign three months before primaries or convention, let\u2019s say it\u2019s geared towards stopping political office holders from contesting, there\u2019s a section of the constitution, which says that you shall resign 30 days before the general elections. If that constitutional provision clashes with the Electoral Act, which supersedes?\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no need to even worry about that clause if that\u2019s the way they perceive it. But what we are trying to do is that for a convention or a congress, you have statutory delegates. But a governor will go and appoint 1,000 political appointees to participate in the congress, whom do you think will win? The governor will.\n\n\u201cSo, we are saying no, you can\u2019t do that. Let\u2019s have a fixed number, manageable number. Let\u2019s give a fair chance to you, you and you, and not to the stooge or the preferred candidate of the governor. So, that\u2019s what that clause is trying to prevent. It is not trying to prevent political office holders from running. And I said even if does prevent political office holders from running, there\u2019s a provision in the constitution that protects them.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Zoning Presidency to South Puts PDP in Quandary",
          "text": "The decision, Tuesday, by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country, might have put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a quandary for contemplating to leave its own ticket open and by implication, put the north at advantage.\n\nBut the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, on Wednesday, reinforced the PDP position, when he declared that the zoning of the presidency to the South by the ruling party posed no threat to the main opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHis reaction may however underscore a concern in the party even though he tried to put a brave face on it.\n\nUnfortunately for the PDP, the APC seems to be playing a rather smarter card, given the current mood of the nation, and especially, because while most of the governors in both parties wanted power to shift to the south of Nigeria, the governors, being life of the political parties, are consciously working to the answer.\n\nAlthough in the PDP, such leaders like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, are among those, who want the PDP ticket thrown open. The Southern PDP governors are also inclined to power shift.\n\nHowever, the possibility that the PDP too might still go South is high, because once the party had zoned its chairmanship to the North, it is only ideal that its presidential ticket is taken South, a situation that would further give the APC an advantage of southern votes.\n\nThis is not to dismiss the understanding alleged to have been reached by PDP leaders at the point of making Dr. Iyorchia Ayu the national chairman of party, that if the equation changed at the point of choosing a presidential candidate, the chairman would resign if interests clashed.\n\nInterestingly, and based on simple logic, many of the PDP governors knew that the APC would have an advantage in the south if the presidency was zoned to the south.\n\nBut the danger in this is that the party could lose the votes of some northern states as THISDAY had previously extrapolated, a development that could automatically put states like Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom in play for the APC that is fielding a Southern candidate.\n\nWhat this means is that with a Southern presidential candidate by the ruling APC and without a concurrent Southern presidential standard bearer in the PDP, those key oil-rich Southern states could be won by APC, while not losing much ground in the north.\n\nAnother factor that many are currently considering as likely to work in favour of the APC is the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso\u2019s national movement, otherwise known as the third force.\n\nThe movement could divide the PDP further as well as shave valuable votes from the PDP in the North. In other words, the advantage the PDP hopes to gain in the north by potentially fielding a Northerner might be significantly eroded by Kwankwaso\u2019s third force.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Mohammed, who spoke with journalists, shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the PDP would continue to strategise to rescue Nigeria from the present situation she has found herself.\n\nThe governor, who described Obasanjo as a man with a lot of wisdom and an elder statesman per excellence, said he had come to seek his opinion on some of the things going on in the party.\n\nHis words: \u201cTo me, the zoning of Presidency to the South by the APC is not a threat to the PDP, because each party is trying to strategise, to plan and organise. If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory or if we put it to the North, it will give us more electoral victory.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of things we are doing: the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing the past relationship with Obasanjo, Mohammed said the issue of PDP, was basically one of the reasons for his visit.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that Baba is non-partisan; we know he is an elder statesman per excellence. But, we are rebuilding our party to remove rancour, division and so on. So, we still need him, because his words of wisdom are always very useful.\n\n\u201cSo, I have come to sound his opinion on some of the things going on in the party; to close ranks and make sure that we provide Nigerians with the opportunity to rescue the country, from the present division going around, which we have found ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bauchi governor expressed optimism about his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket to contest the 2023 election.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo me, presidency is a consensus \u2013 a stakeholder and a statesmanship \u2013 it is responsibilities. Of course, every Nigerian should try to contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation.\n\n\u201cMore so, when leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure that, we bring everybody on board and should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement that are capable of dividing us further.\n\n\u201cNigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my expression, but about the country.\u201d\n\nObinna Chima and James Sowole in Abeokura",
