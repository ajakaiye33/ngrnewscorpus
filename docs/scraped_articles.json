          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nHealth experts have warned that smoking shisha is far more dangerous to health than smoking cigarettes.\n\nThe experts stressed that contrary to the belief held by many people that shisha is less harmful than cigarette, a puff of shisha contains more toxins than a cigarette.\n\nShisha is a form of tobacco smoking that has become fashionable in society, with manywho do not smoke cigarettes embracing it. It is considered a better alternative to cigarettes. It is also called hookah, waterpipe, or goza.\n\nAccording to news-medical.net \u2013 an online medical media site \u2013 the practice of smoking shisha involves burning charcoal in order to heat up a special preparation of tobacco (shisha) which often contains molasses, honey or flavourings.\n\nWhen the shisha is heated up, smoke is produced that bubbles down through a container of water and into a long hose-like tube, fitted with a mouthpiece.\n\nHowever, public health experts have warned that smoking shisha puts people at risk of the same health complications as cigarette smokers, if not more.\n\nA public health expert, Dr. Taiwo Obembe in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise said smoking Shisha is worse because the smoker is smoking unfiltered smoke, unlike cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIn cigarettes you have the filter within the cigarette so what the smoker is actually inhaling is filtered smoke but shisha does not have any filter, so what you are inhaling is the direct smoke, which is more disastrous and harmful to the human body,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to this, the World Health Organisation says that in a typical one-hour shisha smoking session, users may inhale 100 to 200 times the amount of smoke they would inhale from a single cigarette.\n\nAlso, WHO added that the smoke produced, even after it has been passed through water, contains high levels of toxic compounds which include carbon monoxide, heavy metals and cancer-causing chemicals.\n\nAlso, in a single water pipe session, users are exposed to up to nine times the carbon monoxide and 1.7 times the nicotine of a single cigarette.\n\nObembe, who is a public health specialist at the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, also pointed out that people who smoke shisha feel that it helps their social life.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who smoke it feel like they have psychological benefits attached to it.\n\n\u201cSome of them who use it claim that psychologically it makes them feel at home. They feel it helps them connect better with people socially.\n\n\u201cThey claim these to be the mental benefits but when it comes to health itself, there are no benefits attached to it,\u201d Obembe clarified.\n\nAlso speaking, a Professor of Public Health, Dr. Tanimola Akande in agreement said there is no practical health benefit in smoking shisha.\n\nRather, it could lead to other vices like drug and substance abuse by the users.\n\n\u201cOnce you go into that kind of thing, you are likely to go into others like alcohol and substance abuse. Some people get into it due to peer pressure; the same peer pressure will also push them into substance abuse.\u201d\n\nAkande, who is also a former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, added that, \u201cThe effects of shisha are even worse. The emissions from a puff of shisha are very toxic. Comparing it with cigarettes is worse. It leads people into more addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nThe health experts urged the government to play its part in discouraging the use and sale of shisha by imposing or raising the tax levels of such products.\n\nLike cigarettes, the health experts say the damages shisha does to the health are the same such as lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn addition to these, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said smoking shisha could lead to oral cancer, stomach cancer, decreased fertility, cancer of the oesophagus, reduced lung function and cardiovascular disease.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Deborah Tolu-Kolawole\n\nNo fewer than 221 out of the 11, 671 international inbound passengers tested positive for COVID-19 in three weeks.\n\nAlso, the rate of recovery among those infected with the virus dropped by 69.77 per cent within one week.\n\nVirologists, who spoke to The PUNCH on Sunday, described the figures as disturbing.\n\nThey particularly expressed concern about the sharp increase in the rate of COVID-19 positive cases among passengers coming into Nigeria.\n\nThe virologists, therefore, urged the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control to release more details about infections and the Delta variant.\n\nThey said the release of the details would go a long way in enlightening the public while drawing attention to the need to take non-pharmaceutical preventive measures more seriously.\n\nA report contained on the NCDC website accessed by The PUNCH on Sunday revealed that the number of inbound passengers who tested positive had spiked.\n\nA check on epidemic week 26(June 28 to July 4) revealed that only 14 out of the inbound passengers to Nigeria tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nIt was also discovered that in week 27(July 5 to July 11), the figures rose drastically as 81 passengers who presented themselves for testing and isolation tested positive.\n\nThe data also revealed that in week 28 (July 12 to July 18), no fewer than 107 inbound passengers tested positive making a total of 221 passengers in three weeks. This is against a total of 54 positive passengers in the last month.\n\nA total of 11, 671 inbound passengers submitted themselves for testing during the period under review.\n\nAn analysis of data accessed by The PUNCH revealed that no fewer than 10,000 inbound passengers were reported to have shunned testing and isolation.\n\nThe Chairman, Expert Review Committee on COVID-19, Professor Oyewale Tomori, in an interview with our correspondent, described the situation as alarming.\n\nTomori said, \u201cThis is worrisome and this is a big problem. Were the passengers positive before getting onboard or were they positive after getting into the country?\n\n\u201cFrom what I know, you have to test negative before you are allowed into the plane, so where did they get it from? I also think the NCDC needs to start sharing more details about the situation.\n\n\u201cThe index case of the Delta variant was said to have come in through an inbound flight, which country? Is the person a he or a she, has he or she infected anyone? Are there plans to trace the infected individuals? All these will help in monitoring the trends.\u201d\n\nAnother Virologist from the University of Ibadan, Professor David Olaleye also shared the same sentiment with Tomori. Olaleye however expressed concern over the number of inbound passengers who were said to have escaped testing and isolation.\n\nHe said \u201cOver 10,000 were said to have avoided testing and isolation which means at one point or the other they would have been in contact with the positive cases.\n\n\u201cThis is highly disturbing and if things are not well managed, cases could skyrocket and we will be in very big trouble.\u201d\n\nAlso, the number of positive cases within the past week (July 19 to July 24) was 1,363, the highest within the last three months.\n\nThe PUNCH also observed that on Friday, 23 July, the country equally recorded 317 cases.\n\nFour weeks ago (June 28 to July 4) 392 positive cases were recorded.\n\nFrom July 5 to July 11, a total of 693 positive cases were recorded.\n\nAn analysis of the data by our correspondent also revealed that no fewer than 966 cases were reported from July 12 to July 18.\n\nThe latest findings by The PUNCH however revealed that from July 19 to July 24, the country reported 1,363 cases.\n\nFurther analysis of the data also revealed that the recovery rate among infected persons lowered drastically by 69.77 per cent within one week.\n\nJuly 12 to July 18 recorded 966 cases with 258 recoveries while July 19 to July 24 recorded 1,363 cases with just 78 recoveries and 4 deaths.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\n\nDr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director-General (DG) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has said the contributions of Nigerians at home and abroad could positively impact the nation\u2019s economy to bring about peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe DG said this at a webinar to celebrate the National Diaspora Day on Sunday, in Abuja, organised by the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to commemorate its establishment and its achievements so far.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the event was themed: \u201d Diaspora Integration for National Peace and Development\u201d, which NiDCOM described as being anchored on the levers of peace that would accelerate Diaspora engagement for national growth and development.\n\nThe commission observed that no nation could succeed in an atmosphere anchored on insecurity, hatred and divisive tendencies.\n\nIn her contribution, Okonjo-Iweala applauded the Diaspora for their huge contributions to the nation\u2019s economy, citing in particular how their remittances had brought about development of the rural areas and the sustenance of the economy.\n\n\u201dLet me applaud fellow Nigerians in the Diaspora because they are contributing so much, in many ways; the remittance that the Diaspora send home is in millions of dollars which has contributed in sustaining our economy.\n\n\u201cIt helps people living in the rural areas to get resources to send their children to school, take care of their health, build and run businesses, but we can do more wherever we are in the Diaspora, for there\u2019s no place like home.\n\n\u201cSo, what we should be thinking of is how we can help to make things better wherever we are, be it in the village or the town to make things better at home, either through creating employment, business, a civil society organisation, or helping to support what the local government is trying to do.\n\n\u201cThis is what helps to create peace and I am not saying that is all of it, but the fact remains that there are so many young people who do not have jobs and the COVID-19 situation had made that worse with the lockdown.\n\n\u201cI think we should be thinking of what we can do to help improve the economic situation of people at home because that\u2019s what helps to bring peace.\n\n\u201cIf we did not have so many disoriented and disorganised unemployed youths , some of the activities that we see at home that are detrimental towards peace and security might not happen,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Amb. Zubairu Dada, the Minister for State for Foreign Affairs, stated that the Federal Government was willing to create an enabling environment that would encourage direct investment by the diaspora.\n\nDada added that Nigerians in the Diaspora had continuously shown great dedication, with their time, skills, talents, resources and global exposure, to the development of the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s event encapsulates the intention of Nigeria in high engagement with her diaspora, especially in these times when we badly need peace, if any development is ever to take place.\n\n\u201cThis celebration is also a networking event intended to showcase the achievements of Nigerians in the Diaspora, particularly our internationally acknowledged surgeons, educationists, world class athletes, engineers, lawyers and scientists, among others.\n\n\u201cMen and women who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers for their huge contribution to the peace and progress of their host countries and humanity in general.\n\n\u201cI wish to assure you that the federal government of Nigeria will provide an enabling environment, through policies and programmes tailored to support you and your wellbeing, and in turn encourage you to give back for the upliftment of your country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the government had taken a further step by approving and adopting the National Diaspora Policy 2021 and its Action Plan, for a more holistic approach to the nation\u2019s engagement with the diaspora.\n\nMrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Chairman/CEO of NIDCOM, noted that development could only thrive in a peaceful environment, hence the need for maximum cooperation to collaborate.\n\nShe urged the diaspora to collaborate with Nigeria, their country of origin, in sharing ideas , technology and others skills, that would promote her development.\n\nNAN reports that the National Diaspora Policy 2021 was unveiled by the NiDCOM Boss, Mr Franz Celestin, Chief of Mission, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Sir Chibuzor Ugochi of the Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, (NIDO UK-SOUTH).\n\n\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), will continue on Monday before a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanu was arrested on June 25 and extradited to Nigeria to face trial for alleged treason.\n\nAbubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), had said the IPOB leader was \u201cintercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services\u201d.\n\nBinta Nyako, judge presiding over Kanu\u2019s case, had ordered that he be remanded him in DSS\u2019 custody, pending the continuation of his trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHOW IT ALL BEGAN\n\nThe DSS had first arrested Kanu in October 2017.\n\nThe federal government on December 18, 2015, filed a six-count charge bordering on treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose originally charged along with Kanu were Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawuisi.\n\nHowever, on November 9, 2016, the charges were amended to 11 counts with the inclusion of treason and some other offences.\n\nIn the amended charges filed Chidiebere Onwudiwe, the national coordinator of IPOB, was added to the defendants, bringing the number of accused persons to four.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, Justice Nyako quashed six out of the 11 count charge. She held that the prosecution failed to show evidence that the defendants belonged to an \u201cillegal\u201d organisation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also held that claims by the prosecution that the defendants were improvising how to make explosive devices cannot hold water because there was no proof.

He has not even sought to hide his predilection for his ethnocentric agenda. People are sick and tired. When I say people, I am talking of people from the South. Buhari has enabled the fault lines of Nigeria to come out to the fore. He has divided the country more than ever before.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know anybody that will quarrel with the argument of 17 governors asking for the table to turn. It will be difficult because this is not 2015. We are talking of 2023 and people know that it was a big error, a grievous mistake to have voted for Buhari, even in the South-West. That is why they are pinning the blame on Bola Tinubu, that he sold the South-West down a river. And now, the mask has been removed and people now know that the man they said was the answer to the problems of Nigeria has proven almost irredeemably to be unqualified and incapable of steering Nigeria along a good course.\n\n\u201cThe feeling of the Southern governors is quite understandable. They are sick and tired of what Nigeria has become and they want a change. And those who are against the change, peaceful change, if they are not careful, will make violent change inevitable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I have news for them. If you are going to resist the transition that the Southern governors are honestly calling for, then the consequence might be cataclysmic and it might be the end of Nigeria as we know it because we are having a coalescence of interests between South-West, South-South and the South-East. And nobody thought of geopolitical zones when they were talking of alternating power between the North and the South, even though the North is no longer monolithic because we have the Benue people.\u201d\n\nHe added that the southern governors want a change that will favour the region.",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down.

Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it\u2019ll launch the pilot scheme of its digital currency on October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to TheCable, CBN revealed this during a private webinar with stakeholders on Thursday, July 22, 2021.\n\nThe apex bank announced earlier on June 10, 2021, that it would launch a pilot scheme for its digital currency before the end of the year.\n\nRakiya Mohammed, CBN Director of Information Technology, said, \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Director also revealed that the project tagged GIANT will run on the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.\n\nHyperledger Fabric blockchain\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is a private and permissioned blockchain network designed by computer hardware company, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The network is an open-source platform by the Linus foundation, which means several developers contributed to its code.\n\nThe blockchain network is built specifically for enterprise-grade applications. It is recommended for businesses or private entities hoping to keep transactions exclusive.\n\nSince it\u2019s a private network, the CBN decides who can enter the platform. The regulator can approve or override a transaction if it deems fit, unlike bitcoin, where transactions are approved upon the agreement of majority nodes.\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric has been criticised as not even being a blockchain network with less expensive solutions offering the same level of security.\n\nIn a Cointelegraph article on July 2, 2019, Stuart Popejoy, blockchain expert and founder of hybrid blockchain platform, Kedena, said that \u201cFabric\u2019s architecture is far more complex than any blockchain platform while also being less secure against tampering and attacks. You would think that a \u201cprivate\u201d blockchain would at least offer scalability and performance, but Fabric fails here as well. Simply put, pilots built on Fabric will face a complex and insecure deployment that won\u2019t be able to scale with their businesses.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, he says, blockchain is a decentralised and immutable platform where truth is enforced with a consensus mechanism.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTwitter\u2019s shiny new downvote button\n\nConvergence\u2019 Partners\u2019 $120m round\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\nTwitter is testing out a downvote button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nWhat happened? Micro-blogging platform, Twitter is testing a way to upvote or downvote replies as part of efforts to understand what users find relevant in a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Twitter says while the downvote button will be visible, only the reply owner can know the exact number received.\n\nFor now, it is a test for a research the company is conducting to see if the up and down voting match what it suggests as relevant replies. It is currently available to a few iOS users.\n\nHave we seen something similar? Platforms like Reddit and YouTube have a downvote and dislike button, respectively.\n\nHowever, according to Twitter, this is not a dislike button and while it bears some resemblance to Reddit\u2019s downvote button, it will not affect the order of replies. This means they will not be ranked according to the highest numbe of downvotes.\n\nWait a minute, how will this improve interaction on Twitter? Will it reduce toxic tweets? Won\u2019t this encourage trolls especially since only the recipient can see it?\n\nWell, I found Ashton Kutcher, actor and tech investor\u2019s comments on a \u201cdislike button\u201d quite interesting.\n\nPer CNET, Kutcher believes a dislike button will head off more volatile expressions of disagreement on social media platforms, giving people a simple, frictionless way to give negative feedback.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat inclined to agree but I still have some reservations. I also wonder if there might be an option to turn this feature off if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, in May 2021, Jane Wachung Wong, an app researcher, revealed that Twitter was working on adding Facebook-like reactions \u2014 \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd14, \ud83d\ude13 \u2014 to the platform.\n\nWhat is Twitter going to spring on us next? Any ideas? Let me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanzanian shilling notes\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the necessary requirements.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means Cellulant is now one of the PSSPs supported by the Bank of Tanzania to offer digital payments solutions across the country.\n\nDo you know? Cellulant was founded in 2002 as a music streaming platform that enabled musicians to get a percentage of the money paid by fans to download their songs.\n\nThen over the years, the music streaming platform rebranded as a fintech company, offering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners.\n\nWith a physical presence in 18 African countries, the company boasts of offering more than 154 payment choices in 34 countries, and connecting 220 million users to a single inclusive network, enabling interoperability that has evaded multiple companies in the payments market.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant launched Trigg, a digital payments network, in Zambia, that enables companies around the country to seamlessly take payments from their customers.\n\nTrigg is said to help businesses wishing to digitise their payments to collect and make payments across many payment methods and currencies with the greatest customer experience.\n\nEdwin Kiiru, Tanzania\u2019s Cellulant Country Manager, says the approval by the BOT will enable the company to extend its payment solutions across all spectrums of Tanzania\u2019s payments ecosystem.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will allow it connect to banks, online merchants, payment processors, merchants, state governments, and customers to meet their digital payment demands in Tanzania.\n\nConvergence Partners raises $120 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African tech investment firm, Convergence Partners, has raised $120 million to drive inclusion in Africa.\n\nWho participated in the round? CDC Group the UK\u2019s development finance institution, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Proparco \u2014 private sector arm of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD Group) \u2014 participated in the round.\n\nWhat about Convergence Partners? Founded by Andile Ngcaba, CEO, in 2006, the investment firm is focused on the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) sector in Africa.\n\nAccording to the official website, the firm has invested in submarine cable systems, geostationary satellites, terrestrial long-haul, metro and access fibre, wireless networks, data centres, and service provision like enterprise connectivity, fintech and healthtech solutions, and data switching since its launch.\n\nIn February 2021, it acquired Ctrack, a telematics Software-as-a-Service (Saas) digital infrastructure platform that offers fleet management, insurance and weather telematic solutions and asset tracking solutions to its subscribers in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe new funding will be utilised to further digital infrastructure\u2019s emerging growth areas, particularly fibre, wireless, data centres, 5G, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), network virtualisation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, the funding when invested is aimed at boosting entrepreneurship, innovation, skills development, and creating jobs while increasing access to the Internet and all the critical digital tools it provides.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTwitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces.

Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "Dangote Cement\u2019s $1bn factory to start production in Edo State\n\nAfrica\u2019s leading cement manufacturer, Dangote Cement Plc, has said that its 6 million metric tonnes per annum factory in Edo State, at an estimated $1 billion is complete and set for commissioning.\n\nThe Dangote Group on April 10, 2016, started the construction of the $1 billion cement factory at Okpella Edo State to expand its cement production in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: The Week Ahead\n\nThe completion of the 6 million metric tonnes per annum Okpella plant and the 6 million metric tonnes per annum at Itori Ogun state is expected to increase the company\u2019s total local production capacity to 41.25 million metric tonnes per annum.\n\nThe disclosure is contained in a statement issued by Dangote Cement, saying that the plant which is sitting on a 1,000-hectare land, aligns with the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration\u2019s plan to diversify the state\u2019s economy and attract investment into its productive sector.\n\nThe director, stakeholder management at Dangote Cement Plc, revealed that the local community made an input in the construction of the plant as engineers, technicians and other members of the community worked on it till completion.\n\nHe was quoted as saying, \u201cIn Nigeria, we have a population of over 200 million people. The per capita consumption of cement in Nigeria is low. We still need to do more to make the cement get to the poorest of the poor.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the company pointed out that the plant was built by Sinoma International Engineering Company with 1,500 local workers collaborating with the Chinese engineers on the project.\n\nIt also added that the plant is expected to employ at least 6,000 workers when it commences operations.\n\nPoultry Association of Nigeria warns FG of 10 percent job losses\n\nThe Lagos Chapter of the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) has warned that Nigeria may likely witness 10 percent job losses if the immediate problems facing the sector including the rising cost of feed are not addressed by the federal government.\n\nThis was disclosed by PAN\u2019s Lagos chapter chairman, Godwin Egbebe, in Lagos on Thursday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nEgbebe stated that \u201cIf the growing price of poultry feed and a host of other challenges in the sector continue, 10 percent of Nigerians may lose their jobs as poultry farmers continue to shut down across the country. The situation on ground is that the poultry sector is actually at risk because of the growing prices of poultry feed.\n\nThe situation has caused a lot of poultry farmers to close shop because of the problems in the sector\u201d.\n\nEgegbe added that some farmers have called it quits and have started advertising to sell their cages off because they want to close their businesses, he urged the FG to take the problems in the poultry sector very seriously.\n\n\u201cIt is like they are not taking us serious the way they take the problems in the cattle sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe kind of employment that the poultry sector gives to Nigeria, the cattle sector cannot give such but the government is not taking the poultry sector seriously. We want the government to do all they can to intervene in the sector so that these poultry farms do not become grounded. This is because if they do, about 10 percent of the population will lose their jobs\u201d, he added.\n\nNBS economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics economy data release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\nMonday 26th July, 2021 \u2013 Crime Statistics: Reported Offences by Type and State (2020),\n\nThursday 29th July, 2021 \u2013 JAMB Admitted Candidates by State and Gender within Faculty (2020).\n\nGold trades below $1800 as COVID-19 cases decline in the U.S.\n\nGold was on a downtrend in the London trading sessions as investors increased their risk appetite due to bullish momentum from the U.S dollar bolstered by a decline in the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant.\n\nGold futures were down 0.37 percent, trading at $1,804.75 an ounce. Gold is down 1.33 percent from last week\u2019s high of $1,829 an ounce.\n\nThe dollar index, which usually moves inversely to gold, was up 0.04 percent, trading at 93.015, a trading zone it has not traded in the last 3 months. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields also bounced off five-month lows. Gold depreciated by -0.64 percent while Silver dipped by -1.83 percent week-on-week (W-o-W).\n\nGold prices are expected to dip in the coming week, amid a stronger dollar and rebounding yields.\n\nOil market\n\nThe OPEC+ ministers, on Sunday, agreed to boost oil supply monthly by 400,000 bpd from August 2021 to cool oil prices which have climbed to almost three years high as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates saw its baseline production increase to 3.5 million bpd from May 2022 from its present 3.168 million bpd. Saudi and Russia also saw an increase to 11.5 million bpd each from the current 11 million. Iraq and Kuwait got an increase of 150,000 bpd each.\n\nOil prices fell sharply on Monday after OPEC+ overcame the internal divisions and agreed to boost output, sparking concerns about a crude surplus as COVID-19 infections rise in many countries.\n\nOil fell further, on Friday, below $74 a barrel but on track to end the week largely unchanged after rebounding from a sharp drop on Monday, on the back of expectations that supply will remain tight as demand recovers. Brent had a weekly growth of 0.16 percent\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish on expectations of tighter supplies through 2021 as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCurrency market\n\nThe currency market was flat at the BDC market while it depreciated at the I & E Fx window on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis.\n\nIt remained flat against the US dollar at the BDC to close at US$/N500, against the British pound it appreciated by +0.70 percent to close at \u00a3/N705, and against the Euro by +0.83 percent to close at \u20ac/N595.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira depreciated W-o-W by -0.07 percent and -0.03 percent at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.50 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.11.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market\n\nFunding rates continued their single-digit trend last week, due to inflows of N49.4 billion and N37.6 billion from LDR and Repo facilities at the end of the week, hence, causing interbank rates to fall.\n\nHowever, at the close of the trading session on Friday, funding rates rose significantly. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 27.50 percent while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 28.75 percent indicating a W-o-W rise of +511.11 percent for OBB and +505.26 percent for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury bills market\n\nThe treasury bill market was quiet for most of the trading session last week.\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills increased by +3.14 percent to 6.90 percent while OMO bills fell more significantly by -7.75 percent W-o-W to close at 8.57 percent, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by 0.24 percent to close at 8.35 percent.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and eurobond market\n\nThe Bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as the bulk of the attention was skewed toward the Bond auction.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with selling interest seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.62 percent for the week which fell W-o-W by -0.70 percent.\n\nSuccessful bids for the 13.9800 percent FGN FEB 2028, 12.4000 percent FGN MAR 2036 & 12.9800 percent FGN MAR 2050 were allotted at the Marginal Rates of 12.3500 percent, 13.1500 percent, and 13.2500 percent, respectively.\n\nHowever, the original coupon rates of 13.9800 percent for the 13.9800 percent FGN FEB 2028, 12.4000 percent for the 12.4000 percent FGN MAR 2036, and 12.9800 percent for the 12.9800 percent FGN MAR 2050 will be maintained.\n\nActivity in the Eurobond market maintained its weak trend with minimal volumes traded across the board. Average benchmark yields dipped marginally by -0.18 percent to close at 5.54 percent on a W-o-W basis.\n\nWe expect the relatively quiet trend to persist in the near term.\n\nThe Nigerian capital market\n\nLast week was a brief trading week as the Federal Government of Nigeria declared Tuesday 20th and Wednesday 21st July 2021 as Public Holidays to commemorate the Eid el-Kabir celebration.\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a positive note with some cherry picking and bargain hunting. The NGXASI closed the week on a negative note with a growth of +1.90 percent.\n\nThe Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N375.50bn, year-to-date return moderated to -3.98 percent, while the market capitalization settled at N20.15 trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange this week advanced by +13.36 percent and +34.04 percent respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was broadly positive this week as the NGX Oil and Gas was the highest gainer for the week with +7.53 percent while NGX Insurance recorded the highest decline with -0.74 percent.\n\nNGX IND, NGX-30, NGX Consumer Goods, and NGX Banking closed the week with +4.06 percent, +1.94 percent, +0.57 percent and +0.44 percent respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 43 gainers led by CUTIX and TOTAL as against 16 losers led by SMURFIT and SOVRENINS.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments is likely to impact investors decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nThe Nigerian economy in retrospect\n\nIn its recent report titled: \u2018Of Roads Less Travelled: Assessing the Potential for Migration to Provide Overseas Jobs for Nigeria\u2019s Youth\u2019, the World Bank noted that Nigeria is experiencing its worst unemployment crisis as the unemployment rate rose five-fold, from 6.4 percent in 2010 to 33.3 percent in 2020. The report identified the two recessions suffered by the economy has resulted in high unemployment rates in the country forcing many to seek refugee status in other countries.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated a 15-member Board of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the President stated that the NEITI is essential for achieving the country\u2019s economic goals, while at the same time ensuring transparency in the management of the nation\u2019s natural resources as well as in oil, gas, and mining industries.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), POS transactions in Nigeria increased to N3.01 trillion in 462.11million transactions as of June 2021, this represents a +50 percent increase compared to the N2.03trn recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. In comparison to the value of POS transactions in H2 2020, the current figure (N2.72 trillion) represents a +10.3 percent increase.\n\nAccording to the Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a -20 percent reduction in annual diaspora remittances from $25bn to $20bn in 2020. The Chairman disclosed that several programmes are being undertaken by the government to shore up the deficit.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank had earlier said remittances by Nigerians in the Diaspora fell by -27.7 percent from $21.45bn in 2019 to $15.5bn in 2020. Remittances represent over 83 percent of the national budget and 6.1 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.\n\nThe Central bank of Nigeria has announced October 1 as the date for the launch of the E-Naira, in a webinar with the fintech community the CBN noted that the digital currency would promote cross border trade, the efficiency of monetary policy, financial inclusion and targeted social intervention.\n\nThe price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, also known as cooking gas, has surged by +60 percent to a record high of N500 per kilogramme, on the back of the devaluation1 of the naira and lingering inadequate domestic supply of the fuel.\n\nIn addition to unemployment and an already high poverty level, increases in prices of essential products such as LPG is bound to increase the country\u2019s misery index.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nDespite oil prices rising above $70/barrel, optimism about greater fiscal space is being dampened by the emergence of the new strand of covid 19 virus questioning once again the revenue diversification efforts of the government.\n\nAsides from oil proceeds, the government plans to fund critical infrastructure by raising the tax rate but economists recommend as a counter-cyclical policy that the government embarks on a large-scale public-private partnership.\n\nThe MPC meeting scheduled for next week would likely see the MPC hold parameters given that recent inflation figure (17.75%) suggests that prices would continue to fall although it is expected to still remain high.\n\nThe MPC would also consider positive developments in the external sector as current account deficits reduced in June to less than 2 percent of GDP from 3 percent GDP last year.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s long journey to a consolidated democracy where there will be credible and transparent elections appears to be under threat.\n\nIt would appear that elected representatives of the people who have found themselves in leadership position at the National Assembly are putting the gavel to use in a negative way, defeating the main essence of the instrument.\n\nThe rush with which the presiding officers at the Senate and the House of Representatives chant \u201cthe \u2018ayes\u2019 have it\u201d or \u201cthe \u2018nays\u2019 have it\u201d appears to suggest that in many occasions they do not even hear correctly what is being said. Their chants and hitting of the gavel depend on what they want to achieve in any circumstance.\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy\n\nThey always have their way, to the detriment of the entire country, as the hitting of the gavel signals the conclusion of a matter on the floor of the house.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, a gavel is a small ceremonial mallet commonly made of hardwood, typically fashioned with a handle. It can be used to call for attention or to punctuate rulings and proclamations and is a symbol of the authority and right to act officially in the capacity of a presiding officer.\n\nIt is often struck against a sound block, a striking surface typically also made of hardwood, to enhance its sound qualities.\n\nWikipedia noted that, according to tradition, Vice President John Adams used a gavel as a call to order in the first U.S. Senate in New York in the spring of 1789. Since then, it has remained customary to tap the gavel against a lectern or desk to indicate the opening and closing of proceedings and to indicate that the judge\u2019s decision is final. It is also used to keep the meeting itself calm and orderly.\n\nApart from the listed noble uses of the gavel, it would seem that the use of the instrument has been politicised in Nigeria, as presiding officers now allegedly employ it to achieve pre-determined outcome.\n\nNigeria and the world might have watched with amazement as Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives and Chairman of Committee of the Whole in the House, Ahmed Idris Wase recently hit the gavel twice to uphold the fainted voice votes of the anti-electronic transmission of election results proponents as against the thunderous votes of the pro-electronic transmission lawmakers during consideration of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nIt is believed that electronic transmission of election results and adoption of technologies in the electoral process is panacea to manipulation of polls results which has been the bane of democracy in Nigeria in the past 22 years of the country\u2019s democratic journey.\n\nRead Also: Udom wants quick passage of electoral bill to restore confidence in Nigeria\u2019s democracy\n\nCritical stakeholders, including the electoral body; the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Development Partners have always advocated for electronic conduct of elections to check all forms of malpractices common with manual operations.\n\nThe clamour and expectations of the stakeholders and indeed Nigerians were that the recently passed Electoral Act Amendment Bill will give legal backing particularly to electronic transmission of election results and voting.\n\nHowever, the new Act in section 52 leaves the electronic transmission of election results at the mercy of INEC, which can decide when and where to transmit votes electronically or manually.\n\nSection 52 (2) of the Bill provides that: \u201cThe Commission (INEC) may adopt electronic voting or any other method of voting in any election it conducts as it may deem fit.\u201d\n\nThe Committee on Electoral Matters explained that the provision \u201cis a further amendment of the 2015 Amendment to clearly give the Commission the discretion to introduce electronic voting as may be practicable\u201d.\n\nAll was going well during the clause-by-clause consideration of the report on Electoral Bill with members proposing and adopting amendments where necessary from clause 1-51, when all of a sudden, conviviality turned into acrimony when Clause 52, section of the Bill which deals with electronic transmission of election results was read out by the Deputy Speaker who presided over the consideration.\n\nOut of the cacophony of voices calling for amendments to the clause was the Deputy Minority leader of the House, Toby Okechukwu who proposed that electronic transmission of election results be inserted and made compulsory in the Bill.\n\nOkechukwu moved that Clause 52 (2) be amended to read that: \u201cVoting and transmission of results shall be by electronic transmission\u201d.\n\nHis motion for the amendment was seconded by the Deputy Chief Whip of the House, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia) and it was subjected to a voice vote by Wase.\n\nWhen it was put to voice vote, the motion received a deafening \u201cayes\u201d but Wase ruled that the shallow \u201cnays\u201d shouts had it, throwing the House into disarray with protesting lawmakers making awkward movements.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker did not hide his opposition to electronic transmission of votes when he argued that the entire country was not yet covered by broadband and as such, there would be issues with electronic transmission of results.\n\nHe wondered how electronic transmission of results would be practicable in parts of the North East where telecommunications masts have been destroyed by the Boko Haram terrorists, saying: \u201cConsider what happens to our brothers in Yobe and other places.\u201d\n\nAnother attempt by James Faleke (APC, Lagos) to at least have both the electronic and manual transmission of election results via a motion seconded by Wale Raji (APC, Lagos) was resisted by Wase who hit the gavel in favour of the \u201cnays\u201d even when it was abundantly clear that the \u201cayes\u201d had it.\n\nEfforts to divide the House for members to cast individual votes on the electronic transmission of elections results were thwarted as the leadership reverted the House to plenary and adjourned proceedings for the day.\n\nThe Green Chamber had also summoned the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to guide it on the issue of electronic transmission and NCC declared that only 50percent Polling Units across the country have 3G network that can enable such transmission.\n\nThis gave the All Progressives Congress (APC)-dominated House teeth to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill without explicit provision for electronic transmission of votes except for the controversial section 52(2) which makes it optional.\n\nThe House\u2019s action was without recourse to INEC which is actually the body saddled with the responsibility of conducting elections and not NCC.\n\nThe Commission had shortly after the passage of the Bill reiterated its earlier position on a National Television that it has the capacity for electronic transmission of results from remote areas of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have uploaded results from very remote areas, even from areas where you have to use human carriers to access,\u201d INEC\u2019s National Chairman and Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye said.\n\n\u201cSo, we have made our own position very clear, that we have the capacity and we have the will to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur powers are given by the constitution and the law, and we will continue to remain within the ambit and confines of the power granted to the commission by the constitution and the law,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nSolomon Bob, a member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the House, while speaking on a Channels Television breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily, on July 21, 2021 accused Wase of rigging a voice vote conducted during the debate.\n\nBob said that after the rejection of a motion by an APC lawmaker for outright removal of electronic transmission of election results from the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, Deputy House Minority Leader Toby Okechukwu moved a counter motion to amend Section 52 of the bill to read \u201ctransmission of election results shall be done electronically,\u201d a move which sought to make it compulsory for INEC to transmit election results through electronic means.\n\nHe said that although the supporters of the motion \u2013 the \u2018ayes\u2019 \u2013 were more and as such louder than those against, the \u2018nays,\u2019 the deputy speaker ruled in favour of the \u2018nays.\u2019\n\nGiving an account of what happened, Bob said, \u201cThe trigger to the sequence of events that occurred on Thursday was an attempt by a member who moved a motion that we should not have anything at all to do with electronic transmission, which is ridiculous.\n\n\u201cHe said we should be stuck with manual transmission which was the position of the ruling APC. The motion was roundly defeated.\n\n\u201cAnother motion was moved, contrary to that earlier one moved by the APC member, that we should have it explicitly stated that results will only be by electronic transmission. Some said \u2018no\u2019 while some supported the motion. A voice vote was taken, it was against those who were against it. It was in favour of those who said it should be explicitly stated in the law that transmission will only be by electronic means.\n\n\u201cBut we also saw a capricious use of the gavel by the presiding officer \u2013 the chairman of the whole, the deputy speaker. He ruled against the \u2018ayes\u2019 even though it was clear that the \u2018ayes\u2019 had won it.\u201d\n\nThe motion was put to a second vote. The \u2018ayes\u2019 had it again but again, the deputy speaker ruled against the \u2018ayes,\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was such an extraordinary and capricious use of the gavel. A motion for division was called, he ignored it. It was an extraordinary abuse of the position of a presiding officer.\n\n\u201cBy our rules, if there is a disagreement between \u2018ayes\u2019 and \u2018nays,\u2019 you divide the House. But he refused, he practically ignored it. He denied that there was no submission at all. That was the reason behind the pandemonium in the House because a lot of things were heated up, members nearly came to fisticuffs but it was due to the audacity and the daring unlawfulness of the action taken by the man presiding and the near absence of decorum on the part of those who didn\u2019t want anything to do with electronic transmission.\u201d\n\nWhat seems to prove that Wase was deliberate in the wrong use of the gavel as he presided over the final debates on the passage of the amendment bill on the Electoral Act, was the open celebration thereafter.\n\nA letter was said to have emanated from Wase\u2019s office, celebrating the north\u2019s uncommon feat on the passage of that bill and the Petroleum Industry Bill. One of his aides, reportedly wrote to lawmakers from the north: \u201cOn behalf of the Deputy Speaker, Rt. Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase and the Northern Caucus leader, Hon. Musa Sarki Adar, I am directed to write and formally congratulate and appreciate all the northern caucuses for standing firm through their wisdom and strength to ensure the Northern interest in both PIB and Electoral Act is adequately placed in a position of advantage. There is no doubt a house united will forever get whatever it wants, giving [sic] the advantage we have in size\u2026\u201d\n\nIn March this year, while presiding over the sitting of the House, Wase had shouted down Mark Terseer Gbillah, representing Gwer East/Gwer West Federal Constituency, Benue State from presenting a petition on behalf of a group of Nigerians in the Diaspora over herdsmen\u2019s nefarious activities in Benue. Wase would not take that petition because the Nigerians who wrote and signed it were not resident in the country.\n\nThe wrong use of the gavel, which edged out electronic transmission of election results may have ruined Nigeria\u2019s democracy in no small measure as future exercise such as the 2023 general election is open to manipulations and other forms of electoral frauds experienced in the 2019 national polls and other off-season elections.\n\nThe 2019 elections were reported to have been characterised by high incidences of violence, manipulations, rigging, ballot box snatching, disruption at collation centres, vote buying and inconclusive polls which electronic means would have checked to a large extent.\n\nReports from local and international observer groups including the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), International Republican Institute (IRI) and National Democratic Institute (NDI), Civil Society Situation Room and Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) expressed serious reservations over the conduct of the 2019 general elections with regards to non-credibility.\n\nThe EU EOM\u2019s final report on the 2019 elections for instance, observed that lack of transparency and inconsistent numbers during the collation of results by INEC cast a long shadow over the integrity of the 2019 elections.\n\nThe report among others alleged that there were: \u201cnumerical discrepancies and anomalies on polling unit results forms were identified and were mostly corrected by collation officers on the spot, but without a clear system of record-keeping.\n\n\u201cInconsistent numbers during collation, lack of clear checks and explanations, and insufficient public information undermined the integrity of the elections. Similarly, there is a lack of disaggregated results by local government, ward or polling unit, which would allow for thorough checking of results\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room in its report lamented that the 2019 general elections did not meet the threshold for free, fair and credible elections.\n\nThe report indicated that:\u201dThere were differences between the number of accredited voters and the total number of votes cast in many Polling Units.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission operations fell short of its identified role.\n\nAs Idayat Hassan, director, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), argued the prohibition of transmission of votes electronically would yield ground for the manipulation of results in future election.\n\n\u201cAs long standing election monitors, CDD West Africa, have observed the chaos associated with manual elections collating, which are \u201coften messy, incoherent and susceptible to manipulations by individuals and political parties,\u201d Hassan stated.",

          "text": "In 2014, when Marriott International bought Protea Hotel Group, Jonah Ekpeyong, a sous-chef with Protea Hotel Oakwood Park, Lekki Lagos, was among the staff laid off by the hotel, which became self-managed.\n\nBut fortune smiled on him when a Nigerian billionaire employed him as a private chef in his sprawling home by the waterfront in Banana Island, Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nOn settling down in the new job, Ekpeyong was usually sad on seeing two dogs, which the employer spends more than his chef salary every month to feed and maintain.\n\nAs well, there has been news in the dailies and gossip on social media of many employers who sent their house-helps to jail for misplacing or stealing their jewelry boxes, which probably are filled with gold ornaments.\n\nAt a point in 2019, two Nigerian billionaires were competing with each other on who buys the most expensive cars for their children and wives on birthdays. The social media was particularly awash with Femi Otedola\u2019s car gifts to family members on such occasions.\n\nRead also: \u2018Our objective in Nigeria is to increase our hotel portfolio by 50 percent by 2025\u2019\n\nMoreover, a visit to Legend Hotel Lagos Airport, Curio Collection by Hilton will expose you to the many private jets that take off and land almost every 30 minutes at the Quits Aviation hanger at the Lagos airport.\n\nThese are among the many elements of affluence, which many Nigerians flaunt unabashedly in a country that is officially recognised as the poverty capital of the world.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a soothsayer to tell you how poor the country is because the data is there, the suffering is obvious and the super rich are more than before rubbing their wealth on the faces of the downtrodden.\n\nIn 2020, many argued the World Bank report that revealed that Nigeria had overtaken India as the World Poverty Capital, considering that India has the most people living in extreme poverty.\n\nBut with 43 percent of Nigerians (89 million people) living below the poverty line, while another 25 percent (53 million) are vulnerable, what other evidence do one need?\n\nAccording to Fidelia Onah, a PhD Economics and consultant to African Development Bank on SMEs, poverty is looming more than forecasted in Nigeria because the government has severally refused to heed to advice.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fight poverty without creating employment. If you recognise SMEs as the engine room of economic growth, while not supporting them with favourable policies, because these are the largest employer of labour after government,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that there is so much wealth out there that needs to be redistributed as done in the developed world to reduce the poverty gap.\n\n\u201cBut who will redistribute the wealth, this government that is insensitive to the masses plight, politicians that allocate resources to themselves and family members or civil servants who are laying the conduit for government functionaries to loot funds? She wondered.\n\nThe economist, however, noted that poverty is very high in Nigeria, but not as high as being quoted by international bodies because of the lack of information on the extremely huge informal sector of the economy, which according to her, is estimated at around 60 percent more of the current GDP figures.\n\nBut the poor are also making an effort to shake hands with the rich, who rain money amid lack, hence the high level of crime in the society today.\n\n\u201cYou stay in your cozy presidential office and turn blind eye to the plights of millions of unemployed graduates, that is why youths are helping themselves with kidnapping, banditry, internet fraud with Yahoo Boys becoming bolder among other vices, and some are making fortune and crossing from Ajegunle to Banana Island,\u201d Israel Ogunu, a Port Harcourt-based psychologist and NGO administrator, lamented.\n\nHe further noted that the implication of naira rain on Nigeria in the midst of abject poverty is obvious. \u201cThe youth are on the fast lane and want it now, now. They will join any group, do anything or even risk their lives to make money and be welcomed into the moneybags\u2019 club\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cEven my little boy wants to spray money on his mother when she is dancing. Everybody needs money to live a good life and that is why we need good governance to ensure equity in wealth distribution, welfare for all and jobs to keep people positively engaged.\u201d\n\nGoing professional, the psychologist said that you cannot give a security agent a gun to safeguard money or oil well when he is poor, as he will rather use it to help himself.\n\nSame, according to him, goes for the youth.\n\n\u201cSome of those who rain money are their mates; all they need to do is find out how and where to get their own money. Fraud is quadrupling, kidnapping worse now and robbery has taken an unimaginable trend all because the youths want to escape poverty,\u201d the psychologist explained.\n\nAccording to a report by SafeYouths, a global tracker of crime committed by youths, illicit drug trafficking is still among the most thriving illegal businesses in the world today and that operators look to poor countries to recruit youths into drug trafficking because of the promise of hard currency and good life.\n\nThe report, its sixth edition, which was presented on June 26, 2021 to commemorate the United Nations\u2019 International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking 2021, revealed that poverty is pushing more youths from Africa into drug trafficking and that half of the recruits from Africa are in prisons across the world for drug trafficking.\n\nMeryline Boash, director of the platform, urged governments across the developing world, especially Africa to give priority to youth empowerment, create employment opportunities and ensure good governance to woo foreign direct investments.\n\nTo redistribute wealth, Onah thinks that the Nigerian government only needs to be sincere with governance to ensure that everything is not politics, truly offer a favourable environment to SMEs, get serious with the fight against corruption, tax the super rich more and adopt world best practice in welfare for the masses.\n\n\u201cYou cannot close the poverty gap when inflation is rising every day, when the corrupt are getting away with their loot, when youths are seeing violence as a means to quick money. You have to stop all these to close the poverty gap,\u201d she concluded.",

The other day, I visited Adamawa State and Ogun State and it seem to me the security situation is in a way exaggerated. In most places, I feel safe. But the media coverage is often exaggerated and making matters worse.\n\n\u201cThe biggest concern for Korean companies is political stability. So, political stability is key for Korean companies to decide investment in Nigeria. We want to see continuous political stability in Nigeria and that is what I have seen here (Rivers).\u201d\n\nThe ambassador, who was accompanied by his wife and officials of Korean embassy, commended Governor Wike able leadership over the years.\n\n\u201cWe have seen enormous progress in Rivers state in terms of infrastructure. I salute your able leadership.\u201d\n\nYoung-Chae said Korea is seeking more economic cooperation with Rivers State and the rest of the country in the areas of construction, oil, gas, agriculture, fishery and even cosmetic, medicine, pharmaceutical products.\n\nHe declared his readiness to help Nigerian companies penetrate into Korean and East Asian markets which combined Gross Domestic Product now surpass that of Europe and North America respectively.\n\nHe commended the Peoples Democratic Party chairman in Rivers State, Ambassador Desmond Akawor for being a worthy ambassador of Nigeria to the Republic of Korea.\n\nIn his response, Governor Wike commended the Korean ambassador for his pragmatic and objective analysis of the security situation in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cLet me sincerely thank you for saying clearly that the issue of insecurity is being exaggerated. People pay the media to carry negative publicity against states. Nobody will deny the fact of the problem we are facing in the country today and also the world in general.\u201d\n\nThe governor disclosed that prior to the take off of the $10 Billion NLNG Train 7 project, he held meetings with the Managing Director of Daewoo and Saipem and they were quite satisfied with the level of security in the state.\n\n\u201cRivers State is one of the safest states in this country today. Get the security statistics from the Police, from the State Security Services, from the military, they will tell you so. When people say Rivers State is one of the most unsafe state, you then ask them where did you get your statistics from.\u201d\n\nHe further continued: \u201cYou and I know if there is insecurity today, NLNG Train 7 cannot take place, because that is one of the biggest investment in this country today, $10 Billion investment. Nobody can make that kind of investment to a state where there is so much insecurity.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the issue of unemployment, the governor explained that if the national economy is not stable, it will invariably affect the sub-nationals.\n\n\u201cIf the national economy is booming, then there is the tendency that the component units economy will also boom. So people who do not have idea of the economy will come up to say that there is so much unemployment in the state.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike expressed the willingness of Rivers State government to partner with the Republic of Korea in agriculture, technical education and medicine.\n\nThe governor observed that most countries are now depending less on oil as a major source of revenue. And for Rivers State to survive, he said the government is focusing on agriculture by establishing a cassava processing company.\n\nHe remarked that the State government is willing to provide all necessary documentation, land and give all the necessary waivers and incentives to Korean investors wishing to invest in agricultural sector in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we give you the concession for those private investors, even tax rebate as it may be.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: I\u2019ll quit Methodist Church if it accepts same sex marriage \u2013 Nigerian Bishop",
          "text": "The United Methodist Church (UMC), one of the largest mainline Protestant denominations, is entangled in internal conflict over same-sex marriage and the ordination of Lesbians, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) clerics. At the February 2019 general conference of the church in the USA, the leaders rejected moves to remove restrictions on LGBT clerics and same-sex marriages.\n\nInstead, delegates from across the world voted 438 to 384 to pass what was called the Traditional Plan, which maintains the church\u2019s rules. As the church prepares for the next general conference in 2022, centrists and liberals who favour LGBT inclusion are in conflict over the issue.\n\nThe conflict has also affected the unity of the church in Nigeria, whose headquarters is in Jalingo, Taraba State. While the head of the church in Nigeria believes the conflict is behind the crisis in the Nigerian branch, others locate the cause elsewhere\n\nIn this report, our reporter, Chuwang Dungs, listens to the Bishop of the UMC in Nigeria, John Wesley, and his former administrative assistant, Emmanuel Ande, who is a leader of a group opposed to the leadership of the bishop, as they make their cases.\n\nOn the background to the dispute over the gay issue and its effect on the church in Nigeria?\n\nWesley: For many years the LGBT community has been advocating for acceptance in the United Methodist Church, but the church has objected to that. In each of the annual general conferences, it has always been ruled that the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with the practice of Christianity. In 2016 when they were defeated, there was an uproar among the LGBT community. They came into the session of the general conference and disrupted the proceedings, forcing the presiding officer to stop at a certain point. We had to move out of the venue because they were rioting and protesting. Because of that, we calmed the situation by promising to look into the matter.\n\nIn 2019, a special session was called and the Council of Bishops set-up a 32 member committee which it called the Commission on Way Forward. There were LGBT community members and different interest groups in the commission. To the honour of God, the Council of Bishops nominated me as a member of the commission. We had a series of meetings in the U.S. and came out with a report and presented it at the special session. But in that special session again, all the plans to include the homosexuals or the progressives were defeated.\n\nThe United Methodist Church upheld that homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings and I also share the same position. Looking at Genesis chapter 2, a man was created and God felt he needed a suitor and he created a woman for him; not a fellow man. That has been my position.\n\nIn 2014, I was granted the opportunity to present a message in the U.S.during a meeting of the Council of Bishops. In that message, I preached about love because the argument by the homosexuals is that they are not being loved. So in the message I cited that the concept of love is like a flowing water, flowing in a room causing a lot of mess. I said that is what I saw in the United Methodist Church. So when I finished the message, some homosexuals or progressives asked why I should say that. They raised questions and I gave them answers with Biblical backing.\n\nAgain, when we went for another meeting of the Council of Bishops, we were worried about the entire scenario and we went to paragraph 161 of our Book of Discipline, which says we will continue to be in ministry with everybody regardless of their sex, be they homosexuals, and be they pagans or traditionalists. Whatever, we will be in ministry with them. Being in ministry means we cannot send people out of our church. Rather, we will worship with them and praise God together.\n\nSo the press in the United States of America came to me after that meeting and said: \u201cBishop, we heard you preached last time and now the Council of Bishops has affirmed that the church will continue to be in ministry with LGBT, would you continue to be in ministry with them?\u201d I said yes, I have been in ministry with them, I don\u2019t kick them out of my church and I will continue to accept them in the church. But the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings. So being in ministry does not mean accepting the practice of homosexuality, it simply means accepting them in the church to worship with them.\n\nSome groups in Nigeria, because they want to stain me, picked up that statement and said that I have accepted gay practice in the church. So I referred them to the Book of Discipline and I told them it was a collective decision because we don\u2019t want to segregate anyone out of the church; that was why we adopted that section of the Book of Discipline and that doesn\u2019t mean we have accepted the practice of homosexuality, these are two different issues.\n\nI tried to explain that to people but they went about campaigning that I am the one encouraging the issue of LGBT, whether to please their sponsors somewhere which I don\u2019t know. Of recent I had some press conferences, I had radio and video interviews where I made it clear that I will not accept the practice of homosexuality, I remain a traditionalist and I will continue to be a traditionalist.\n\nChristmas Covenant\n\nSometimes in February I came across a document written by a group that called itself Africa Voice of Unity and there were four persons from Nigeria that endorsed that document. Those four persons are Rev. Ande Emmanuel, Rev. Eunice, Pastor Ahmed and then Amos Davidson, who is the lay person among them. The remaining three are clergies. In the whole of Africa, the highest number came from Nigeria, so people started calling me from all over concerning the document. Because in point number 7 of the document, these people said they affirmed the teachings of Christmas Covenant.\n\nNow what is Christmas Covenant teaching? It is advocating for the regionalisation of the United Methodist Church. Why they are advocating for the regionalisation of the church is because the United Methodist Church is a collection of churches and at the apex of the church, at the general conference, each time we come together, petitions on homosexuality are defeated. So now the Christmas Covenant people are saying that the best way to handle things is the church should be regionalised so that when we go for the conference, the issue of homosexuality will be treated on regional basis.\n\nBecause the votes from Africa against homosexuality come in bulk and that helps other traditionalist in the US to defeat the LGBT community. So what they are trying to do now is to regionalise the church and when the church is regionalised, you can go to your region and do whatever you want to do and that is to allow the practice of same sex. I said no to that because the United Methodist Church is one church, you cannot say a member should be allowed to practice homosexuality in the US and you come to Africa and say no to the practice. I said this is a double standard and there is no honesty in that. We can\u2019t have a divided theology, using the same scripture. I said I cannot do it and I continue to stand in their way.\n\nIn one of the petitions the Christmas Covenant is taking to the general conference for consideration, they removed paragraph 340, 341 of our Book of Discipline. Paragraph 340 is saying homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings and that money from the United Methodist Church cannot be used for wedding or any other ceremony related to LGBT. They said those paragraphs should be removed in our Book of Discipline. Now when you advocate for the incompatible language in our Book of Discipline, what are you standing for? You are simply a promoter of homosexuality and I said no, I cannot belong to that group.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo when I got that document, I called the leaders of the United Methodist Church Conferences in Nigeria and we met in Karim Lamido, Taraba State and I told them this is what some of us have done. They have written to other Bishops but refused to give me a copy. But another Bishop somewhere sent a copy to another lay person and that lay person sent it to another lay person in Nigeria and that was how I got a copy. I explained to the leaders, I have been conducting the annual conferences in Nigeria for many years. In each annual conference we have always maintained our position that homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings, so I am not doing anything outside what the United Methodist Church in Nigeria is asking me to do. I am doing what the United Methodist Church in Nigeria stands for.pp\n\nSo when I explained that, Emmanuel Ande and his group felt offended and said the meeting I held with the church leaders in Karim was unconstitutional and they went round saying all sorts of things, making publications and even wrote letters abroad. I called them and explained things to them and made it very clear to them that I am the presiding bishop of the annual conferences in Nigeria and each conference has affirmed that homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings, therefore, I said even if the entire church in Nigeria will endorse homosexuality, I as a person will not continue to be in the United Methodist Church; I will leave the church even if it will cost me losing my seat as a bishop. I will leave because I won\u2019t preside over a church that will condone the practice of homosexuality. This is my position and I maintain that.\n\nCome 2022 general conference, if the United Methodist Church endorses the practice of homosexuality, I will leave the church. This is my position and I will not change it. I will continue to retain it and I will continue to say it anywhere I go. And I am not saying it out of pride or because I am sinless. No. Romans 3:23 says \u201cFor all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God\u201d. I consider myself a sinner, but I am talking about what God said in Genesis chapter 2; that marriage should be between a man and a woman, not a man and a man or a woman and a woman. Therefore, it is not an issue of being righteous. So when I called for those meetings they became angry.\n\nApart from the plan by Christmas Covenant, there are also proposals for an emerging denomination. One of those is the Protocol Plan. The Protocol Plan is saying because of this irreconcilable difficulty, the whole church will be separated, which will give birth to an emerging denomination and that emerging denomination will not practice homosexuality. And some people are proposing Global Methodist Church (GMC) but we are not sure of the name which will only be known after the general conference in 2022.\n\nThey said I have exited the United Methodist Church because of my position against homosexuality. Look at me sitting here in the office, I am still the Bishop, how can I ask people to join GMC that is not in existence? What are they saying, am I a GMC bishop? Is there any church called GMC in Nigeria? I cannot understand what people are saying. These are some of the few issues causing the problems here and there.\n\nOn the division in the church in Nigeria\n\nWesley: In the United Methodist Church, there are so many groups with different motives and intents. But since they cannot make it public and they cannot express it, you can intelligently read what is going on? They themselves cannot voice it but they are doing it. For instance, when you say you will remain in the United Methodist Church and you don\u2019t care about what is happening in America, let them do their own thing, is that Christianity? Is that what Christ has asked us to do, not to be mindful of one another?\n\nIt is all about a desperate need for leadership. There is one magazine called Wax. In that magazine, one of them said he is vying for the position of the Bishop and that he is being called by people. These are some of the things causing all the problems, desperation for leadership.\n\nOne of the accusations against me is that I have picked up my friend and I want to make him the next bishop of the church and I am not supporting them because they ganged up against me. And all those who have ganged up against me are people that I have relieved from one position or the other. Go and check their records. They are angry, so they are doing all these. People like Nicodemus. Some people approached me saying that I must make him the youth leader. I said no, I have given him a position as leader of ILI, an international organisation in the church that supports the training of young people in the church. I always asked him \u201cwhere is that organization?\u201d No answer. I gave him free hands, so I cannot entrust him with leadership again.\n\nI told the team that came to me \u2013 Ahmed, because he was the youth director in the central, I assigned him somewhere, he was angry. My former administrative assistant, Emmanuel Ande, because I removed him from here they are angry. These are some of the things. Go to them one after the other. Because they are aggrieved of being relieved from one position or the other or because they are desperate to get another leadership role they are doing all these to create division in the church.\n\nAnd I am very sure they are receiving support somewhere. Where they are receiving the support that I don\u2019t know. If they are not receiving support somewhere where are they getting the money to host meetings? More often, they travel to different places. There must be sponsors and they know them. Like I said earlier, if you are saying you support the Christmas Covenant and it is saying regionalise the church, by implication you want the church divided.\n\nOn his support base in the church regarding his position on LGBT issue\n\nGod is my support base. When God is the basis of my support I work stronger because He is everything. What was the resolution of our annual conferences? It was clear that homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings and if the whole annual conferences are in support of my position, it shows I have the support of the church in Nigeria. And I still maintain that if the whole of United Methodist Church will endorse homosexuality, I will quit the church and I am not going to force anybody, everyone is at liberty to choose where to belong.\n\nOn government intervention to end the crisis in Nigeria.\n\nMany interventions by the government, in fact I want you to pursue the last committee that was set by the governor (Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku), headed by the CAN chairman. The meeting comprises Innocent Solomon, the former CAN chairman, the present Anglican bishop, the former Lutheran bishop and then CRCN president. They asked me all that they needed to know and I gave them all the answers with documents supporting my submissions. They promised to submit their report, which I believe they did. The governor promised one month but it is now getting to two years and there is no call, nothing. If the government hadn\u2019t gotten the report they would have asked because they gave one month. Why is the government silent? There are many things when we say people tend to react differently and as a leader of the church, if I don\u2019t say it who then will talk?\n\nOn the church and politics\n\nWesley: Some people are mortgaging the United Methodist Church for politics. Let me tell you the reality. The United Methodist Church is being used as a stool for political achievements for some people and so they are sustaining the crisis to continue to meet their political goals, because having the unity of the church will mean a very strong Christian community in the state.\n\nAnd I tell you, there are people in the Christian community that are working round the clock to ensure that there is no peace in the church. And if they are yearning for peace what are they doing?\n\nTake CAN for example, of which the United Methodist Church is a member. TEKAN wrote to the Taraba State government, wrote to CAN that Micah faction does not belong to TEKAN, therefore, they should not be given responsibility in CAN. But do you know what CAN Taraba State did? They ignored the letter. As I speak to you Micah remains ECWA/TEKAN president and we are the ones paying TEKAN dues, we are the recognised body in TEKAN.\n\nAfter telling you all these you will hear stories that the bishop is accusing CAN. But I am telling you the reality. If I don\u2019t say it, who will say it? If CAN as a body that is supposed to lead the Christians is not willing to tell the Micah group that you don\u2019t belong here, because of reasons best known to them, then something is wrong. I am not being given an invitation for CAN meetings because they recognise Micah against the position of the church and that of TEKAN, which is the fellowship of all churches under the defunct Sudan United Mission (SUM). There are so many complexities. Don\u2019t forget the United Methodist Church produced the first civilian governor in the state, and he was an ordained clergy of the church in the person of Jolly Nyame.\n\nMy friend, people are afraid of the United Methodist Church coming together. So this division is being sponsored by those benefiting from the situation. I once asked the governor that, when you contested and won, late Aisha of blessed memory took you to court and the court upheld your victory, and I asked him, can Aisha set up a parallel government in Taraba State? And he got angry with me that I was insulting him and that I am comparing myself with him. And that is not true, I was only trying to make him understand the scenario but he wasn\u2019t willing.\n\nOur largest denomination in Jalingo, the government shut it down for over four years just to deny me access. The government said there was rioting, people are coming to fight. That is to say the Taraba government is incapable of securing the lives and properties of the people. If the state is capable, why can\u2019t you stop rioters or people who illegally want to stop a right system on ground? And when we talk, people accuse us of being against the government, which I am not. I only want the government to do the right thing.\n\nWe elected him as governor, but some people for cheap political blackmail said I didn\u2019t vote for him and they are busy using that against me. The unit where I voted is in the name of my father, Angwan Isa, let them check the result of the unit and see the number of votes he got. Yet because of blackmail they are making all sorts of noise. However, is he not supposed to be a governor to all Tarabians and those living in the state irrespective of religious, ethnic or political affiliation? Let him do the right thing; that\u2019s my appeal to the governor.\n\nOn the way forward\n\nWesley: I am calling on all members to uphold the resolution of the United Methodist Church in Nigeria and the resolution is that homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teachings, be it in the U.S., be it in Asia, Europe, in Africa, in fact the entire globe. Let\u2019s do the right thing. That is my call to the church. I also want to call on my fellow clergymen in the church to see ourselves as servants called by God to lead His people, to be stewards and faithful to his words and also to work as a team in unity, respecting one another. I am calling on all Christians, not only members of the United Methodist Church, to see this problem happening in the church from a scriptural basis.\n\nEmmanuel Ande: Christmas Covenant has no connection with homosexuality\n\nOn Christmas Covenant and homosexuality\n\nAnde: Christmas Covenant has nothing to do with the issue of homosexuality. Anybody that told you that Christmas Covenant has anything to do with homosexuality, that person is misleading you. There is nowhere in the document that shows that Christmas Covenant is in support of homosexuality. Those are fabricated lies that people brought in to lure and mislead people that are ignorant and those that cannot read very well. Christmas Covenant is only one of the legislations that is going to be submitted to the general conference, it does not have anything in it that has to do with homosexuality.\n\nThe Christmas Covenant is a proposal. Like when you go to a parliamentary sitting of any assembly, you make a proposal. The Christmas Covenant is a document which is proposing the decentralisation of the church. Like in Africa we have what is called a central conference, and the proposal is suggesting a name change. And in the US from jurisdictional conference to central conference. That is all the Christmas Covenant is agitating for, it has nothing to do with homosexuality or whatsoever.\n\nAs Africans, we totally believe that homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teachings and as Nigerians, our constitution frowns at it. So there is nothing like that and there is none of our members from the United Methodist Church in Nigeria that is supporting or promoting homosexuality. Our position up to date in the Book of Discipline is homosexuality is incompatible with Biblical teachings.\n\nWe are asking for autonomy to decide our own theology. We want to decentralise the church in terms of teaching, worship and theology, and in terms of understanding the Bible. So we Africans are saying nobody can force us to accept homosexuality. So if Americans are saying they will do that, we are capable of maintaining our own position.\n\nReasons for the conflict.\n\nAnde: The major reason for the conflict is leadership. People are vying for leadership, some people want extension in their leadership, they want to remain in office till they die, they want to maintain positions where they will get and control resources. That is all. Any spiritual Christian will not go about fabricating lies for selfish gains. They are desperate for leadership. That is why they want to create a new church within the United Methodist Church.\n\nWe are the United Methodist Church in Nigeria and our position is that we will not go to any other church, we will maintain our position in the church as Africans. Those people propagating these lies are people that are creating a new denomination out of the United Methodist Church in Nigeria. They want to go to a denomination that is called Global Methodist Church, they have made alliance with some white people in the U.S. We don\u2019t depend on white people. We believe that we can be on our own, we can be self-governing, we can be self-propagating and this is what Christmas Covenant is talking about.\n\nOn allegation of ganging up against the Bishop\n\nAnde: It is not true that we ganged up against the Bishop because we were relieved of our positions as being insinuated by the bishop. I was relieved of my position as administrative assistant to the bishop on the 23rd of April 2021 and this issue has been going on since January, so how is that related to that? The first complaint they brought against me was written in March when I was still the administrative assistant to the bishop. So, this is just an excuse.\n\nWhy he was relieved of my position\n\nAnde: The bishop just relieved me of my position because I told him the truth. And what was the truth? I told him we are not going out of the United Methodist Church. He wants us to agree with him because he has signed and he wanted us to follow him but we said no. I told him clearly and openly that I am not going to be part of the Global Methodist Church in which he has made up his mind to join. That was the reason for my removal and everybody can attest to that.\n\nOn if the church decides to adopt homosexuality at its next general conference in 2022.\n\nAnde: If the Americans decide to do it, that\u2019s their problem. But there is no legislation that is coming to the general conference to call for adoption of homosexuality, they are just telling that to people that don\u2019t know.\n\nThe Christmas Covenant has nothing to do with homosexuality. As Nigerians we are talking about ourselves, we don\u2019t have control over Americans. Even what they are doing today, do we have control over them? We don\u2019t. So they are living in their own nation and we are also living in our own nation. What we are asking for is autonomy to worship our God the way we want to, not to be influenced by white people.\n\nLet me give you an example. The British Methodist Church in the UK adopted homosexuality and even went to the extreme to allow same sex marriage in their church, but we still have British Methodist Church in Nigeria. They did not change their name but cut their ties. They went public to tell the people that the decision of the British Methodist Church is strictly their own, which remains in their country and it has no bearings on the Methodist Church in Nigeria. How is that different?\n\nIt is the same thing we are also asking for. Not a name change but total autonomy. If today the Americans decide to allow homosexuality or same sex marriage in their church, they are not going to force that on us. We have our constitution and our rules. We can develop our theology, our own worship and we are going to remain the United Methodist Church in Nigeria.\n\nOn funding the church in case of break-up\n\nAnde: That is why they are fighting to be part of the Global Methodist Church because they think the white men will give them money. Yes, if they are sincere let them do like our own. We want autonomy, we want to be independent where we can decide on our own. We don\u2019t want any funding, they can take their funding and we sustain ourselves. No American, no English will impose their theology on us. Again they cannot force us to change our name. We are asking for powers that we can make our own decisions, that\u2019s all. And how is that hard for people to understand?\n\nOn the way forward\n\nAnde: The way forward for the church is honesty, transparency and accountability. The reason you are seeing all these happening is because there is no honesty and transparency in the leadership. I have worked as an administrative assistant, I know the struggle I have throughout the four years I have been serving as a voice for justice, accountability and it is part of the reasons why I was removed because I stood up and maintained that everyone must be accountable, including the bishop.",

          "text": "The Director-General (DG) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said the contributions of Nigerians at home and abroad could positively impact the nation\u2019s economy to bring about peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe DG said this at a webinar to celebrate the National Diaspora Day on Sunday, in Abuja, organised by the Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to commemorate its establishment and its achievements so far.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the event was themed: \u201d Diaspora Integration for National Peace and Development\u201d, which NiDCOM described as being anchored on the levers of peace that would accelerate Diaspora engagement for national growth and development.\n\nThe commission observed that no nation could succeed in an atmosphere anchored on insecurity, hatred and divisive tendencies.\n\nIn her contribution, Okonjo-Iweala applauded the Diaspora for their huge contributions to the nation\u2019s economy, citing in particular how their remittances had brought about development of the rural areas and the sustenance of the economy.\n\n\u201dLet me applaud fellow Nigerians in the Diaspora because they are contributing so much, in many ways; the remittance that the Diaspora sent home is in millions of dollars which has contributed in sustaining our economy.\n\n\u201cIt helps people living in the rural areas to get resources to send their children to school, take care of their health, build and run businesses, but we can do more wherever we are in the Diaspora, for there\u2019s no place like home.\n\n\u201cSo, what we should be thinking of is how we can help to make things better wherever we are, be it in the village or the town to make things better at home, either through creating employment, business, a civil society organisation, or helping to support what the local government is trying to do.\n\n\u201cThis is what helps to create peace and I am not saying that is all of it, but the fact remains that there are so many young people who do not have jobs and the COVID-19 situation had made that worse with the lockdown.\n\n\u201cI think we should be thinking of what we can do to help improve the economic situation of people at home because that\u2019s what helps to bring peace.\n\n\u201cIf we did not have so many disoriented and disorganised unemployed youths , some of the activities that we see at home that are detrimental towards peace and security might not happen,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his remarks earlier, Amb. Zubairu Dada, the Minister for State for Foreign Affairs, stated that the Federal Government was willing to create an enabling environment that would encourage direct investment by the diaspora.\n\nDada added that Nigerians in the Diaspora had continuously shown great dedication, with their time, skills, talents, resources and global exposure, to the development of the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s event encapsulates the intention of Nigeria in high engagement with her diaspora, especially in these times when we badly need peace, if any development is ever to take place.\n\n\u201cThis celebration is also a networking event intended to showcase the achievements of Nigerians in the Diaspora, particularly our internationally acknowledged surgeons, educationists, world class athletes, engineers, lawyers and scientists, among others.\n\n\u201cMen and women who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers for their huge contribution to the peace and progress of their host countries and humanity in general.\n\n\u201cI wish to assure you that the federal government of Nigeria will provide an enabling environment, through policies and programmes tailored to support you and your wellbeing, and in turn encourage you to give back for the upliftment of your country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the government had taken a further step by approving and adopting the National Diaspora Policy 2021 and its Action Plan, for a more holistic approach to the nation\u2019s engagement with the diaspora.\n\nMrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Chairman/CEO of NIDCOM, noted that development could only thrive in a peaceful environment, hence the need for maximum cooperation to collaborate.\n\nShe urged the diaspora to collaborate with Nigeria, their country of origin, in sharing ideas , technology and others skills, that would promote her development.\n\nThe National Diaspora Policy 2021 was unveiled by the NiDCOM Boss, Mr Franz Celestin, Chief of Mission, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Sir Chibuzor Ugochi of the Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, (NIDO UK-SOUTH), NAN reported.",

          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu Suffering For The Sins Of Igbo Leaders, By SKC Ogbonnia",
          "text": "Ezekiel 18:20: \u201cA son must not suffer the punishment for the father\u2019s guilt\u2026\u201d Therefore, those grandstanding as Igbo leaders should be falling on top of each other protesting, demanding President Muhammadu Buhari to detain them instead of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. The objective fact is that Kanu is suffering for the sins of the Igbo leaders.\n\nTHE FIRST SIN of these Igbo leaders is lack of development in Igboland that drew the ire of Kanu in the first place. Mazi Kanu, remember, began to gain national prominence not long after General Buhari gained democratic power in 2015. Key to Kanu\u2019s popularity among the masses was his boldness to say enough is enough after the leaders from the South-East and South-South zones failed to hold President Buhari accountable for the naked threat to marginalize the Biafran region simply because the people voted en masse for their native son, President Goodluck Jonathan. But their failure to confront Buhari is understandable. Most of these Eastern leaders\u2014like their counterparts in other regions\u2014are virally corrupt. Thus, they continue to fear that the president would readily revenge by marshalling the anticorruption agency against them.\n\nSuch dilemma prompted my piece: \u201cBuhari And Nnamdi Kanu Fighting The Wrong Enemies.\u201d There I reminded that before Buhari\u2019s presidency, a major aim of Radio Biafra, in Kanu\u2019s own words, was to uproot \u201call looters, embezzlers, kidnappers, sponsors of terrorism, child traffickers, corrupt judges, crooked university lecturers, murderous Nigerian security forces and all thieving individuals masquerading as public officials who steal public funds thereby preventing developmental projects from impacting positively on the lives of the ordinary people.\u201d Yes!\n\nI then followed that, if Buhari was ever sincere with his election campaign promise to fight corruption, the President and Kanu ought to have common enemies in the very corrupt leaders from the South-East and South-South zones of Nigeria who plundered development opportunities in Biafra land during the last 16 years of the astronomical oil boom before Buhari assumed democratic power.\n\nTHE SECOND SIN of the Igbo leaders is their nonchalant attitude towards the long-standing policy of the Federal authorities to reduce the Igbo nation to a mere \u201cdot in a circle.\u201d In fact, what most people do not know is that Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s biggest crime against the Nigerian state is actually his doggedness to expose the major truths why the country does not promote the teaching of history in its schools. The most stubborn of those truths is that the Igbo nation is NOT landlocked, after all. Unlike the Igbo leaders, Nnamdi Kanu is a student of the History and has stoutly rejected the \u201cdot in a circle\u201d label far before Buhari made the conspiracy public. The IPOB leader understands that, besides the South-East geopolitical zone, there are indigenous Igbo areas in the North-Central and the South-South zones, including the riverine areas of Nigeria. The point is that Igbo nation is far beyond Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s \u201cdot in a circle\u201d map, well into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBut Buhari is not solely to blame for the \u201cdot in a circle\u201d propaganda. He inherited the script from the Igbo marginalization scheme that began during the Biafran war. Central to such scheme is to sustain an artificial boundary which must suggest that the Igbo people suddenly no longer have access to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nStop here for a minute and take a critical look at the Nigeria map, featuring the six geopolitical zones. Any discerning mind would notice the devious manner Federal authorities lumped the indigenous Igbo areas that have natural access to the sea into the South-South zone.\n\nMake no mistake about this: No one is wishing for a perfect homogenous state or zone. After all, there are indigenous Igala communities in the South-East zone, as there are indigenous Igbo communities in the North-Central zone. The problem here is the double standard. On the one hand, the Fulani flock\u2014a recent immigrant to Nigeria\u2014is free to align with the Hausa to assume a new ethnic identity: Hausa-Fulani. Moreover, the Fulani is not only free to lay claim to Fulani settlements in the three zones of Northern Nigeria, but the group also prides itself for wielding the disparate Northern ethnic nationalities into a homogenous political identity. These moves by the Fulani are politically strategic and definitively worthy of emulation. On the other hand, however, any attempt by the Igbo\u2014an indigenous settler in Nigeria\u2014to identify with her indigenous components in the South-South zone or even to align with any other ethnic group is viewed as a taboo by the Federal authorities. The latent policy of Nigeria is that the Igbo must be seen as not only as \u201ca dot in a circle\u201d but must also be viewed as a political leper.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike Nnamdi Kanu, the Igbo leaders are grossly na\u00efve. They have been busy, aiding and abetting the Federal authorities to re-write the Igbo history for their individual interests. Today, any mention of Igbo is squarely pegged to the South-East zone. Today, there is hardly any Igbo organization or those in position of power that promote the Igbo agenda beyond the South-East zone. Unlike Nnamdi Kanu, the Igbo leaders prefer to forget that Ohaneze Ndigbo, for example, factually refers to indigenous Igbo communities in thirteen states in three geopolitical zones, namely: South-East: Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states; South-South zone: Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross-River, Delta, Edo (Igbanke), and Rivers; and North-Central: Benue and Kogi States.\n\nUnlike Nnamdi Kanu, the so-called Igbo leaders are too daft to remember that the former Secretary-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, a Biafran war commander, and the late Secretary-General of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Joe Achuzia, is not from the South-East zone. Needless to mention that Ralph Uwechue, a native of Ogwashi-Uku in Delta State, was once the President General of Ohaneze; and the eminent pan-Igbo activist, Uche Okwukwu, a native of Ikwere in Rivers State, was not long ago the Secretary-General of the Ohaneze.\n\nTHE THIRD AND MOST SENSATIONAL SIN of the Igbo leaders is their penchant to appease Buhari and the enemies of Ndigbo by carrying on as if Biafra was ever solely a South-East affair or rather a mere \u201ca dot in a circle\u201d. Unlike the Igbo leaders, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu clearly understands that Biafra is not even an Igbo word; and it was Frank Opigo, an Ijaw\u2014not Igbo\u2014who christened the new nation after the then Bight of Biafra, now ironically changed to Bight of Bonny. The IPOB leader does not forget that the last Head of State of Biafra, Major-General Phillip Effiong, a native of Ibiono Ibom in Akwa Ibom State, is not from the South-East zone. He knows that the ancient city of Asaba, the bloody epicenter of the Biafran war, is in the South-South zone. Nnamdi Kanu recognizes that Chukwuma Nzeogwu, a native of Okpanam in Delta State, who led the first military coup of 1966, commonly blamed for the civil war, was from the present South-South zone. The IPOB leaders is bold to expose the true history which clearly states that a major objective of the first Nigerian coup was to free Obafemi Awolowo from prison and make him the prime minister of the country.\n\nThe analysis into the current Biafran crisis should not only go beyond the fleeting exigencies of secession, it ought to also consider the dynamics of the message, not only the messenger. The problem must not revolve solely around how Kanu delivers his message. The problem is that the Igbo leaders who claim to know how best to deliver the message choose to do nothing at all. The bigger problem, though, is that President Buhari\u2019s pattern of injustice continues to inflame the Biafran crisis.\n\nDr. SKC Ogbonnia, a 2019 APC Presidential Aspirant, writes from Houston, Texas.\n\nTwitter @SKCOgbonnia",

          "text": "Following the release of 28 students of Bethel Baptist High School Kaduna on Sunday, parents of the children have been recounting their ordeal while their children were in bandits\u2019 captivity.\n\nOne of the parents, Malam Danboyi Begs, said her daughter Louis was kidnapped the day she was to start her NECO examinations, adding that she celebrated her 16th birthday in the forest.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy daughter was kidnapped the day she was to start her Neco examination, she celebrated her 16th birthday on July 23 in the bush with kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhen they were abducted several thought went through my mind because thousands have gone and they killed them in the bush, i was just living by the grace of God. One that usually keep me awake in the night is whenever I think of where she is, which bush is she being kept now I won\u2019t be able to sleep. But glory to God she is back,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Hosea Garba Maisamari, said, \u201cit has not been easy since we received the report, even for a day. The issue of ransom it is only the school management that can answer that but for us God has done it. He would continue his education in the school because this thing (kidnapping) happen everywhere even in the house. Government should take precaution and address the issue.\u201d\n\nMalam Danladi Badi is a very happy man on Sunday after receiving his daughter Ruth who was released from bandits captivity.\n\n\u201cI want to thank God because the only word on my lips now is gratitude to God who did it. Ruth was born April 8 2009 she is in JSS3. We are praying to God to grant us the release of the remaining students,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMr Ndas Hassan Adamu was unperturbed as his son Destiny was kidnapped 20 days ago as he believed he is not destined to be killed and will lived up to his destiny.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling very happy, feeling like a complete father after receiving my son. He is 10 years old, while he was away, I always pray to God to because I believe he would live up to his name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the process of their release maybe ransom was paid or not but I believe God did His wonders. The God that has started the work will complete it to ensure the release of the remaining students. Our prayer would continue without ceasing, He owned all of us including the kidnappers.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr Jacob James felt government should have come to their aid to rescue their children.\n\n\u201cI feel very bad that they were in captivity for that long without government doing anything about it. If one American was kidnapped in Niger Republic and America came all the way to seek his release, Nigerian government should do more. I had to leave my school in Jos because things are not the same. So far my child Goodness, was released, others would be released,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s consistent consistency on NYSC -NigPilot",
          "text": "This year alone, much more than the last four decades of the existence of the institution of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), there have been nearly a dozen well-researched books that speak to the strategic essence of that national asset known as the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nThanks to the intellectual bent of the Director-General of the NYSC Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim ably assisted by his loyal management team, the nation now has a rich rapporteur of books on the National Youth Service Corps Scheme. It was said that Nigerians do not have a way of preservation of national memorials but the management of the NYSC at the moment has successfully debunked that negative stereotype.\n\nAnd as we know it, the finest way to preserve history is to put facts down on well written and produced books.\n\nOne of the nine books on the NYSC inaugurated recently when the NYSC clocked 40 years is the National Youth Service Corps and National integration.\n\nThis aforementioned scholarly book is written jointly and severally by well respected University teachers including the Director-General of NYSC just as co-editors are listed as Bem Japhet Audu, Maryam Hamza and Onah Peter Otumala.\n\nGoing through this book, I was able to gain some insights on the import and essence of the NYSC Vis-\u00e0-vis its fundamental function of representing the pillar for the promotion of national integration. No doubt Nigeria is an amalgam of nearly 300 Ethnic nationalities with very rich cultures, traditions and Worldviews.\n\nFrom the preface, we were told this: \u201cNational Integration is the hallmark of unity and development in any polity. National integration is the awareness of a common identity among the citizens of different ethnic groups in a country; this means that although we belong to different ethnic groups, religions and speak different languages, yet we recognize the fact that we are all one. It is not just a feeling of national belonging, but also, the feelings which bring people of all dialects, culture and beliefs together in common endeavour, goals and aspirations. National integration has for a long time, become an increasingly investigated topical issue, due to its multi-dimensional and overarching connotations especially in relation to most African nations.\u201d\n\nAnd that \u201c Nigeria emerged as a country within the imperialistic activities of Britain, which subjugated diverse nationalities and organized them into one state in 1914, with the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorates. At independence in 1960, the Nigerian state materialized with serious socio-political fundamental problems. The most critical challenge is lack of nation-building and leadership was blinded from unifying the people into a cohesive socio-political whole, the various entities that were lump together by the colonialists.\u201d\n\nThe NYSC is one of the few national Institutions that currently has the luck of being ably led by one of the finest Directors General just as it is obvious that the current President is one person in Nigeria that has remained consistently consistent in displaying practical passion, love and good will for the NYSC. So it can be said that NYSC is not just a Child of Necessity but a beloved CHILD OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI.\n\nThe President Muhammadu Buhari has almost created a positive legacy for himself in the area of youth sector and the NYSC specifically right from the inception of his government in 2015.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on September 13, 2016 in Daura, called on Nigerian youths to make the country great again through pursuit of knowledge, patriotism and commitment to values that promote national unity.\n\nReceiving over 100 National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, members serving in Daura local government area in his residence, President Buhari pledged his unalloyed commitment to the unity and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\nHe urged them to remain focused in life, pursue their dreams and reject those fanning embers of discord and disintegration of the country.\n\nThe President, who specially recognised corps members from the Niger Delta and South-Eastern states serving in Daura, praised the vision of former President Yakubu Gowon in setting up the scheme in 1973.\n\nThe President said the scheme had creditably promoted national unity and cohesion by exposing young people to the country\u2019s uniqueness and cultural diversity.\n\n\u201cI asked for those from the other extreme of Nigeria because I very much appreciate the NYSC scheme and whenever I see General Gowon, I always thank him for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a military commander, I walked from Degema, a border town between the north and the east, to the border between Cameroons and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI walked on my feet for most of the 30 months that we fought the Nigeria-Biafra civil war, in which at least two million Nigerians were killed.\n\n\u201cWe were made by our leaders to go and fight Biafra not because of money or oil, because oil was not a critical factor then, but because of one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo if leaderships at various levels failed, it was not the fault of the rest of Nigerians who have no quarrel with one another.\n\n\u201cSo please tell your colleagues that we must be together to build this country.\n\n\u2018\u2019Those who work hard will earn a respectable living. I have seen this country, I fought for this country and I will continue to work for the unity of this country.\u201d The President said.\n\nBuhari said on the last day of August 2017 that he is always pleased to see the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) achieving the purpose of national unity that inspired its creation since 1973.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen at his country home after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers, President Buhari said the NYSC scheme had over the years continued to pursue the purpose of integrating the country, noting that the diversity of cultures remained Nigeria\u2019s greatest strength.\n\n\u201cI am always pleased to see corps members in Daura and other parts of the country. From the postings, we get to learn more about other cultures,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said the large number of corps members in Daura, mostly from the Southern part of the country, was an indication that the dream of a unified Nigeria remained a reality.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that graduates from the North, who served in the Southern states, also learnt a lot from the diversity that had made Nigeria a unique country.\n\nPresident Buhari observed that serving, as an army officer, in some Southern parts of the country such as Lagos and Ibadan were very rich experiences.\n\nThe President was accompanied to the Eid-el-Kabir prayers by Presidential aides, members of his family, and neighbours.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday August 21st 2018 gave an indication that his administration would not scrap the National Youth Service Corps scheme as being proposed in some quarters.\n\nReaffirming his support for the scheme established in 1973, the President said he had thanked a former military leader, Gen. Yakubu Gowon (retd.), for the initiative.\n\nBuhari spoke while granting audience to members of the NYSC currently serving in Daura community, Katsina State, shortly after he joined the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Farouk, and other Muslim faithful, to observe the Eid prayers at the Kofar Arewa Eid Ground, Daura.\n\nThe audience has become part of his schedules during Sallah celebrations.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement, quoted the President as saying that it was better for youths to know all the parts of the country than being familiar with only their states.\n\nThe President said, \u2018\u2018It is better to know all the country than for people to be state-inclined.\n\n\u2018I always look forward to meeting the NYSC team because since I served mostly in the south when I was in the military, some people in Lagos, the only thing they know is the sea.\n\n\u2018\u2018For them (NYSC members) to be brought to the desert or near the Sahel region is a very difficult thing but it will make an impact on Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have personally spoken to Gen. Gowon to thank him for having the initiative to start the NYSC. It is very good for Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President formally welcomed the corps members to Daura and asked them to enjoy their national service year.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Sunday August 10th 2019 in Daura, Katsina State, challenged members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to use their education and privilege of visiting different parts of the country to unite Nigerians.\n\nReceiving the youth corps members at his country home in Daura during the Eid el-Kabir Sallah celebration, alongside the President of Republic of Guinea, Prof. Alfa Conde, President Buhari said the primary focus of the NYSC is to expose graduates to the beauty and diversity of the country, and return to their states or any part of the country to share their experiences.\n\nThe President said they should always emphasize the common values of peaceful co-existence, kindness and hospitality that cut across all cultures and religion in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the entire nation depends on past and serving youth corps members to bridge the country, since they have the first-hand experience of living with different ethnic groups in various parts of the country, studying their cultures and traditions, and enjoying hospitality, which underpins every community in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom Lagos, Port Harcourt and other parts of the country, you are at the end of the country. This posting will make you know this place, Daura, and you can disabuse the minds of those who are not educated about the other side of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is only the NYSC that is merging us together and of course, the police and soldiers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President noted that in every meeting with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who initiated the programme in 1973 to promote unity and understanding among Nigerians, he always remembers to appreciate the ingenuity of the programme and need for continuity.\n\nPresident Buhari donated two cows and ten bags of rice to the corps members, and some money, while the President of the Republic of Guinea also complemented with two cows\n\nPresident Muhammad Buhari, on Tuesday, July 19th 2021 in Daura donated N1million, two cows, and 20 bags of rice to National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members serving in the Daura Local Government Area of Katsina State\n\nMr. Alex Obemeata, NYSC\u2019s spokesperson in Katsina, who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, said the President\u2019s gesture was delivered to them when they visited him in Daura to celebrate the Eid-El-Kabir.\n\n\u201cIt was another joyous Sallah day for the corps members serving in Daura, the country home of Mr President, as he was at home for the 2021 Sallah celebration.\n\n\u201cUsually, when Mr President is at home for Sallah celebration, corps members go to his house to welcome him and wish him \u2018Happy Sallah\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn like manner, on July 20, 2021, the corps members in Daura were at the President\u2019s house for the Sallah wishes, and it was a celebration of the century.\n\n\u201cThey were given two cows, 20 bags of rice, and N1 million.\u201d The NYSC spokesperson disclosed.\n\nHe said that the President commended the NYSC members and urged them to be good ambassadors of their country and committed towards the development of Nigeria.\n\nThe senior special Assistant on media and publicity Mr. Garba Shehu sent out the following media release and stated that President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State, expressed his deep attachment to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and impact so far, saying it broadens the horizon of citizens, opens up opportunities and enhances understanding of cultural differences.\n\nSpeaking at his country home to youth corps members serving in Daura, who visited him for Eid-el-Kabir homage, the President said he had consistently commended former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon for the initiative, which had created more opportunity for uniting the country.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the youth corps members to make the most out of the opportunity of travelling around the country, especially in understanding different climates, cultures, languages and outviews on life.\n\n\u201cEverytime I meet with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, like recently, I still commend him for the initiative of the NYSC. The NYSC is spectacular in many ways.\n\n\u201cSome of you have come from Port Harcourt, Lagos and Calabar and you can now feel the heat of Daura and how close it is to the desert,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the NYSC scheme was well thought-out to unite the country through understanding.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly about the NYSC and I am wishing you all the very best. I assure you that you will be much better as Nigerians after your experience,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the corps members two cows from his farm, 20 bags of rice and N1, 000,000 (one million naira).\n\nThe Corps Liason Officer, Umaru Babayo thanked the President for all the efforts and sacrifices to restore peace in the country, and the policies to diversify the economy, with agriculture as the main driver.\n\nHe said the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, had shown a lot of kindness and warmth to corps members as well in his domain, appreciating the community for always supporting them.\n\nBabayo assured the President of prayers for a successful time in office, and God\u2019s providence in decision making that will move the country forward.\n\nThen before the year 2021 Sallah homage to the President by the Corpers, something special happened in faraway Ogun State when the DG of NYSC and his management team paid an unscheduled visit to the man who composed the anthem of NYSC.\n\nThe Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Ibrahim Shuaibu, last Thursday, visited Reverend Oluwole Adetiran, the composer of the NYSC anthem, at his Mowe-Ibafo residence in Ogun State.\n\nPa Adetiran, a corps member in 1984, composed the evergreen NYSC anthem while serving at the Polytechnic, Ibadan.\n\nThe NYSC boss appreciated the stellar and indelible contribution of the septuagenarian to the scheme and assured him of support for his wellbeing.\n\nIn his response, Adetiran, who was surrounded by family members during the visit, thanked the Director-General and his team from Lagos and Ogun states, expressing joy at being remembered in his lifetime.\n\nHe urged the youth to be selfless and dedicated to national development.\n\nAddressing journalists, the NYSC boss called on corps members across the country to be patriotic in service, so that they too could be celebrated in the future.\n\nHe noted that in its 48-year history, more than five million Nigerians had successfully gone through the Service, stating that the scheme remains a veritable tool for national development, with corps members strongly represented in every major strata of the economy.\n\nThese are collectively a positive symbolism demonstrating the fact that Nigerians can indeed bring out their best if they are placed in their best positions. Just like footballers who excel when positioned appropriately, the lesson from all of these narratives made by me out of the abundance of empirical evidence is that Nigeria will triumph and overcome her existential challenges but only if merit, competence and professionalism are elevated as national ethos of Nigeria.\n\n\u2026 ONWUBIKO is head of the HUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) and was a federal commissioner at the National Human Rights commission of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s consistent consistency on NYSC -NigPilot",
          "text": "This year alone, much more than the last four decades of the existence of the institution of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), there have been nearly a dozen well-researched books that speak to the strategic essence of that national asset known as the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nThanks to the intellectual bent of the Director-General of the NYSC Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim ably assisted by his loyal management team, the nation now has a rich rapporteur of books on the National Youth Service Corps Scheme. It was said that Nigerians do not have a way of preservation of national memorials but the management of the NYSC at the moment has successfully debunked that negative stereotype.\n\nAnd as we know it, the finest way to preserve history is to put facts down on well written and produced books.\n\nOne of the nine books on the NYSC inaugurated recently when the NYSC clocked 40 years is the National Youth Service Corps and National integration.\n\nThis aforementioned scholarly book is written jointly and severally by well respected University teachers including the Director-General of NYSC just as co-editors are listed as Bem Japhet Audu, Maryam Hamza and Onah Peter Otumala.\n\nGoing through this book, I was able to gain some insights on the import and essence of the NYSC Vis-\u00e0-vis its fundamental function of representing the pillar for the promotion of national integration. No doubt Nigeria is an amalgam of nearly 300 Ethnic nationalities with very rich cultures, traditions and Worldviews.\n\nFrom the preface, we were told this: \u201cNational Integration is the hallmark of unity and development in any polity. National integration is the awareness of a common identity among the citizens of different ethnic groups in a country; this means that although we belong to different ethnic groups, religions and speak different languages, yet we recognize the fact that we are all one. It is not just a feeling of national belonging, but also, the feelings which bring people of all dialects, culture and beliefs together in common endeavour, goals and aspirations. National integration has for a long time, become an increasingly investigated topical issue, due to its multi-dimensional and overarching connotations especially in relation to most African nations.\u201d\n\nAnd that \u201c Nigeria emerged as a country within the imperialistic activities of Britain, which subjugated diverse nationalities and organized them into one state in 1914, with the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern protectorates. At independence in 1960, the Nigerian state materialized with serious socio-political fundamental problems. The most critical challenge is lack of nation-building and leadership was blinded from unifying the people into a cohesive socio-political whole, the various entities that were lump together by the colonialists.\u201d\n\nThe NYSC is one of the few national Institutions that currently has the luck of being ably led by one of the finest Directors General just as it is obvious that the current President is one person in Nigeria that has remained consistently consistent in displaying practical passion, love and good will for the NYSC. So it can be said that NYSC is not just a Child of Necessity but a beloved CHILD OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI.\n\nThe President Muhammadu Buhari has almost created a positive legacy for himself in the area of youth sector and the NYSC specifically right from the inception of his government in 2015.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on September 13, 2016 in Daura, called on Nigerian youths to make the country great again through pursuit of knowledge, patriotism and commitment to values that promote national unity.\n\nReceiving over 100 National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, members serving in Daura local government area in his residence, President Buhari pledged his unalloyed commitment to the unity and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\nHe urged them to remain focused in life, pursue their dreams and reject those fanning embers of discord and disintegration of the country.\n\nThe President, who specially recognised corps members from the Niger Delta and South-Eastern states serving in Daura, praised the vision of former President Yakubu Gowon in setting up the scheme in 1973.\n\nThe President said the scheme had creditably promoted national unity and cohesion by exposing young people to the country\u2019s uniqueness and cultural diversity.\n\n\u201cI asked for those from the other extreme of Nigeria because I very much appreciate the NYSC scheme and whenever I see General Gowon, I always thank him for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a military commander, I walked from Degema, a border town between the north and the east, to the border between Cameroons and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI walked on my feet for most of the 30 months that we fought the Nigeria-Biafra civil war, in which at least two million Nigerians were killed.\n\n\u201cWe were made by our leaders to go and fight Biafra not because of money or oil, because oil was not a critical factor then, but because of one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo if leaderships at various levels failed, it was not the fault of the rest of Nigerians who have no quarrel with one another.\n\n\u201cSo please tell your colleagues that we must be together to build this country.\n\n\u2018\u2019Those who work hard will earn a respectable living. I have seen this country, I fought for this country and I will continue to work for the unity of this country.\u201d The President said.\n\nBuhari said on the last day of August 2017 that he is always pleased to see the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) achieving the purpose of national unity that inspired its creation since 1973.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen at his country home after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers, President Buhari said the NYSC scheme had over the years continued to pursue the purpose of integrating the country, noting that the diversity of cultures remained Nigeria\u2019s greatest strength.\n\n\u201cI am always pleased to see corps members in Daura and other parts of the country. From the postings, we get to learn more about other cultures,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said the large number of corps members in Daura, mostly from the Southern part of the country, was an indication that the dream of a unified Nigeria remained a reality.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that graduates from the North, who served in the Southern states, also learnt a lot from the diversity that had made Nigeria a unique country.\n\nPresident Buhari observed that serving, as an army officer, in some Southern parts of the country such as Lagos and Ibadan were very rich experiences.\n\nThe President was accompanied to the Eid-el-Kabir prayers by Presidential aides, members of his family, and neighbours.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday August 21st 2018 gave an indication that his administration would not scrap the National Youth Service Corps scheme as being proposed in some quarters.\n\nReaffirming his support for the scheme established in 1973, the President said he had thanked a former military leader, Gen. Yakubu Gowon (retd.), for the initiative.\n\nBuhari spoke while granting audience to members of the NYSC currently serving in Daura community, Katsina State, shortly after he joined the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Farouk, and other Muslim faithful, to observe the Eid prayers at the Kofar Arewa Eid Ground, Daura.\n\nThe audience has become part of his schedules during Sallah celebrations.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement, quoted the President as saying that it was better for youths to know all the parts of the country than being familiar with only their states.\n\nThe President said, \u2018\u2018It is better to know all the country than for people to be state-inclined.\n\n\u2018I always look forward to meeting the NYSC team because since I served mostly in the south when I was in the military, some people in Lagos, the only thing they know is the sea.\n\n\u2018\u2018For them (NYSC members) to be brought to the desert or near the Sahel region is a very difficult thing but it will make an impact on Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have personally spoken to Gen. Gowon to thank him for having the initiative to start the NYSC. It is very good for Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President formally welcomed the corps members to Daura and asked them to enjoy their national service year.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Sunday August 10th 2019 in Daura, Katsina State, challenged members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to use their education and privilege of visiting different parts of the country to unite Nigerians.\n\nReceiving the youth corps members at his country home in Daura during the Eid el-Kabir Sallah celebration, alongside the President of Republic of Guinea, Prof. Alfa Conde, President Buhari said the primary focus of the NYSC is to expose graduates to the beauty and diversity of the country, and return to their states or any part of the country to share their experiences.\n\nThe President said they should always emphasize the common values of peaceful co-existence, kindness and hospitality that cut across all cultures and religion in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the entire nation depends on past and serving youth corps members to bridge the country, since they have the first-hand experience of living with different ethnic groups in various parts of the country, studying their cultures and traditions, and enjoying hospitality, which underpins every community in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom Lagos, Port Harcourt and other parts of the country, you are at the end of the country. This posting will make you know this place, Daura, and you can disabuse the minds of those who are not educated about the other side of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is only the NYSC that is merging us together and of course, the police and soldiers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President noted that in every meeting with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who initiated the programme in 1973 to promote unity and understanding among Nigerians, he always remembers to appreciate the ingenuity of the programme and need for continuity.\n\nPresident Buhari donated two cows and ten bags of rice to the corps members, and some money, while the President of the Republic of Guinea also complemented with two cows\n\nPresident Muhammad Buhari, on Tuesday, July 19th 2021 in Daura donated N1million, two cows, and 20 bags of rice to National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members serving in the Daura Local Government Area of Katsina State\n\nMr. Alex Obemeata, NYSC\u2019s spokesperson in Katsina, who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, said the President\u2019s gesture was delivered to them when they visited him in Daura to celebrate the Eid-El-Kabir.\n\n\u201cIt was another joyous Sallah day for the corps members serving in Daura, the country home of Mr President, as he was at home for the 2021 Sallah celebration.\n\n\u201cUsually, when Mr President is at home for Sallah celebration, corps members go to his house to welcome him and wish him \u2018Happy Sallah\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn like manner, on July 20, 2021, the corps members in Daura were at the President\u2019s house for the Sallah wishes, and it was a celebration of the century.\n\n\u201cThey were given two cows, 20 bags of rice, and N1 million.\u201d The NYSC spokesperson disclosed.\n\nHe said that the President commended the NYSC members and urged them to be good ambassadors of their country and committed towards the development of Nigeria.\n\nThe senior special Assistant on media and publicity Mr. Garba Shehu sent out the following media release and stated that President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State, expressed his deep attachment to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and impact so far, saying it broadens the horizon of citizens, opens up opportunities and enhances understanding of cultural differences.\n\nSpeaking at his country home to youth corps members serving in Daura, who visited him for Eid-el-Kabir homage, the President said he had consistently commended former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon for the initiative, which had created more opportunity for uniting the country.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the youth corps members to make the most out of the opportunity of travelling around the country, especially in understanding different climates, cultures, languages and outviews on life.\n\n\u201cEverytime I meet with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, like recently, I still commend him for the initiative of the NYSC. The NYSC is spectacular in many ways.\n\n\u201cSome of you have come from Port Harcourt, Lagos and Calabar and you can now feel the heat of Daura and how close it is to the desert,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the NYSC scheme was well thought-out to unite the country through understanding.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly about the NYSC and I am wishing you all the very best. I assure you that you will be much better as Nigerians after your experience,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the corps members two cows from his farm, 20 bags of rice and N1, 000,000 (one million naira).\n\nThe Corps Liason Officer, Umaru Babayo thanked the President for all the efforts and sacrifices to restore peace in the country, and the policies to diversify the economy, with agriculture as the main driver.\n\nHe said the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, had shown a lot of kindness and warmth to corps members as well in his domain, appreciating the community for always supporting them.\n\nBabayo assured the President of prayers for a successful time in office, and God\u2019s providence in decision making that will move the country forward.\n\nThen before the year 2021 Sallah homage to the President by the Corpers, something special happened in faraway Ogun State when the DG of NYSC and his management team paid an unscheduled visit to the man who composed the anthem of NYSC.\n\nThe Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Ibrahim Shuaibu, last Thursday, visited Reverend Oluwole Adetiran, the composer of the NYSC anthem, at his Mowe-Ibafo residence in Ogun State.\n\nPa Adetiran, a corps member in 1984, composed the evergreen NYSC anthem while serving at the Polytechnic, Ibadan.\n\nThe NYSC boss appreciated the stellar and indelible contribution of the septuagenarian to the scheme and assured him of support for his wellbeing.\n\nIn his response, Adetiran, who was surrounded by family members during the visit, thanked the Director-General and his team from Lagos and Ogun states, expressing joy at being remembered in his lifetime.\n\nHe urged the youth to be selfless and dedicated to national development.\n\nAddressing journalists, the NYSC boss called on corps members across the country to be patriotic in service, so that they too could be celebrated in the future.\n\nHe noted that in its 48-year history, more than five million Nigerians had successfully gone through the Service, stating that the scheme remains a veritable tool for national development, with corps members strongly represented in every major strata of the economy.\n\nThese are collectively a positive symbolism demonstrating the fact that Nigerians can indeed bring out their best if they are placed in their best positions. Just like footballers who excel when positioned appropriately, the lesson from all of these narratives made by me out of the abundance of empirical evidence is that Nigeria will triumph and overcome her existential challenges but only if merit, competence and professionalism are elevated as national ethos of Nigeria.\n\n\u2026 ONWUBIKO is head of the HUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) and was a federal commissioner at the National Human Rights commission of Nigeria.",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Protesters have taken to the streets across Brazil once more to demand far-right President Jair Bolsonaro step down over his government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as recent corruption allegations.\n\nDemonstrators marched in Rio de Janeiro and several other cities nationwide on Saturday in the latest display of public anger and frustration to hit the South American nation in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protesting about many things: the government\u2019s downplaying of the pandemic, the president\u2019s spurning of health safety measures, the slow rollout of vaccines, which has picked up in the last couple of weeks,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Monica Yanakiew reported from Rio.\n\n\u201cBut still Brazil was a country that should not have had these problems because it is a country that is usually prepared for mass vaccination.\u201d\n\nProtest organisers said actions were scheduled to take place in 500 locations across Brazil and outside the country, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported. The demonstrators complained about Brazil\u2019s late-starting vaccination programme and high unemployment rate, and demanded more emergency aid for poor people grappling with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because it is time to react to the genocidal government that we have, that has taken over our country,\u201d said Marcos Kirst, a protester in Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that everyone who feels offended or oppressed by this government comes out to the streets, because we need to fight for the return to democracy,\u201d Laise de Oliveira, a 65-year-old social worker, told the AFP news agency in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBolsonaro, a coronavirus sceptic who has repeatedly played down the severity of COVID-19, for months has rejected calls to impose public health restrictions to stem the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 548,000 people across Brazil, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThat is the second-highest death toll in the world after the United States.\n\nA protester holds a banner that reads \u2018Vaccine\u2019 and \u2018Impeachment\u2019 during a demonstration against Boslonaro in Rio de Janeiro [Ricardo Moraes/Reuters]\n\nA Brazilian Senate commission in April launched an investigation into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, while Bolsonaro has seen his popularity drop amid a string of scandals. A recent poll showed a majority of Brazilians would support an effort to impeach him.\n\nThe far-right leader is under political pressure after questions surfaced about alleged irregularities in his government\u2019s coronavirus vaccine procurement process, as well as accusations of past corruption. Bolsonaro has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is a continuous loss of political support for the president,\u201d Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Brazil, told Al Jazeera. Couto said while political will to impeach Bolsonaro is rising, the president retains considerable support in Congress.\n\n\u201cSince it is necessary two obtain at least two-thirds of the votes both in the House and at the Senate \u2013 (and) Bolsonaro has at least 40 percent of the seats both in the House and the Senate \u2013 it\u2019s impossible today,\u201d Couto said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the number of coronavirus deaths begins to recede and local restrictions are being rolled back in some places, experts have questioned whether Brazil\u2019s inoculation effort can pick up enough steam to stave off the spread of more contagious variants of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Delta variant is boosting cases and deaths globally after a period of decline, and the World Health Organization anticipates it will become dominant within months.\n\n\u201cIt will be explosive,\u201d Gonzalo Vecina, a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press news agency. \u201cThere will be a new wave. We are opening too much.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s Health Ministry counted 140 cases of the Delta variant by Friday, including in its three most populous states, and 12 deaths. Analysts say the figures are vast undercounts due to lack of testing and genome sequencing.\n\nDelta has been detected in at least 18 Latin American countries, according to the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nBrazilian Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said last week that getting more of the population vaccinated is the best way to stop the variant, but he insists that Brazil must resume its economic activities.\n\n\u201cWe have available hospital bed capacity and we will live with this pandemic until we can control it definitively,\u201d Queiroga said on Wednesday, stressing the importance of knowing whether each person infected with the variant has already had one shot or two.\n\nTo date, 17 percent of the Brazilian population is considered fully vaccinated while 44 percent have received the first of two jabs. The AstraZeneca shot makes up nearly half of all vaccines administered, China\u2019s Sinovac more than a third, and Pfizer most of the rest.",

          "text": "Tens of thousands of people across several countries, including France and Italy, have protested against anti-covid measures, with the French police using tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters in the capital Paris.\n\nIn France, an estimated 160,000 took to the streets in nationwide protests against President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s health pass that will drastically curtail access to restaurants and public spaces for unvaccinated people.\n\n\u201cFreedom, freedom\u201d, chanted demonstrators in France, carrying placards denouncing \u201cMacron, Tyrant\u201d, \u201cBig Pharma shackles freedom\u201d or saying \u201cNo to the pass of shame\u201d.\n\nA similar scheme, called \u201cgreen pass\u201d, has sparked angry demonstrations across Italy. People in Rome, Naples and Turin chanted \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cdown with the dictatorship\u201d over plans for the so-called \u201cgreen pass\u201d.\n\nThe certificate will be needed from early next month to eat in restaurants and visit cinemas among other indoor activities.\n\nMany people gathered without wearing masks \u2013 but the turnout was lower than expected.\n\nThousands of people have also protested in London, against what they describe as an erosion of their civil liberties.\n\nDemonstrators say the UK government\u2019s track and trace app is limiting their movements, with more than 600,000 told to self-isolate in one week alone this month. The protests come a week after most Coronavirus restrictions in England were lifted.\n\nEarlier, dozens of protesters were arrested after an unauthorised march in Sydney, Australia\u2019s largest city. Organisers had dubbed the protest a \u201cfreedom\u201d rally. Attendees carried signs and banners reading \u201cWake up Australia\u201d and \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d.\n\nHeidi Larson, a professor of anthropology, risk and decision science at the department of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Al Jazeera that the health pass \u201cmakes a lot of sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd ironically for those who want their freedoms, the vaccine can allow different freedoms,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, the options to this pass is that we close restaurants, we stop large gatherings. We have to give somewhere if we want to get ahead of this virus,\u201d Larson said.\n\nGabriel Scally, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, told Al Jazeera that there was nothing new to the opposition to the pandemic measures.\n\n\u201cI think these rallies are relatively small. All the way through the pandemic, we have seen small groups of people who have taken to the streets to express their opposition to various things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome believe that the virus does not exist, that COVID-19 doesn\u2019t exist. Some think that it\u2019s a conspiracy from all sorts of people, including Bill Gates\u2026\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything new. There has been opposition to vaccines in history. It\u2019s new and people are dealing with various issues. There are always a small group of people who are opposed.\u201d\n\nLegislators in France\u2019s senate debated the bill on Saturday after the lower house of parliament approved it on Friday.\n\nThe government is trying to speed up vaccination to protect vulnerable populations and hospitals and avoid new lockdowns.\n\nMost French adults are fully vaccinated and polls indicate a majority of French people support the new measures.\n\nBut not everyone. Protesters chanting \u201cLiberty! Liberty!\u201d marched through Paris in one of multiple demonstrations planned on Saturday.\n\nLast weekend, more than 100,000 people protested across France against the measures.\n\nThey included far-right politicians and activists as well as some others angry at President Emmanuel Macron for various reasons.\n\nSeparately, in Indonesia and the UK, governments have pressed ahead with the easing of restrictions even in the face of surging infections.\n\nMeanwhile, about 5,000 people demonstrated in Athens, carrying placards touting slogans such as, \u201cDon\u2019t touch our children\u201d, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.\n\nIn Sydney, demonstrators pelted officers with pot plants and bottles of water as they defied a month-long stay-at-home order, a day after authorities suggested the restrictions could remain in place until October.\n\nNew South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the protesters whose \u201cselfish actions have compromised the safety of all of us\u201d.\n\nPolice said they issued nearly 100 fines and arrested 57 people. In Melbourne, meanwhile, six people were arrested, police said.",
