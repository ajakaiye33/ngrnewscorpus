          "text": "Gombe State Government on Wednesday sent a delegation to Mariyo Primary School located in Kalshingi district, Akko Local Government Area to assess the reported educational centre, which was built with mud and had thatched roofs.\n\nThe viral images which The PUNCH had credited to TrackaNG, a community engagement platform, claimed that over 500 pupils attend the school.\n\nOur correspondent reports that there is a government-owned school, but the distance is about seven kilometres from the settlement.\n\nConfirming the assessment visit by the state government via a WhatsApp post, Information Officer at the state Ministry of Education, Saidu Malala, said that the inspection was done by the Commissioner for Education, Dauda Batari, with his information counterpart, Julius Ishaya.\n\nHe said that the delegation had useful discussions with the community, and that it was geared towards achieving positive results.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the assessment was at the instance of Governor Muhammadu Yahaya, who was disappointed by the viral images showing the quality of learning facilities in the area.\n\nThe Information Officer revealed that the inspection would usher in possible government intervention for the people of the community.\n\nRead Also\n\nMalala said, \u201cFollowing an image that has gone viral on the social media showing a classroom setting in a community in Mariyo, Kalshingi District of Akko LGA, the Commissioner for Education Dauda Zambuk; and his counterpart in information Julius Ishaya, located the primary school on assessment visit and discussed with the community with a view to securing state government intervention .\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking, Ishaya confirmed the pictures, adding that it is a community school.\n\nHe faulted the impression that the student population was 500, noting that the student size was 250.\n\nAccording to Ishaya, there are processes of taking over community schools and Gombe government is making such efforts towards taking ownership of the Mariyo Primary School.\n\n\u201cThe pictures are true, there are two huts that the community is using as classrooms. It is a community school started on 2017. It was started due to the distance from their place to the school but the Local Education Authority provided them with two teachers.\n\n\u201cTrackaNG should have verified; the number is not 500, it is 250 students and the processes is already ongoing for government to come in, because this is a community effort.\n\n\u201cWhat TrackaNG tried to portray is like government negligence or didn\u2019t pay attention. But the fact remains that there are processes and procedures for taking over community schools.\u201d",

The situation has created a dense student population in the communities.\n\nStudents protest power outage\n\nRecently, students of higher institutions and residents in the communities embarked on a peaceful protest to register their grievances against the blackout.\n\nTheir spokesperson, Oludare Akinola, disclosed that the situation has made study hectic for them and their younger ones in secondary schools around the communities.\n\nAkinola said: \u201cWe are tired of the present situation in the communities. For four months now we have not had a minute of electricity supply in any of the towns. \u201cBesides, the difficulty it subjected us to about study, living daily has become an issue. We are here to say enough is enough. Every concerned authority should, as a matter of urgency, provide a solution to the situation before it becomes a crisis.\u201d\n\nBlackout increasing insecurity\u2014Community leaders\n\nMeanwhile, leaders of the various communities in a chat with Vanguard said the four months blackout has, apart from making living difficult for residents, encourages insecurity in the affected towns.\n\nSpeaking through the President of Ipetumodu Progressive Union, Dr Sunday Oyebowale said the 7.5MVA transformer sub-station at Moro has packed up and is also no longer adequate for the populace in the areas.\n\nOyebowale said: \u201cIt is very sad and disheartening to note that communities in Ife-North Local Government Area has been experiencing total blackout for four months now and nothing has been done by Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company, IBEDC, to alleviate our problem.\n\n\u201cThe blackout has been encouraging kidnapping of people, as we know that when there is no light, it is easy to perpetrate different types of crime. The non-supply of electricity has encouraged theft in the communities. At Asipa community, a shop was looted by thieves who took advantage of the darkness; this same problem had been reported in many areas in the local government.\n\n\u201cOur economic activities have been paralysed as people using electricity for their businesses; find it very difficult to transact their businesses. This needs urgent attention so that society will not become desolate. Ife-North has been known for peace but this absence of light has made it to be a lawless society where different people just come into the Local Government unchallenged at night. Our state government and the IBEDC must make sure that positive steps are taken before things go out of hand.\n\n\u201cPeople, who deal with frozen food businesses, are suffering because there is no electricity to freeze their foods and many of them have turned to debtors due to the damage of their wares like fish, turkey and meat of all kinds. Artisans like welders, hairdressers and electricians are suffering because of a lack of electricity supply. \u201cWe have written several letters to the State Government and the IBEDC even to their main office in Ibadan but nothing has been done. We are urging people in authority and the Federal Government to stand up and assist us so that we won\u2019t continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nArtisans lament\n\nAlso lamenting, chairman of the Welders Association in Ife North, Lateef Osunshina said the blackout has completely crippled their business\n\nOsunshina said: \u201cWe have no electricity to use for our businesses. This has affected us greatly to the extent that feeding our family and other responsibilities have been difficult. Some of our members have abandoned their workshops for farming and commercial motorcycle business. We have lost millions due to this blackout. We are fed up.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the state government and the management of IBEDC to, as a matter of urgency, rescue the communities from economic difficulties\u201d.\n\nAlso, Chairman, Electronic Technicians Association in the council, Bamidele Oladele, said feeding their families has become a major challenge because they could not work due to the blackout.\n\n\u201cThis lack of electricity has affected our work in so many ways.

Consequently, he upheld a suit Kalu filed to challenge the legal propriety of his planned re-arraignment by the EFCC.\n\nKalu had in the Application he filed through his team of lawyers let by Chief Awa Kalu, SAN, argued that allowing the EFCC to try him afresh on the charge and same facts upon which he was earlier convicted and sentenced on December 5, 2019, would occasion him to suffer a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d.\n\nHURIWA however condemned the EFCC for seeking to have the same matter that was decided by the competent court of law and reached a determination that saw the former Governor going to the Kuje Prisons spending over 6 Months just before the highest Court in Nigeria the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that the judicial process that led to the sentencing of Orji Uzor Kalu to Kuje Prison was irregular and therefore ordered the immediate freedom for the erstwhile governor.\n\nHURIWA said the attempt to initiate the same case twice after the accused person had spent time in prison for same charges amounted to double jeopardy which is irregular and unconstitutional.\n\nThe Rights group, therefore, asked the EFCC to perish the thought of frittering humongous sum of public fund to chase politically motivated persecution of Kalu at the Court of Appeal.",

          "text": "By Bimbola Oyesola\n\nOrganised Labour has warned Nigerian Governors now divided under the Northern and the Southern governors against using the 2023 election from unleashing fresh dimensions of intractable and internecine security crises in Nigeria.\n\nPresident of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, who spoke during the NLC roundtable on social protection cover for workers in Abuja, yesterday cautioned political leaders, especially the Northern and the Southern governors not to take action or make statements that would polarise the country.\n\nWabba said statement from governors on the issue of power shift could cause disunity, anarchy in the country that is already tensed.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago, precisely on the 5th of July 2021, the Southern Governors Forum met in Lagos and demanded that power must go to the South in 2023. Just recently, precisely last Monday, 27th September 2021, the Northern Governors Forum met in Kaduna and made a counter demand that power must remain in the North.\n\nThe NLC President said it is indeed sad and unfortunate that the politicians find the time and nerve to discuss 2023 when 2021 presents a foreboding cloud of insecurity, social tensions and general despondency manifest in our empty kitchens, unsafe streets and overflowing IDP Camps.\n\n\u201cWe warn that such statements show utter disregard for the cruel predicament and sufferings of ordinary Nigerians and workers struggling with the pains of broken politics and governance dysfunction in our country.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections must not be used as an excuse to unleash fresh dimensions of intractable and internecine security crises in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said it was glaring that the leaders are after their own selfish interest rather than the interest of the whole country, warning that unless this is quickly addressed, there is danger every where.\n\n\u201cIt is so unfortunate that the people that are expected to unite us are the one trying to divide us. It is also very unfortunate that they are already discussing 2023 election when the challenges on ground are still enormous.\n\n\u201cWe warn that these careless statement , action by these leaders can disintegrates Nigeria. 2023 must not be used as an excuse to gain the confidence of their followers.

          "text": "\u2022Says killing inhuman, reprehensible\n\n\u2022Obiano places N20m bounty on murderers\n\n\u2022South-east govs demand arrest\n\n\u2022Region under siege, Ohaneze warns\n\n\u2022Senate observes a minute silence, as Obi expresses shock\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Joe Chukindi in Awka, Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, expressed sadness over the gruesome killing of Dr. Chike Akunyili, widower of the late former Director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Professor Dora Akunyili, and assured that his killers would not go scot-free. Buhari described the killing of Akunyili as inhuman and reprehensible, stressing that his killers would face the wrath of God and man.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was reinforced by the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who placed a N20 million bounty on the heads of Akunyili\u2019s killers.\n\nThe South-east Governors Forum also condemned the killing and demanded security agencies move quickly to arrest the perpetrators of the dastardly act and bring them to justice. In a statement by the Chairman of the Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, the forum described the killing as \u201cnot only barbaric but also unbecoming how much human lives no longer matter in our society. We give security agencies a marching order to go all out to uncover and arrest all the perpetrators of this inhuman act and make them face justice,\u201d\n\nIn its own reaction, the apex Igbo sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, raised the alarm over the incessant killing of innocent citizens in Igboland, concluding that the zone is currently under a heavy siege.\n\nThe Senate observed a minute silence for the deceased at its plenary yesterday, and a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, expressed shock at the murder of Akunyili.\n\nBuhari, in a release on Wednesday by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, shared the pain of the children, relatives, and friends of the deceased.\n\nThe president said he had fond memories of working with the late Dora Akunyili at the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) and Nigerians would never forget the memory of the amazon, who distinguished herself as a courageous, dependable and patriotic citizen.\n\nEnjoining security agencies and leaders of thought to work harder to bring an end to the violence being unleashed on innocent Nigerians, the president assured the grieving families, who lost their loved ones in the incident, that the perpetrators of the heinous act \u201cwill face both the judgement of man, and that of God.\u201d\n\nObiano placed a N20 million bounty on the heads of the killers and others, in a press release he personally signed after a meeting with heads of security agencies in the state. He implored anyone with useful information about the killing of Akunyili and other persons, who fell to the bullets of gunmen between Sunday and Tuesday, to come forward with it.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is on a very sad note that I address the state today to condemn in very strong terms, the violence that has been witnessed in Anambra in the past few days.\n\n\u201cSince last weekend, some armed persons have unleashed terror with sporadic attacks on innocent citizens in various parts of the state. From the briefings I have received from security commanders, offices of some political parties, branded campaign vehicles and individuals occupying them have been attacked with killings and burning of vehicles observed.\n\n\u201cOther innocent road users have become victims of this menace with many losing their lives and others, their properties. Between Sunday 26th and yesterday, 28th September 2021, attacks on citizens at Oko, Agulu, Obosi, Nkpor, Nnobi, Nnewi, and other places have left about 10 people dead, including an illustrious son of this state, Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Professor Dora Akunyili, who was, reportedly, gunned down yesterday around Nkpor.\n\n\u201cTo reinforce our commitment and seriousness on this issue, I, on behalf of the state government, wish to announce a twenty million naira (N20, 000,000.00) reward for any useful information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of these heinous attacks on our state.\u201d\n\nThe governor regretted the wanton killing of illustrious sons and daughters of Anambra people.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese are our own people dying every day and for what reason? Ndi Anambra, these attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now. I have, therefore, conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all security agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land.\n\n\u201cI charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same. Everything that needs to be done will be done and no stone will be left unturned in this effort. My directive to this effect is clear and I urge every security personnel on duty in Anambra State to do his utmost best to secure our people.\u201d\n\nOhaneze Ndigbo Alleges South-east Under Siege\n\nIgbo\u2019s apex sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze NdIgbo Worldwide, raised the alarm over the incessant killing of innocent citizens of the Igbo nation. Ohanaeze said the zone was currently under a heavy siege.\n\nPresident General of the organisation, Professor George Obiozor, raised the alarm during the Igbo Day Prayer Summit organised by Ohanaeze NdIgbo Worldwide, in collaboration with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East zone. Obiozor spoke against the backdrop of Dr. Chike Akunyili\u2019s murder.\n\nThe president-general, who was represented by Secretary General of Ohanaeze, Mr. Innocent Nwudenyi, stated that there was need for the people of the South-east to pause and seek the face of God, because there were too many killings in the zone lately.\n\nObiozor stated, \u201cAs we gather today to pray, we need to take a pause in Igbo Nation. We need to seek the face of God, we need to remember our brothers and sisters that have been killed over the years but more importantly, we need to think about today. The Igbo Nation is under siege; there are too many killings. Many unnecessary killings in the zone.\u201d\n\nHe described the killing of Akunyili as unfortunate, regrettable and most worrisome, pointing out that the killings in Anambra State and otherstates of the South-east have reached an alarming stage.\n\nThe Ohaneze Ndigbo president noted that something needed to be done urgently to save the South-east from the unnecessary killings. He also asked the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other groups to think deeply and take a pause.\n\n\u201cProfessor Obiozor has asked IPOB and other groups to think deeply, because if they kill every person, who will be there,\u201d Nwudenyi said. \u201cWe need to take a pause as a people and understand what is confronting us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president-general regretted that beyond the sit-at-home order, there were on-going killings from one state to another in the South-east and called on the clergy to pray fervently for the zone.\n\nIn an address, Ebonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, wondered why Igbos would be killing each other, and called for brotherly love, harmony, and peace among the Igbo.\n\nUmahi, who was represented by Secretary to the State Government and Coordinating Commissioner, Dr. Kenneth Ugballa, regretted the killing of Akunyili and noted that his death was a big blow to NdIgbo\n\nSenate Observes a Minute Silence\n\nThe Senate, Wednesday, observed a minute silence for the late Dr. Chike Akunyili, who was brutally murdered by unknown gunmen at Afor Nkpor in Anambra State on Tuesday. The moment of silence in the Red Chamber followed a point of order raised by Senator Uche Ekwunife (Anambra Central).\n\nComing under Order 43 of the Senate Standing Rules \u2013 Personal Explanation, Ekwunife noted with concern that on Tuesday, September 28, 2021, Akunyili was gunned down in a most gruesome manner at Afor Nkpor, Anambra State.\n\nAccording to Ekwunife, Chike Akunyili was till his death Medical Director of St. Leo Hospital in Enugu. She said the deceased was an established academic, medical director and one who had contributed to the development of healthcare in Nigeria.\n\nNarrating the circumstance that led to his death, Ekwunife said, \u201cDr. Akunyili went to Onitsha to present a paper and receive an award at the memorial lecture put together by a civil society organisation in honour of his late wife, Professor Dora Akunyili, and was gruesomely attacked at Nkpor on his way home.\u201d\n\nThe ranking senator also noted that lots of horrible attacks and killings had been going on across the entire South-east zone especially, Anambra, Enugu and Imo states. She urged the Inspector General of Police and heads of other law enforcement agencies to step up action towards unravelling perpetrators of the killings in Anambra State and other South-east states.\n\nEkwunife also urged governors in the South-east to rise to their responsibilities of ensuring safety of life and property of the citizens as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nObi Expresses Shock, Identifies Body in Morgue\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, expressed shock at the death of Dr Chike Akunyili, who was shot dead on Tuesday evening. Obi, who spoke to journalists, said he was in Lagos on Tuesday for some functions, and on Wednesday morning he got the news of the death of Akunyili on social media and immediately boarded a flight back to confirm it.\n\nThe former governor said, \u201cI was lucky to get the first flight, and I landed in Owerri and moved straight to Iyienu Hospital in Onitsha, where I and his son identified him in the mortuary.\n\n\u201cHe was not the only victim, there was his driver and police security aide. About nine people in all were involved in the shooting on Tuesday, and some of them were even headless, and it is now a problem identifying them.\u201d\n\nObi said the killing of Akunyili, who was a private medical practitioner, remained a great pain to him and members of Agulu community, where Obi and the late Akunyili hailed from.\n\nObi added, \u201cIt is a very sad thing to think of. If you knew Dr Akunyili, you will know that he could not hurt anyone, not here in his village and not anywhere else. He was a good man who was so happy with himself.\n\n\u201cAs for who his killers are, I can only say that no one knows. It is a very sad thing, and as I speak to you, Agulu people are in mourning.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tony Olofu, assured the people of the command\u2019s commitment to public safety.\n\nIn a press statement by the command\u2019s spokesperson, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Toochukwu Ikenga, Olofu, who had visited the scene of the incident for on-the-spot-assessment, called for collaboration between the people and the police to fish out bad elements in the state.\n\nIkenga, in the release, said, \u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Anambra State Command, CP Tony Olofu, has today, 29th September, 2021, observed with grave concern, the series of security breaches that have taken place within the state, and has, therefore, ordered tactical commanders of the command to immediately put an end to the madness.\n\n\u201cHe gave this order when he led senior police officers from the command on on-the-spot assessment to the crime scenes. The CP, while regretting the unfortunate loss of lives and valuables due to those senseless acts, has sued for calm, as the command collaborates with other security agencies in the state to decisively deal with the perpetrators, who seem to have lost every iota of human conscience and sensibility in them.\n\n\u201cHe implores members of the public, particularly, residents of the state, to continue to partner the police with a view to containing these atrocious acts, stressing that the command is more than ever determined to flush out these undesirable elements and make the entire state safer for law-abiding citizens to go about their lawful businesses.\u201d\n\nAnambra has within three days witnessed several incidents of attack by unidentified gun wielding men.\n\nPersons riding in two unmarked Sienna vehicles and a Toyota Hummer bus attacked a team of police operatives attached to the Aguata Area Command about 2pm on Tuesday, while the team was on routine patrol duty along Ezinifite/Igboukwu road. The hoodlums set the patrol vehicle ablaze and fled the scene.\n\nThere was also a gun attack on a member of the public about 5pm on the same day along Oko road. The attackers set the vehicle of the victim ablaze, leaving him with a bullet wound on his feet before escaping. About 4pm on the same day, some gunmen, in an attempt to snatch a Lexus 350 from its driver along Agulu Road, shot the owner and abandoned the victim and the car, and fled.\n\nThe incident at Nkpor, which claimed the life of Akunyili, also led to the death of about nine other persons.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants govt to wage total war on them, bomb hideouts\n\n\u2022Says their leaders should be declared wanted\n\n\u2022Gunmen kill over 43 villagers in Niger\n\n\u2022IG directs AIGs, CPs to lead security operations at independence anniversary\n\n\u2022Wike identifies lopsided appointments, injustice as cause of insecurity\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh, Juliet Akoje in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nWorried by the criminal activities of bandits in many parts of the country, the Senate, yesterday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a total war on the felons and declare them as terrorists. The Red Chamber resolved these at its Wednesday plenary. It called on Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, order the military to eliminate the bandits by bombing their hideouts.\n\nThe Senate also told the president to immediately declare all known leaders of the bandits wanted, and track them wherever they are for arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe resolutions followed the consideration of a motion on banditry in Sokoto State, sponsored by Senator Ibrahim Gobir.\n\nNonetheless, bandits, late on Tuesday, raided parts of Niger State, allegedly killing no fewer than 43 villagers. Details of how the incident happened were still sketchy at the time of filing this report due to the jamming of communication networks in the areas.\n\nBut the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, directed Assistant Inspectors-General (AIGs) in the Zonal Police Headquarters and Commissioners of Police in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to personally lead security operations across the country in order to maintain law and order during this year\u2019s independence anniversary celebration.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike identified politics of exclusion and absence of social justice as some of the causes of insecurity in the country.\n\nPresenting the motion on the floor of the Senate, Gobir lamented that Sokoto East Senatorial District had become a safe haven for bandits following a crackdown on them by the military in Zamfara State. He expressed worry that on Saturday, September 25, about 21 security men were killed in Dama and Gangara villages by rampaging bandits.\n\nAccording to the senator, out of those killed, 15 were soldiers, three mobile policemen, and three members of Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, in addition to yet to be ascertained number of civilians from the neighbouring villages.\n\nGobir stated, \u201cThis has gone to portray the seriousness of the problem, which requires concerted and urgent action by the declaration of total war on banditry.\n\n\u201cLosing such numbers of trained security personnel will further deplete the numerical strength of the security personnel we have in the country, therefore, jeopardising the security architecture of the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, most of the bandits have now relocated to Sabon Bimini and Isa local government areas due to the sustained military operations in the Zamfara axis.\n\nThe ranking senator observed that while the crackdown on the bandits was taking place in Zamfara State, no concrete measures were taken in Sokoto State to prevent a spillover from Zamfara, a situation that left the state exposed to the activities of bandits. He said the present military onslaught on the bandits was not well coordinated, stressing that it is only being orchestrated in Zamfara State, instead of all the frontline states ravaged by bandits.\n\nGobir called on the military to carry out a holistic operation on frontline states, such as Sokoto, Katsina, Niger, and Kaduna, in order to produce effective and desired results.\n\nSpeaking after the adoption of the motion, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, commended the efforts of the armed forces in the fight against insecurity in the country. While calling for increased funding for the military, Lawan charged relevant committees of the National Assembly to ensure that funds appropriated for the armed forces were judiciously applied to the purposes they were budgeted.\n\nThe senate president said, \u201cI think the issue of insecurity is one issue we will never get tired of debating here, and we must commend our armed forces and other security agencies. They give their lives in trying to secure this country, and that is the ultimate sacrifice anybody could pay. I believe that they are doing their best, but we also need to do our best as a government by giving them the kind of resources that they need.\n\n\u201cI believe we have done that in the supplementary budget, like I pointed out, but we also need to improve the annual appropriation for them. If we could pass over N800 billion in the supplementary budget, I don\u2019t see why we cannot improve the resources up to N1 trillion and then hold our security agencies accountable.\n\n\u201cI believe that we need to monitor the procurement processes when we give such kind of resources to our armed forces. The security related committees, particularly, the armed forces related committees \u2013 Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force committees \u2013 need to work very closely on the procurement processes by these services. We must ensure that funds appropriated are not put in the wrong areas, and ensure that this fight is taken to its logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe senate, accordingly, as part of its resolutions, directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other relevant federal government agencies to, as a matter of urgency, give all the necessary support to the victims of bandits in Sokoto and other parts of the country. It also observed a minute silence in honor of the fallen heroes and civilians, who lost their lives in the unwholesome activities of the bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Niger raid last night, reports had it that the bandits were escaping from the military operations in parts of Zamfara and Kaduna states when they carried out the killings. They were also said to have set some houses ablaze and kidnapped an unknown number of persons.\n\nSecretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, confirmed the story but did not give details.\n\nIn a related development in Sokoto State, three mobile policemen were reportedly killed on Tuesday, when bandits stormed Kagara town, the headquarters of Rafi Local Government Area. The marauders also kidnapped a large number of people from the Kagara market, where they first operated before ransacking the Emir\u2019s palace in the town.\n\nA source from the area told THISDAY last night that the monarch, who escaped kidnap, in company with the Commissioner for Police, was in Kagara town to assure the people that government was on top of the situation.\n\nThe SSG confirmed the death of three people in the Kagara incident\n\nBut the Inspector General of Police assured of maximum security during the independence anniversary celebrations.\n\nA police statement said the force had put in place adequate security measures to protect the citizens, ensure the success of the activities lined-up for the anniversary celebrations, and prevent any untoward situation throughout the period of the celebration and beyond.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cConsequently, the Assistant Inspectors General of Police and Commissioners of Police in all the zonal and state commands and the FCT have been directed to lead the independence anniversary security operations from the frontline.\n\n\u201cThey are to ensure high visibility and confidence boosting patrols around the venues of the celebrations, residential areas and other places of public resort to prevent any infiltration by hostile elements.\u201d\n\nThe IG pledged the unalloyed loyalty of the Nigeria Police to the sovereignty of the country as well as its unflinching commitment to combating criminality in the country and ensuring the safety of the citizenry. He called on citizenry to go about the celebrations in the most peaceful and law abiding manner, even as he appealed \u201cfor a new sense of pan-Nigerian spirit, patriotism, love and deliberate efforts by leaders at all levels at de-escalating ethnic tensions and suspicions in the land\u201d.\n\nThe IG also enjoined the citizenry to continue to cooperate with the police and other security agencies in fighting crimes and criminality in the country.\n\nWike, who blamed politics of exclusion as well as the absence of social justice for insecurity in the country, also accused the federal government of failing to provide \u201cresponsible governance\u201d that could promote sustainable governance. The governor spoke in Abuja at a lecture delivered at the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS), titled, \u201cGovernance, Security and Sustainable Development in Africa, Nexus, Challenges and Prospects: Rivers State as a Metaphor.\u201d He took a swipe at those opposed to power shift, saying they are promoting injustice.\n\nThe lecture was delivered to the participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course (EIMC 14), who were rounding-off their study at the NISS, preparatory to the award of the fellow of the security institute.\n\nWike stated, \u201cWhat we have today cannot be said to be a responsive government that will provide all these. What we are hearing is excuse one, excuse two. It is terrible. So, if you don\u2019t have a responsive governance, you will not have environmental sustainability, because it requires good governance.\n\n\u201cA sense of social justice, equity is fundamental to achieving peace, security and sustainable development, which only good governance can achieve. You cannot have this if you do not have good governance and you cannot talk about sustainable development when you don\u2019t have good governance. It is practically impossible.\n\n\u201cThus, among other structural and infrastructural variables, nothing can be more relevant to the progress of society than the practice of good governance, led by visionary, effective and transformational leadership as essential precondition for effective democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, and enhancing the living conditions of ordinary people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, poor governance and bad leadership model continue to characterise Africa\u2019s political, economic, security and social landscapes.\u201d\n\nHe said those who held that zoning was unconstitutional were promoting inequity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI am sorry, people forget, when people say zoning is unconstitutional, but you know what is called equity. Equity brings peace. Let everybody be part of it. But the moment you begin to think that this is your own exclusivity, that nobody else, then it becomes a crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you begin to see some people, to deny them certain things, that will lead to insecurity and with insecurity, you cannot achieve sustainable development. Take, for example, when the Igbo are crying to say, look, in appointment, you don\u2019t recognise us, what is wrong in listening to them?\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong in sitting back and saying, look, we are all one, we want this country to be together in order for us to achieve sustainable development? Because, if you don\u2019t include them, some of them will begin to believe that they are not part of the system.\u201d\n\nWike recalled Buhari\u2019s position on sections of the country that did not vote for him, saying, \u201cNow, take for example, with all due respect, when Mr. President said ninety-something per cent of whatever will go to only those who voted for him, that alone will create crisis.\n\n\u201cThat is not part of good governance. I don\u2019t expect the president of a country to say, \u2018I will only remember those who voted for me\u2019. That is not democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says they\u2019re only against language used by southern colleagues\n\n\u2022SaMBA claims north\u2019s position can inflame succession agitation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Emameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday, clarified the position of the northern governors over the power shift controversy, saying his colleagues in the north never opposed the presidency going to the south in 2023, but were only against the language used by their southern colleagues.\n\nThis is as the Southern and Middle-Belt Alliance (SaMBA), has described as inflammatory, the resolution of the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) over power rotation, saying such statement was capable of fuelling secessionist agitations in the country.\n\nThe Northern Governors Forum, in a communiqu\u00e9 read by their chairman and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, after their emergency meeting, had said: \u201cThe Forum observed that some northern states governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three Geo-Political Zone in the south to promote unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemn the statement by the Southern Governor\u2019s Forum that the presidency must go to the south. The statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected president shall:-score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation. In the case of run-up, simple majority wins the election.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the back and forth between governors of the two regions had elicited concerns as well as reactions from other stakeholders from both ends, suggesting obnoxious scenarios in the two regions.\n\nBut El-Rufai, on Wednesday, clarified the resolution of the governors and said they were alarmed that their southern counterparts could use the word \u201cmust\u201d in their agitation for power shift to the south after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure in 2023.\n\nThe North West governor stated that the word \u201cmust\u201d was at variance with democracy, which was characterised by negotiations and horse-trading by parties involved, often out of the public glare.\n\nAccording to him, he and some other northern governors had earlier called for a power shift in 2023 in their individual capacities to foster national unity and togetherness, adding that \u201che was called names by his people for making that call.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai, who made the clarifications in a media chat with select Kaduna-based broadcast journalists on Tuesday night, pointed out that the media misrepresented the resolution of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum meeting which held on Monday, on power shift.\n\nAlthough he spoke in Hausa, the Kaduna governor reminded the south that, \u201cThe north has supported southern presidential aspirants in the past\u201d, adding that they \u201csupported Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s aspiration in 1999 and his re-election in 2003.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai was of the view that their southern colleagues should have reached out to them on the issue of power shift instead of playing to the gallery.\n\nReacting too to the development, SaMBA in a statement by its spokesman, Rwang Pam Jnr., emphasised that though there was no express provision for zoning in the Constitution, Section 14(3) explicitly provides for distribution of offices in the composition of government in the country and therefore disapproves of any attempt by any region to dominate other regions.\n\nSaMBA, therefore, warned the Northern Governors Forum that any further attempt to want to retain power in 2023 would defeat the purpose of a united Nigeria, where every man and region\u2019s right to rule was equal and would endanger the already fragile unity of the country.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cThe recent statement credited to the Northern Governors Forum that power shift is unconstitutional, is an attempt to stand history on its head and could fuel separatist agitations in the country.\n\n\u201cThe section of the Constitution referenced by the Northern Governors only refers to the requirements for someone to be declared as elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but the relevant constitutional provision for power rotation is section 14(3), which explicitly provides for the spread of political offices in the country to prevent one ethnic group or region from dominating the others for the sake of peace and unity in the country.\n\n\u201cSection 14(3) states: The composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or in any of its agencies.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and a danger to the unity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the core North to spend eight years in office and still be thinking of seeking another eight years.\n\n\u201cNigerians are aware, that after former President Olusegun Obasanjo completed his 8-year term in 2007, the south unanimously agreed for the Northern Nigeria to produce the President. In 2007, the South did not cry that zoning is unconstitutional, and President Obasanjo duly handed over Power to a northerner, the late former President Umaru Ya\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cIt is also public knowledge that former President Goodluck Jonathan lost the 2015 Presidential election to President Muhammadu Buhari partly, because of the global sentiment, that it was the turn of the North to produce the President, even though Dr Goodluck Jonathan had only spent one term in office as elected president.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is not in the interest of the country for the North to hold onto power in 2023,because doing so will be to the detriment of the already fragile unity of the country and more likely to lead to an increase of separatist movements across the country. The position of the Middle Belt Region is categorically clear; that it agrees with the rest of Nigerians, that the South should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, unequivocally advise the Northern Governors Forum to perish the thought of holding onto power in 2023 and the same applies to the various political parties (APC, PDP, or any other party) to bury the thought of zoning the Presidency to the North.\n\n\u201cWe further advise the governors of the 15 states, where the middle belt ethnic nationalities constitute the dominant population, that any governor from the Middle Belt that supported the notion that power should remain with the Northern region is not reflecting the views of their peoples,\u201d the group insisted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "As senate moves to stop illegal charges on cargo transport\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has written formally to the Senate requesting to replace the nomination of Engr. Sarki Auwalu as the Chief Executive Officer on the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) board.\n\nThis is just as the Red Chamber moved on Wednesday to stop illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe President\u2019s request was contained in a letter dated September 28, 2021, and read at Wednesday plenary by the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan.\n\nThe President had in an earlier letter dated September 16, 2021, requested the upper chamber to confirm Auwalu alongside three others as board members of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nIn his new request, President Buhari is, however, asking for the approval of the Senate to replace\n\nSarki Auwalu with Engr. Farouk A. Ahmed as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHe explained that the replacement request was duly in accordance with the provision of Section 34(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Red Chamber commenced moves to stop processing delay and illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe decision to end multiple charges on cargo processing and transport was reached by the upper chamber in a resolution, following consideration of a motion during plenary.\n\nThe motion tilted: \u201cThe need to streamline Import and Export Cargo Processing in the Aviation Sector\u201d was sponsored by Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah.\n\nRising under Order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, Na\u2019Allah noted with dismay the loss of about N250 billion on agro-export of produce in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the loss which translates to a ratio of 87:13 continues to impact negatively on the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNa\u2019Allah noted that there are about 16 sundry charges for goods coming in or out of the country \u2013 with 16 in Lagos and 15 in Abuja \u2013 and many of them being unofficial and illegal.\n\nHe lamented that loading 100 tons of cargo on aircraft cost around $35,000 in Nigeria, compared to Ghana that cost just about $4000 USD.\n\nThe ranking Senator said: \u201cThis has caused substantial damage to the Federal Government efforts of stimulating Capital Inflow\u201d, adding that, \u201cairlines involved in cargo transport have started avoiding Nigeria in view of the prohibitive charges.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, mandated the Joint Committees on Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Aviation and Customs to invite stakeholders and Freight Agents to come with acceptable template of processing Nigeria\u2019s Imports and Exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for the confirmation of Engr. Mohammed Sani Baba, representing Bauchi State as Federal Commissioner in the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, to the Committee on National Planning and Economic Affairs.\n\nThe Committee is expected to screen the nominee and report back to the upper chamber in two weeks.\n\nAlso, the President\u2019s request for the confirmation of five nominees as Commissioners in the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission was referred to the Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes.\n\nThe nominees for screening include: Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, Ekiti (South-West); Mrs. Anne Otelafu Odey, Cross River (South-South); Alh. Goni Ali Gujba, Yobe (North-East); Dr. Louis Solomon Mandama, Adamawa (North-East); and Senator Anthony O. Agbo (Ebonyi).\n\nThe Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes Committee also has two weeks to screen the nominees and report back to the Senate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "summary": "A French court Thursday imposed a one-year sentence on former president Nicolas Sarkozy after finding him guilty of illegal campaign financing for massive overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign.\nFormer French President, SarkozySarkozy, who spent nearly twice the legal limit on his failed bid for a second term in office, wasn't present at the Paris court for the announcement of the verdict.\nProsecutors had sought a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the former president.\nThe verdict is not the same as a suspended sentence, as it goes down in his record as a full prison term.\nProsecutors have requested mostly suspended prison sentences, and up to one year in prison for Bygmalion's co-founder.",

A war that earned him a bullet that stayed lodged in his skull ever since. From this experience of violence and death, he went on to become a doctor saving thousands of lives \u2014 a powerful testament to his journey through life.\n\n\u201cHe was a loving husband. It is no surprise that, on the day of his untimely death, he was on his way from a memorial lecture in honour of his late wife, who he cherished and honoured even in death. At this event and always, he invited everyone to be like his wife Dora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was a father and grandfather. With joy, he would share that he was a grandfather to 9 grandchildren. He welcomed his youngest grandchild just a little over a month ago and had yet to meet her.\n\n\u201cHe was an older brother to all his siblings, many of whom call him Daddy in reverence and recognition of his love.\n\n\u201cHe was a healer. A passionate surgeon, Dr Chike was the Medical Director at St. Leo\u2019s Hospital in Enugu. For decades he served countless people, many of whom he cared for and healed at no cost. His one request was always that they paid it forward.\n\n\u201cHe started his healing journey in the north where he built and ran a mobile clinic in Jaban Kogo. For many months, he lived and worked among the people, studying and becoming fluent in Hausa to better serve his patients. His commitment to providing healthcare to that community earned him the National Youth Service Merit Award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was a philanthropist. For 45 years he treated priests in Bigard Memorial Seminary and beyond for free, trusting this to be his calling.\n\n\u201cHe was a Papal Knight of Saint John, a title bestowed by the Vatican in recognition of his dedication and service to the Church.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of the people, loved by many for his wisdom and for his courage to always speak the truth. His counsel was sought far and wide.\n\n\u201cHe is remembered for his ability to hold an audience captive with his words and stories. To hear him speak in Igbo was to be blessed by the wisdom of endless proverbs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was an ordinary man who, every day, showed his extraordinary commitment to his community and his people by his ability to help people in need without question.\n\n\u201cIn his final days, his heart was heavy about the state of things in Nigeria. He lamented about the struggles of people unable to pay for treatment anymore and about the unfortunate state of unrest where human life had lost its value.\n\n\u201cHis hope echoed that of his beloved wife and our mother, that Nigeria might lean on the forces of unity and shun disunity. That we might do the right thing, trusting that our potential lies in the goodness of the people and the greatness of the nation.\u201d",

          "title": "LoftyInc, early investor in Andela, doesn\u2019t play by the rules of VC investing",
          "text": "\u201cOh God of creation, direct our noble cause\n\nGuide our leaders right\n\nHelp our youth the truth to know\n\nIn love and honesty to grow\n\nAnd living just and true\n\nGreat lofty heights attain\n\nTo build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.\u201d\n\nForty-three years ago, this version of the Nigerian national anthem (second stanza) was created. Like many other Nigerians, Idris Bello and Michael Oluwagbemi grew up singing it, not knowing that a line from the anthem would later inspire the name for their future pan-African venture capital firm, LoftyInc Capital Management.\n\nThe journey of LoftyInc started about 10 years ago with a simple desire to help young Africans turn lofty ideas into global corporations that would create high-impact jobs and transcend development challenges.\n\nIn 2010, Bello and Oluwagbemi were engineers working in the US and met after an interview on entrepreneurship Bello had granted during a visit to Nigeria. Upon realizing they had the same idea and could do more together, they decided to partner.\n\n\u201cWhen we decided to start supporting businesses, we didn\u2019t know how to go about it,\u201d Bello said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any template or roadmap. We just knew we wanted to create more jobs and prosperity for people, and we set out to do something.\u201d\n\nBack then, the popular way to support businesses was through innovation hubs. The duo looked to iHub in Kenya, YCombinator in the US and a few hubs in Houston for inspiration.\n\nThe solution they arrived at was what birthed the Wennovation Hub, a place where people could gather to collectively solve the common problems they faced. The approach then was to bring people together to talk about the problems they faced in their different sectors, with the hope that they\u2019d figure out the right questions and solutions.\n\nAlong the way, they noticed that after talking about the problems and stumbling on solutions, the ideas needed funding to take off. This led the duo on a long and experimental expedition to build what is now known as LoftyInc Capital Management.\n\nToday, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella. It recently launched its third $10 million fund.\n\nIdris Bello with Rasha and Doa of Chefaa, Egypt\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did LoftyInc Capital Management start?\n\nIdris Bello: Michael and I met because we shared a similar interest in solving problems in Africa. We aligned on a clear belief that entrepreneurship is the answer.\n\nThe turning point for us was in 2011 when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had a programme called Accelerating Information Technology Initiative (AITI). This programme involved sending coders (they weren\u2019t called developers back then) to teach people at the University of Ibadan programming. We heard about this and said we\u2019d partner with MIT on the business side of things by working with the persons trained in programming to bring some of their ideas to life. The first set of startups we invested in came from this programme.\n\nIt was while working on the business aspect that we realized these businesses also need money to run.\n\nSo we decided to look back home. We decided to pool funds from different people (angel investors). I remember sending the first email to Tomi Davies and other industry leaders to form what has now become the Lagos Angel Network. Kudos to Tomi Davies and others who have done an amazing job building that up to form the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nAfter a while, we noticed that it took too long to invest in the startups. Back then LAN used to invest in companies twice a year. By the time we were done with due diligence six months down the line after committing to invest, the companies were probably dead.\n\nSo I said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t sustainable. We need to start investing on a more frequent basis.\u201d Michael and I took out money from our 401k (retirement savings) to invest. It was a risky move because we weren\u2019t supposed to touch the money until we were 59 years old.\n\nWe also got other people to start the Afropreneurs Angel Group, a group of angel investors, who invested on a more frequent basis. Notably, the first investment we made from here was in Hutbay, a startup that recently shut down. We went on to invest in more startups that mostly died, but fortunately, a few that survived, like Andela and Flutterwave, have compensated for the ones that died.\n\nWhile we were investing via the Afropreneurs Angel Group, our long time advisor Masha Wulff (a veteran US investor), suggested that we set up a proper VC fund. We were at first reluctant because we didn\u2019t set out to become venture capitalists. In fact, if you were to ask me 4-5 years ago about the normal things that a VC or investment banker should know, I didn\u2019t know them.\n\nBut Wulff was persistent and we gave in. This incentivized her to decide to come out of retirement to be a general partner for Fund 2, committing $500,000 of her own money to the fund. We ended up raising a little over $1 million and further invested in six companies \u2014 Printivo, RelianceHMO, Epump, YouVerify, Shyft Power Solutions and Flutterwave (at pre-Series A).\n\nIdris Bello, Michael Oluwagbemi and Masha Wulff\n\nDA: What\u2019s your approach to investing in startups?\n\nIB: In early-stage investing, founders are crucial, so we believe in backing good founders. We believe that good founders will always find a way. It\u2019s not necessarily about the business model, because startups often pivot.\n\nI remember telling Iyin Aboyeji early on when I was investing in his first venture that even if he doesn\u2019t return my money, he should take it as payment for his MBA. Fortunately, he\u2019s given us great returns on the many investments we made. I say this to point out that the way I see it is we\u2019re investing in the ecosystem. So even if a company fails, the founders and employees can go on to work at other startups and go on to build the African tech ecosystem.\n\nWe use our experience at the launch and early growth phases to closely support and assist new and early founders. We often help to source and secure their initial clients from within our large portfolio (over 75 African startups) or further afield within our large African-based Angel and Limited Partner (LP) network. We provide meaningful introductions to regulators, partners, mentors, top hires and experienced board directors.\n\nWhile we\u2019re sector-agnostic, we have 6 thematic areas of focus: Commerce, Financial logistics, Food security, Health/Wellbeing, and Education. We believe businesses in these areas help spur the general prosperity of a nation and people at large.\n\nIdris and Michael with Kabiru of Sudo\n\nDA: Tell me about notable deals missed or mistakes made?\n\nIB: Oh sure! Those are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\nMost of the mistakes we made were a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 check. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\n\nWhen I look back at these mistakes, it was easier to get through because we used our personal money in the early days and we weren\u2019t crazy about exits. We did what we did because we believed supporting businesses was the way to solve Africa\u2019s problems. And today, when we see startups like Andela employing thousands of people in emerging markets, and impacting lives globally, we feel very fulfilled. People returns, then money returns. That is the goal!\n\nIdris Bello with Jeremy Johnson of Andela\n\nDA: I remember earlier this year you spoke online about a bad experience with a founder. How often do those happen, and can you share any experiences?\n\nIB: That\u2019s right, there are bad experiences and it\u2019s important to share them. These days all that\u2019s shared are the success stories, which is only half of the picture.\n\nWithout mentioning any names, we\u2019ve had a situation where some founders disappeared after getting $5,000 investment only to show up after 3 years begging for forgiveness. Small money, but I guess they had more pressing needs.\n\nThere\u2019s one startup that recently shut down primarily because the CEO relocated permanently to Canada without carrying us along, yet refused to let go of leadership. They\u2019d blame it on COVID but it wasn\u2019t COVID.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019d like to say that in this space, we have no issues with startups not working out, but then what\u2019s more important is that the founder communicates well and operates with integrity.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits?\n\nIB: When it comes to early-stage investing, my belief is that a bird in hand is the only bird. The tides can change for any company, so the only thing that\u2019s certain is money received based on exit, not expected return based on valuation. Earlier this year, our Fund 2 exited Flutterwave and returned 3x of total funds raised to our limited partners (LPs). Some people felt it was too soon and we should have waited. But the way I look at it, it\u2019s necessary to return funds to the backers of early-stage funds to boost their confidence. For a 5-year fund, in just three years, we returned 3x. The result of this was that these LPs were so impressed that they pressured us for a new fund and made commitments of over $4m to get it started.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note here that we don\u2019t play by the \u201crules\u201d. Every now and then, we ask ourselves, \u201cWho created the rules that you have to wait 5 years or that you have to return 10x the investment?\u201d For me, as long as my LPs are happy and the startups are doing fine, I\u2019m okay. It is still Day 1 in the African early-stage investment space and we are all learning as we go. VC Investing in Africa is still nascent and we\u2019re all still figuring it out. There are no experts.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing?\n\nIB: For me, there are three things I\u2019m bullish about going forward. The first is bringing Egyptian and Nigerian companies together. These are two of Africa\u2019s largest markets. I believe there should be more collaboration, considering that Egypt has a matured stock market and Nigeria has many notable startups. I believe this type of collaboration will bring about more mergers and acquisitions. It\u2019ll help create a secondary market for investors to exit.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019m excited about is investing outside of the Big Four \u2014 Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt. We\u2019ve recently invested in a Zambian startup and are doubling down on investing in Francophone African countries. We like to stay ahead of the curve. Egypt is hot right now, but I remember a few years ago when I started investing in Egypt, I was telling people to do the same and it looked like I was insane.\n\nIdris Bello with Yaw Bediako of Yemaachi\n\nFinally, as many people \u201cjapa\u201d (exit) the continent in search of greener pastures in the West, it\u2019s expected that some of them will go on to start businesses. We\u2019re keeping our eyes on the diaspora market.\n\nOne of my biggest joys over the past few years has been the large number of senior African executives and experienced operators we\u2019ve turned into investors, either as angel investors or LPs. These African investors then spend lots of their time helping us with due diligence and supporting our portfolio companies. Again, this is all part of building the African tech ecosystem: activating Africans to fund Africans solving African problems.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Andela, a global engineering talent outsourcing company, has secured $200 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series E funding round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, the venture capital arm of Japanese conglomerate \u2013 SoftBank.\n\nThis funding round brings the total venture funding raised by Andela to $380 million. Alongside Softbank, the round included Whale Rock, a new investor and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Spark Capital.\n\n\u201cAndela has always been the high-quality option for those building remote engineering teams. Now that the world has come to embrace remote work, Andela has become the obvious choice for companies because we can find better talent, faster,\u201d said Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela. \u201cIf you are a talented engineer, Andela opens up a world of possibilities for you, no matter where you are based.\u201d\n\nIn view of this announcement, Lydia Jett, Founding Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and one of the most respected consumer technology investors in the world, will join Andela\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology. Two years after it launched the company got a $24 million infusion, led by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who followed up with a visit.\n\nL \u2013 R: Brice Nkengsa, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Ian Carnevale, Christina Sass, Jeremy Johnson, and Nadayar Enegesi co-founded Andela in September 2014. Image credit: Andela\n\nIn July 2020, Andela changed its model, closing its physical offices in Nigeria, Uganda and Rwanda to become a fully remote company. The particular rationale at the time was to increase the number of Africans who could apply to work for the company as software developers. Almost a year later, it expanded its talent pool to welcome Latin and South American developers.\n\nToday, the company boasts of a network of engineers from more than 80 countries and six continents. Through Andela, thousands of engineers have been placed with leading technology companies including Github, Cloudflare and ViacomCBS.\n\n\u201cHiring remote technical talent is one of the top challenges that companies face today. We believe Andela will become the preferred talent partner for the world\u2019s best companies as remote and hybrid work arrangements become the norm,\u201d Lydia Jett said. \u201cWe are delighted to support Jeremy and the Andela team in their mission to connect these companies with brilliant engineers, and in the process, unlock human potential at scale.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Researchers at a new bionics centre established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plan to pilot a mobile imaging and delivery system of prosthetic limb services for disabled Sierra Leoneans.\n\nThe project \u2013 meant to ensure patients in medically underserved communities have access to prostheses \u2013 is listed as one of the four priorities for the research centre set up with $24 million in funding from philanthropist Lisa Yang.\n\nA statement released by MIT reveals that investigators will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customized prosthetics to disabled individuals.\n\nThe service will initially roll out in rural Sierra Leone, a West African country where thousands of people suffered amputations during an 11-year civil war. According to estimates, roughly 27,000 Sierra Leoneans were disabled or had one or more of their limbs amputated during the 1991-2002 war.\n\nMIT adds that while the population of people with amputated limbs continues to increase each year in Sierra Leone, less than 10% of that population currently benefits from functional prostheses.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThrough the mobile delivery system, a key centre objective is to scale up production and access of functional limb prostheses for Sierra Leoneans in dire need,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nSierra Leone President, Julius Maada Bio, describes the mobile prosthetics service fueled by the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics as \u201can innovative solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nThe MIT project aligns with President Bio\u2019s plans to make Sierra Leone a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the first things he did after assuming office in 2017 was set up a Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) led by David Moinina Sengeh, the country\u2019s first-ever chief innovation officer who doubles as the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education.\n\nSengeh is an MIT and Harvard inventor whose research work to improve prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone will be leveraged by the MIT bionics centre.\n\nA crucial figure in the government\u2019s digitisation drive, he\u2019s introduced President Bio to TED Talks and tech activities at the universities of Oxford, Yale, and Harvard.\n\nOver the past four years, the President has participated in dialogues centered around using innovation and technology to transform food systems in Africa; given presentations on blockchain and the fourth industrial revolution; as well as visited MIT, where he detailed plans to make his nation a digital centre.\n\n\u201cI am proud that Sierra Leone will be the first site for deploying this state-of-the-art digital design and fabrication process,\u201d Bio said.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a government that promotes innovative technologies and prioritizes human capital development, I am overjoyed that this pilot project will give Sierra Leoneans (especially in rural areas) access to quality limb prostheses and thus improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nMore on the bionics centre\n\nThe K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics will be run by Hugh Herr, an MIT professor and double amputee. Broadly, it aims to develop technologies and surgical methods to mitigate disability because of injury, aging, or disease using interdisciplinary research.\n\nExperts from three MIT schools \u2013 Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Planning \u2013 as well as clinical and surgical collaborators at Harvard Medical School, are expected to work together at the new centre.\n\nFurthermore, the center will provide four endowed fellowships for MIT graduate students working in bionics or other research areas focused on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe new K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, made possible by a US$24 million gift from philanthropist Lisa Yang (center), will be led by Hugh Herr, professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab (left), and Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT (right). Image source: MIT News\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to support MIT on this major research effort to enable powerful new solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals who experience disability,\u201d said Yang, a former investment banker and a major supporter in autism research at MIT and Cornell University, among other institutions.\n\n\u201cThis new commitment extends my philanthropic investment into the realm of physical disabilities, and I look forward to the centre\u2019s positive impact on countless lives.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It looks that way, but Ekekwe calls it an investment syndicate. He rejects the VC fund label because it increases ticket sizes and could result in worrying about big exits.\n\nOur reporter, Chimgozirim Nwokoma, chatted with Ekekwe about how Tekedia Capital works and his views on building Africa\u2019s future.\n\nRead here: This is the time to build the architecture for Africa\u2019s future \u2013 Ndubuisi Ekekwe on funding startups in Africa\n\nWriting difficulties and the role of dysgraphia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we write, a lot of complex processing goes on in the brain.\n\nFrom illegible handwriting to slow writing and spelling troubles, dysgraphia affects an individual\u2019s writing ability in varying degrees.\n\nWriting on its own is very complex, but combined with dysgraphia, some people might find it difficult to hold a pencil or pen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Victoria Fakiya walks us through the life of nine-year-old Henry and his struggle with dysgraphia.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a child, Ndubuisi Ekekwe realised that excelling in his education was a guaranteed path to influence. That realisation drove him to apply himself, eventually resulting in him studying electrical and electronics engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at various companies, including Diamond Bank and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) before moving to the US where he obtained a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Subsequently, he taught at Carnegie Mellon University before founding companies operating in the technology space.\n\nIn December 2020, Professor Ekekwe published an article on the Tekedia website, which he titled, \u201cFintechnolization of Platforms \u2013 Expect this Redesign in Startups.\u201d In the article, he argued that every digital platform would have to offer a financial service at some point if it must capture massive value.\n\nIn January 2021, he launched Tekedia Capital, an investment syndicate that allows individuals to invest in companies operating largely in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I made that postulation, I thought, \u2018if I have written this, how do I demonstrate that I\u2019m walking the talk?\u2019 So, that is how I started thinking about building our fintech solution within our ecosystem since, to a large extent, we have a couple of thousands of people here. That was how Tekedia Capital came about.\u201d\n\nStarting Tekedia Capital was not just about making money though. It was also driven by a desire to support a generation of African entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cI will say, to a large extent, that I am optimistic about this Cambrian moment of entrepreneurial capitalism in Africa. That this is the time to build the architecture for the new African future and having the right capital will make sure that the entrepreneurs will be successful in doing that.\u201d\n\nEkekwe is quick to point out that Tekedia Capital is not a VC fund but an investment syndicate. On the reason for choosing this model, he points out that becoming a VC fund increases ticket sizes and could result in worrying about big exits, adding that investing smaller amounts improves the chance of being bought out by bigger investors at subsequent raises.\n\nWith most members of the syndicate being angel investors, this flexibility is key.\n\n\u201cMost people who are still investing at a personal level want to have that flexibility but VCs may like it to get very big.\u201d\n\nEven with this, the firm does not invest less than $70,000 in startups, often going as high as $700,000.\n\nHow Tekedia Capital works\n\nWith an annual fee of $1,000, or its local equivalent, investors get access to Tekedia Capital\u2019s deal flow for four investment cycles or 12 months in situations where Tekedia Capital does not have up to four investment cycles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor investors in the syndicate, the minimum investment in a startup is $10,000 or its local equivalent. In addition to the $1,000 required to gain access, Tekedia Capital charges a 20% carried interest of the invested amount.\n\nSince its launch, the syndicate has invested in up to ten startups, including Y Combinator portfolio company, Mecho Autotech; on-demand helicopter booking startup Vetifly; and online checkout startup, OurPass. Investments in startups are determined by members of the syndicate and not Tekedia Capital.\n\nIt operates a lean model with a small team that sources and vets deals before presenting them to the syndicate\u2019s members.\n\nMembers of the syndicate come from various professional backgrounds, and this means that Tekedia Capital can get professional advice from someone with experience in a sector before investing.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nTekedia Capital invests in early-stage technology-anchored startups with most of their operations based in Africa. It is also sector-agnostic although there is a bias towards startups that are hard to automate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a company that someone in Silicon Valley will automate. So, you\u2019re not going to see us invest in businesses like Twitter or Instagram because there is no inherent geographical advantage that it gives you as an innovator in Lagos. You have to be physically present.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Ekekwe discloses that the syndicate picks startups with teams that show the required technical and managerial abilities. The team must also be able to go beyond customer acquisition to making fans of their customers.\n\nIn my conversations with early-stage investors, a common thought expressed is how there is very little data available on a startup that could aid the due diligence process and so in many cases, the decision on whether to invest in a startup could come down to the founder.\n\nEkekwe reveals that beyond a founder\u2019s technical or managerial capabilities, it is important to know what motivates the person.\n\n\u201cI like to know our startup founders. I don\u2019t want to invest in someone whose motivations I don\u2019t understand. I just want to know if this is a guy that will stop picking calls if you send him $300,000 so we put significant effort into trying to understand exactly who our founders are.\u201d\n\nFounders who meet Tekedia Capital\u2019s requirements can apply for investment by sending an email to capital@fasmicro.com.\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s future\n\nAfrica still suffers a huge infrastructural deficit and the capital required to plug the hole means that only a few entrepreneurs would bother with it. Ekekwe understands this and points out that despite the growth experienced by software startups, those are not the innovations that would ultimately drive Africa\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity in Africa today is building infrastructure but they don\u2019t bring in a lot of money. We need to build seaports, better broadband in rural communities, a better logistics system that will make eCommerce work, and we also need electricity that works. These are the infrastructure that power innovation but you don\u2019t expect small VCs or entrepreneurs to deal with that. However, those are the things that will facilitate Africa\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding that entrepreneurs cannot be expected to drive this growth, he expressed hope that as more exits are recorded in the startup scene, more founders will be willing to take on projects of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry*, a 9-year-old student, was diagnosed with dysgraphia when he was seven years old. He has trouble gripping a pencil, which always leads to hand cramps and fatigue.\n\n\u201cHenry\u2019s handwriting was unusual and inconsistent. It was sad to see him struggle to write at home because it seemed like his teachers were punishing him by having him write in class,\u201d Henry\u2019s dad recalls.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), writing necessitates a complex set of motor and information processing skills which includes the ability to organise thoughts coherently and then write them down on paper.\n\nHowever, dysgraphia impairs these abilities in varying degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPrior to the diagnosis, I had received numerous reports from his teachers indicating that my son was lazy and unable to write. They advised me to withdraw him. But Henry was a natural communicator. He could speak and express himself clearly in words. I knew something was wrong. So, in 2019, I took him for diagnosis,\u201d his dad says.\n\nDysgraphia is a neurological condition that impairs writing and fine motor skills. It is a learning disability that affects both children and adults, and it affects almost every aspect of the writing process, including spelling, legibility, word spacing, and sizing.\n\nLiving with dysgraphia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDysgraphia is a condition that has received little attention from researchers globally. As a result, estimating the prevalence of dysgraphia is difficult.\n\nHowever, according to research, Dr Reynold Cecil Randy, an American psychology professor, estimates that the prevalence of dysgraphia ranges from 5 to 20% in the world. Besides, men are more likely to suffer from dysgraphia than women.\n\nTypically, dysgraphia appears when children are first introduced to writing. Despite thorough instruction, they write incorrectly sized and spaced letters or misspell words, resulting in poor handwriting.\n\nNevertheless, dysgraphia may remain unnoticed from childhood until adulthood.\n\nWhen dysgraphia appears in childhood, it is usually due to a problem with orthographic coding.\n\nThe International Dyslexia Association (IDA), a non-profit education and advocacy organisation devoted to issues surrounding dyslexia, describes orthographic coding as the ability to store written words in working memory while the letters in words are analysed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IDA also describes it as the ability to form long-term memories of written words associated with their pronunciation and meaning.\n\nAdditionally, children with dysgraphia do not have a primary developmental motor disorder, another cause of poor handwriting. Nonetheless, they may struggle to plan sequential finger movements without visual feedback, such as touching the thumb to successive fingers on the same hand.\n\nAccording to a study, students with dysgraphia may struggle to learn, complete coursework, communicate, record ideas, demonstrate knowledge, and keep up with their peers and teachers\u2019 instructions.\n\nThis can also cause or exacerbate emotional, academic, and social development deficits in students, as well as \u201cimpact factors like self-efficacy, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, all of which are linked to educational motivation, achievement, and persistence.\u201d\n\nIn adults, it is most prevalent following a traumatic event and is usually associated with damage to the brain\u2019s parietal lobe.\n\nIndividuals with dysgraphia frequently use incorrect words to convey their message. For instance, instead of saying \u201cchild,\u201d they say \u201cboy.\u201d\n\nEven so, children with dysgraphia may have good oral skills, but they may be misunderstood as lazy and uninterested or indifferent because they cannot write.\n\nIn summary, dysgraphia makes it difficult for children and adults to plan and execute a sentence, words, or even letters in writing. Therefore, it\u2019s not as if individuals with dysgraphia can\u2019t read, spell, or recognise letters and words. It\u2019s just that their brains struggle to process words and write.\n\nSo, it is critical to understand that dysgraphia is a neurological disorder, not a cognitive impairment.\n\nRelationship between dysgraphia and dyslexia\n\nDysgraphia was initially grouped with dyslexia until 1936 when Anna Gillingham \u2014 an educator and psychologist best known for her contributions to the Orton-Gillingham method of teaching dyslexic children to read \u2014 led a series of workshops on reading, spelling, and handwriting, according to a study.\n\nDyslexia and dysgraphia are language-based disorders. However, while dyslexia affects reading, dysgraphia affects writing.\n\nMoreso, both disabilities make it difficult for people to convert phonemes (sounds) into graphemes (letters in written form). That is, they affect the ability to spell.\n\nAccording to Lexercise, a Structured Language Therapy programme based on the Orton Gillingham methodology for children with learning disabilities, language disorders can occur independently or in conjunction with other problems.\n\nTherefore, dysgraphia can coexist with other learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nAssistive technology for Dysgraphia\n\nSome beneficial assistive technologies (AT) can help students and adults with dysgraphia access information and demonstrate what they know in writing.\n\nA study by the University of Washington shows that finding a set of appropriate AT tools and techniques for a specific individual may necessitate some trial and error.\n\nTherefore, a person with a learning disability should be involved in the selection of their technology. They should assist in determining what works for them.\n\nHere are five AT tools that can be tested, discarded, adapted or refined by students with dysgraphia.\n\n1. Pencil Grips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Consortium\n\nDesigned in 1992 by Dr Lois Provda, an educational therapist, the Pencil Grip is used extensively in classrooms, homes, and therapeutic settings.\n\nPencil Grips are small attachments that are placed at the end of a pencil. They assist a child in grasping a pencil practically and accurately.\n\nWhen used correctly, a Pencil Grip can help develop fine motor skills and handwriting control. Its distinctive, one-of-a-kind design gently allows the fingers and hand to rest in the correct gripping position.\n\nWith a Pencil Grip that fits over the pencil, the thumb, index, and middle fingers are perfectly positioned. When a child grasps a pencil correctly, they write faster and neater without tiring out their hand muscles.\n\nBecause there are so many different Pencil Grips, it\u2019s critical to understand a child\u2019s specific needs.\n\nFor example, there is a Pencil Grip with built-in guards for students who wrap their thumbs around their index fingers. With this type of Pencil Grip, their fingers may find it easier to maintain proper posture with the protectors on.\n\n2. Slant boards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nWriting on a slanted surface is a common biomechanical strategy occupational therapists employ to promote proper wrist position and improve handwriting.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in Florida, \u201cthe handwriting task is modified by elevating the upper extremity to stabilise the wrist in extension while also allowing the hand and forearm to rest on a supportive surface when using a slant board set at 20 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe slant board aids handwriting by facilitating proper posture and gradually developing proximal stability.\n\nThe concept behind using a slant board to improve pencil grip is based on wrist position.\n\nTo produce legible written work, a student must move their wrist and elbow in a fluid motion. To be effective, the wrist must be extended or up-bent.\n\nSo, the slant board promotes wrist extension when writing by causing the wrist to extend while the fingers flex and naturally fall into a better writing position.\n\n3. Graphic Organisers\n\nPeople with learning disabilities are often visual learners and thinkers, according to the Learning Disabilities Association of America. This means when ideas, words, and concepts are associated with pictures, diagrams, charts, and maps, they understand and remember such information better.\n\nHence, the need to adopt graphic organisers.\n\nGraphic organisers are simple but powerful tools that can help people with dysgraphia, executive functioning issues, or other issues that cause writing difficulties.\n\nGraphic organisers are visual thinking tools that help individuals visualise their ideas. The images show relationships between facts, concepts, or ideas and guide their thinking as they create the map or diagram.\n\nThese graphic organisers range from Venn diagrams, concept maps, mind maps to flowing charts.\n\nVenn diagrams demonstrate how different things or ideas can overlap to show, compare, or contrast relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Data Science Venn Diagram \u2014 Drew Conway\n\nConcept maps help organise information, brainstorm ideas, visualising them, and planning what you want to write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: PM-Training.net\n\nMind maps are graphical representations of hierarchical data that include a central idea surrounded by connected branches of related topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Venngage\n\nThey\u2019re excellent for generating new ideas, solving problems, and illustrating relationships and/or process components. XMind, Mindly and Coggle are examples of mind mapping software.\n\nFlow charts are graphic organisers that show how different steps in a process interact with each other. This makes them valuable tools for communicating how methods work and documenting how a particular job is done.\n\nMapping a process in a flow chart format can help clarify the process and show where the process can be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Hubspot\n\n4. Keyboards and touchscreens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Tech News Inc\n\nHandwriting can be painful and tiring for people with dysgraphia, so typing written work on a computer is essential.\n\nUsing keyboards and touchscreens allows them to enter letters and words by typing or touching the screen. So, a keyboard with alphabetical keys or vowels and consonants in different colours may be the perfect fit for someone with dysgraphia.\n\n5. Dictation\n\nDictation technology, also known as speech-to-text, voice-to-text, voice recognition, or speech recognition technology, assists people who have difficulty writing. It converts spoken words into text.\n\nInstead of writing by hand or with a keyboard, dictation allows people to write words by speaking them aloud. People can use dictation to write, edit, and revise their work.\n\nWhile there are built-in dictation tools in devices such as computers, smartphones, digital tablets, and Chromebooks, there are also web-based, app-based, and software dictation tools.\n\nOther tools that can be used\n\nTools like predictive text, writing guide, raised-line paper, lettering stencils, electronic dictionaries and Thesaurus, and Word Banks are examples of other tools that can help people with dysgraphia.\n\nGrammarly is an app that assists people with spelling and grammar that they might overlook because they focus on content rather than writing.\n\nEvernote is a note-taking app that allows people to photograph worksheets and type answers directly into the blanks. It can also be synchronised across devices, giving users access to notes and other items no matter where they are working.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that a person with a learning disability cannot be cured with AT as there is no known cure for any learning disability.\n\nRegardless, rather than focusing on a person\u2019s disabilities, AT tools allow them to demonstrate and apply their intelligence and knowledge.\n\nConsequently, with occupational therapy and support from parents, teachers, and loved ones, AT tools can help people with dysgraphia to reach their full potential in school and at home.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We can prevent these persons from dying from COVID-19 because it makes primary disease conditions worsen and make the person succumb to death.\n\n\u201cA case to be mentioned is that of a 28-year-old male suffering from kidney disease that died; possibly he would have lived long but for COVID-19, which made him succumb to the challenge that he was facing.\n\n\u201cVaccination is important and necessary. When vaccinated, one will not succumb readily to the primary disease condition, and even if infected, will not readily die from it and if vaccinated and get hospitalized, one will not succumb easily to death.\u201d\n\n...",

The Commission needs a safe and secure environment for efficient and professional deployment of staff and materials\u201d.\n\nOn the issue of security, the chairman said that, the Commission is fully aware of the fluid security situation in Anambra State and different parts of the country and will continue to work with the Inter Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security at the National, State and Local Governments towards securing the electoral environment.\n\n\u201cThe voters must be assured of their security and must feel confident approaching the polling units to exercise their democratic franchise. We must also realize that the responsibility of the Commission is to organize, undertake and supervise elections within the context and ambit of the Constitution. Section 178 of the Constitution has circumscribed the period for the conduct of governorship electons and this period is cast in stone and immovable.\n\n\u201cWe must do all that is constitutionally and legally possible to avoid the constitutional challenge that may likely ensue in the State if the Commission is unable to conduct elections on account of security challenges. On our part, we are determined to conduct a good election in Anambra and in other parts of Nigeria. We shall not compromise on the conduct of a good election in any part of Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nHe also noted that, \u201cWe must realize that young men and women doing their National Youth Service form the bulk of our Presiding Officers must be protected as some of them are the only sons and daughters of their parents. Some of them graduated from school through determined perseverance in the face of hardship. Some of them are the products of community effort while some of them did menial jobs to graduate. We therefore have a responsibility to protect them in the performance of this national assignment. No form of insurance can cover for the loss of one life and the Commission will on no account compromise on the safety and welfare of these individuals and all other staff that will be deployed for the election\u201d.\n\nWhile congratulating the INEC Press Corp for organizing this program, Yakubu stated that the program is timely and germane considering the fact that the Governorship election in Anambra State is a few weeks away. This program and its outcome will no doubt point a clear pathway for the smooth and successful conduct of the said election.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Oyo State Government has asked the Court of Appeal, sitting in Port Harcourt, to be joined in the suit instituted by the Rivers State Government against the Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nThe suit is in respect of the bid by the Rivers government to take over the collection of the Value Added Tax (VAT) from the federal government.\n\nThe joinder request is contained in a statement issued on Tuesday in Ibadan by Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nAccording to the statement, the suit, instituted by the Attorney-General of Oyo State, Oyelowo Oyewo, is seeking an order of the Appellate Court to enable Oyo State to join the suit as an interested party.\n\n\u201cIn the suit, the Government of Oyo State is seeking two orders, viz: an order of the Honourable Court joining the Attorney-General of Oyo State as a respondent on the appeal with suit number FHC/PH/CS/149/2020 and appeal number CA/PH/282/2021 and any other order the Court may deem fit.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Attorney-General of Oyo State, the government of Oyo State was unaware of the suit between the Attorney-General of Rivers State and the Federal Inland Revenue Service at the Federal High Court until the judgment was delivered.\n\n\u201cOther grounds upon which the application was based include that the decision of the appellate court will affect the collection of VAT by the government of Oyo State, being one of the states which the judgment of the lower court recognised as entitled to collect VAT within its territorial jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cOyo State Government also indicates that the applicant, Attorney-General of the State, represents the interest of the Oyo State Government, whose interest in the collection of VAT within Oyo State will be impacted one way or another by any judgment delivered by this Honourable Court in this appeal,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAccording to the statement, the grounds claimed by the Oyo State Government include that: \u201cThe applicant is a necessary party to this suit being a party who will be bound by the judgment of this Honourable Court in this Appeal.\n\n\u201cThe interests of the applicant and that of the respondent in this case are similar being states within the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nOyo will become the second state seeking to join the suit after Lagos filed a joiner application following the decision of the federal government to challenge the ruling of the Rivers State High Court. The court had held that it is unconstitutional for the FIRS to collect VAT and personal income tax in the state.\n\nOn September 10, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu signed the state\u2019s VAT Bill into law, authorising officials to collect the tax in the state. On the same day, the appellate court ordered both the Rivers and Lagos governments to stay action on their bids to start VAT collection.\n\n\u2018Interest of justice\u2019\n\nAccording to the Oyo State Government, it is in the interest of justice that the appellate court grants the application, adding that the joinder will not prejudice the appellants and respondents.\n\nIt further stated that the state, being one of the 36 states of Nigeria, would be affected by the decision of the appellate court.\n\nIt added that joining the state to the suit already instituted by Rivers would help to avoid multiplicity of suits by the states against the Federal Government.\n\nIn a Motion on Notice, also attached to the proceedings already filed before the court, Oyo State said it relied on eight grounds and declared that the state was a necessary party to be joined since it has sufficient interest in the outcome of the appeal.\n\nThe state argued that after going through its processes, the appellate court would find that the application was necessary and that it has sufficient interest in the determination of the appeal as one of the states of the federation.",

A war that earned him a bullet that stayed lodged in his skull ever since. From this experience of violence and death, he went on to become a doctor saving thousands of lives \u2014 a powerful testament to his journey through life.\n\nHe was a loving husband. It is no surprise that, on the day of his untimely death, he was on his way from a memorial lecture in honor of his late wife, who he cherished and honored even in death. At this event and always, he invited everyone to be like his wife Dora.\n\nHe was a father and grandfather. With joy, he would share that he was a grandfather to 9 grandchildren. He welcomed his youngest grandchild just a little over a month ago and had yet to meet her. Ask any of the grandchildren about Grandpa, and they will tell you stories of love and support, be it his long text to his oldest granddaughter at the victory of Kamala Harris inviting her to note the inspiration for herself or speaking to his namesake and grandson Chike, reminding him of his own limitless potential.\n\nHe was an older brother to all his siblings, many of whom call him Daddy in reverence and recognition of his love.\n\nHe was a healer. A passionate surgeon, Dr. Chike was the Medical Director at St. Leo\u2019s Hospital in Enugu. For decades he served countless people, many of whom he cared for and healed at no cost. His one request was always that they paid it forward.\n\nHe started his healing journey in the north where he built and ran a mobile clinic in Jaban Kogo. For many months, he lived and worked among the people, studying and becoming fluent in Hausa to better serve his patients. His commitment to providing healthcare to that community earned him the National Youth Service Merit Award.\n\nHe was a philanthropist. For 45 years he treated priests in Bigard Memorial Seminary and beyond for free, trusting this to be his calling.\n\nHe was a Papal Knight of Saint John, a title bestowed by the Vatican in recognition of his dedication and service to the Church.\n\nHe was a man of the people, loved by many for his wisdom and for his courage to always speak the truth. His counsel was sought far and wide.\n\nHe is remembered for his ability to hold an audience captive with his words and stories. To hear him speak in Igbo was to be blessed by the wisdom of endless proverbs.\n\nHe was an ordinary man who, everyday, showed his extraordinary commitment to his community and his people by his ability to help people in need without question.\n\nIn his final days, his heart was heavy about the state of things in Nigeria. He lamented about the struggles of people unable to pay for treatment anymore and about the unfortunate state of unrest where human life had lost its value.\n\nHis hope echoed that of his beloved wife and our mother, that Nigeria might lean on the forces of unity and shun disunity. That we might do the right thing, trusting that our potential lies in the goodness of the people and the greatness of the nation.\n\nWhat happens if we move closer to these ideals?\n\nHis murder and death leave a gap which sorrow cannot fill.\n\nMay it not be in vain.\n\nSigned,\n\nDr. Ijeoma Akunyili,\n\nDr. Edozie Akunyili,\n\nDr. Somto Akunyili Asuzu,\n\nNjideka Akunyili Crosby,\n\nChidiogo Akunyili-Parr,\n\nObumneme Akunyili,\n\nAnd their families",

          "title": "500 killed in Sokoto within 2 months, 50, 000 flee to Niger Republic as Senate makes crucial demand",
          "text": "The Senate Wednesday told President Muhammadu Buhari to declare bandits as terrorists and wage total war against them.\n\nClassification of bandits as terrorists by the Senate came on the heels of killings being carried out by the criminal elements across the three senatorial zones of Sokoto state.\n\nMassive killings of innocent lives in Sokoto state, totalling about 500 within the last two months, was brought to the attention of the red chamber by Senator Ibrahim Abdullahi Gobir (APC Sokoto East ), through a motion sponsored along with eight other lawmakers.\n\nIn the motion titled: \u201cBanditry in Sokoto State,\u201d Senator Gobir said the eastern senatorial district of the state had now become a safe haven for bandits due to the ongoing crackdown against them in Zamfara state.\n\nHe specifically lamented that on Saturday, 25th September, 2021, Twenty One (21) Security Personnel were killed in Dama and Gangara villages by rampaging bandits, 15 of them soldiers, 3 Mobile Police and 3 members of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps; in addition to yet to be ascertained number of civilians from neighbouring villages.\n\nThis, he explained, had gone to portray the seriousness of the problem which requires concerted and urgent action by the declaration of total war on banditry by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe said losing such number of trained security personnel would further deplete the numerical strength of the nation\u2019s security agencies and jeopardise the security architecture of the country.\n\nGobir said: \u201cNo section of the State within the last two months has not been attacked in one way or the other by the bandits with attendant loss of innocent lives totalling about 500 when figures are put together from one affected community to the other.\n\n\u201cNot less than 50,000 Nigerians have hurriedly relocated to Niger Republic as a result of incessant attacks of armed bandits on their communities.\n\n\u201cWhile the crackdown on the bandits was taking place in Zamfara State, no concrete measures have been taken in Sokoto State leaving it totally exposed to the activities of the bandits which made most of them to relocate to Sabon Birni and Isa Local Governments.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker further lamented that the present military onslaught on the bandits \u201cis not well co-ordinated because it is only being orchestrated in Zamfara State instead of all the frontline States ravaged by banditry, i.e. Sokoto, Katsina, Niger and Kaduna States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operation should be holistic instead of restrictive in order to produce effective and the desired results,\u201d he stressed.\n\nVirtually all the lawmakers who spoke on the matter, including Senators Uche Ekwunife (PDP Anambra Central) and Ali Ndume (APC Borno South), called on government and security agencies to make the war against banditry and insurgency in the country, a well coordinated and potent one.\n\nIn his remarks, Senate President Ahmad Lawan commended the security agencies were doing their best in curtailing crimes and criminalities in the country.\n\nHe, however, called for improved appropriation for the armed forces to meet their needs, even as he said concerned committees should ensure the monies were appropriately used.\n\nHe said: \u201cDistinguished colleagues, I think the issue of insecurity is one issue we will never get tired of debating here, and we must commend our Armed Forces and other Security Agencies.\n\n\u201cThey give their lives in trying to secure this country, and that is the ultimate sacrifice anybody could pay. I believe that they are doing their best, but we also need to do our best as a government by giving them the kind of resources that they need.\n\n\u201cI believe we have done that in the supplementary budget like pointed out, but we also need to improve the annual appropriation for them.\n\n\u201cIf we could pass over N800 billion in the supplementary budget, I don\u2019t see why we cannot improve the resources up to N1 trillion and then hold our security agencies accountable.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that we need to monitor the procurement processes when we give such kind of resources to our Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cThe security related committees, particularly the armed forces related committees \u2013 Defence, Army, Navy and Airforce Committees \u2013 need to work very closely on the procurement processes by these services.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that funds appropriated are not put in the wrong areas, and ensure that this fight is taken to its logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nResolutions\n\nIn its resolutions, the Senate also urged President Buhari to declare all the known leadership of the bandits wanted and track them wherever they are for arrest and prosecution; and as well directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other disaster management outfits, to as a matter of urgency, give all the necessary supports to victims of the menace of banditry in Sokoto and other parts of the country.\n\nKilling of Akunyili, others\n\nIn a related development, gunmen, Tuesday, killed Dr Chike Akunyili, the husband of late Professor Dora Akunyili, former Director General National Agency for Food and Drug and Administration (NAFDAC).\n\nAccording to reports, Akunyili was shot dead by gun-wielding women at Nkpor junction in Idemili North local government area Anambra state while returning from an event where his late wife was honoured by the University of Nigeria Nsukka Alumni Association (UNAA), Onitsha branch.\n\nAlthough the state Police command was yet to confirm the report, a viral video showed the deceased in the pool of his blood.\n\n\u201cGod, please render the devil and his agents powerless and useless. I was with this man yesterday (Tuesday) same yesterday at Sharon Hall, All Saints Cathedral, Onitsha. It was an occasion of University of Nigeria Nsukka Alumni Association (UNAA), Onitsha branch event where they honoured late Dora Akunyili.\n\n\u201cHe spoke glowingly about Dora and made a donation of 500k (N500, 000) to the association.\n\n\u201cHe was there with his son, Obum now working with Anambra state government. We saw them off to the car and it was emotional when Obum hugged him tight as both of them separated to join their respective vehicles. \u201cObum was in a white Hilux while the man was in a big Jeep (I think Prado). God have mercy!\u201da source stated.\n\nOn what could be the deceased\u2019s offence, another source claimed he was not the target but \u201chis sin is that his security wanted to clear the road because of a heavy traffic at Nkpor. Some girls and boy with covered face started shooting at them immediately they saw the security guys clearing the road. He saw what was happening and wanted to move out of his jeep, the girls faced him and fired him.\u201d\n\nOhaneze, CAN call for unity\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) have called for unity among the Igbo nation.\n\nThe two groups which lamented constant killings in Igbo land called for unity among members of the nation.\n\nThey made the call Wednesday during a prayer summit to mark the World Igbo Day at the Christian Ecumenical Centre, Abakaliki.\n\nIt was organised by Ebonyi state branch of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in collaboration with the state government.\n\nRepresenting the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo George Obiozor, Secretary General of the group, Okey Emuche, noted that Igbo land was under siege.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need to take a pulse concerning Igbo nation, we need to seek the face of God, we need to remember our brothers and sisters who have been killed over the years.\n\n\u201cBut more importantly we need to think about today, the Igbo nation is under siege, too many killings. As I sat there waiting for the event to start, a video was sent to me about the latest killing in Anambra state- the husband of late Professor Dora Akunyili was brutally murdered.\n\n\u201cThe killings for the last couple of days in Anambra state calls for introspection, called for a pulse. We are under siege; the southeast states are under siege.\n\nWe plead with the men of God gathered here, the CAN are here, mothers, fathers are here, something urgent needs to be done; this is the message of the PG of Ohanaeze.\n\n\u201cHe has asked IPOB to think and to think deeply because if you kill every person, who will be there?\n\n\u201cWe need to take a pulse as a people and understand what is confronting us. Beyond sit-at-home, these killings that have started went round from one state to the other maiming lives for the Igbo people.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chairman Southeast CAN Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali expressed the need for Igbo people to be united.\n\n\u201cIgbo people should unite. Ohaneze Ndigbo General and Ohanaeze youth should unite. If the church is not united, the Igbo nation will be in difficulty. Igbo leaders, traditional rulers and chiefs should come together and seek for unity of Igbo people.\n\n\u201cEnugu, Ebonyi, Igbo nation should come up with an enterprise that will boost its resources that they can stand on their own,\u201d the cleric said.\n\nReprisal in Plateau\n\nIn a related development, four persons were reportedly ambushed and killed in what seems a reprisal in the crises-prone areas of Bassa local government area of Plateau State.\n\nSpokesman of Irigwe Development Association (IDA) Malison Davidson said two of the deceased persons were killed while moving on their motorcycle around Twin Hill Road, Jebbu Miango, Miango District of Rigwe Chiefdom in the local government area, while two others were later found dead in the farm.\n\nHowever, spokesman of the state Police command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, confirmed that only two persons were killed.\n\nBlueprint reports that last week, at least three herders were killed and more than a dozen of their cows rustled at Tashan Maude village near a poultry beside Rafin Bauna in Irigwe chiefdom, while three herders were separately attacked and killed as well.\n\nKaduna shuts down telecoms\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna state government Wednesday directed the shutdown of telecommunications services in the state.\n\nThis, the government said, was to check influx of bandits from Zamfara and Katsina states.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan disclosed this at a press conference in Kaduna.\n\nHe also announced the ban on all motorcycles across the state for three months.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai had in a chat with local broadcast media Tuesday evening said bandits were now coming into the state from Katsina and Zamfara states to make calls and demand ransom.\n\nAccording to Aruwan, relevant federal agencies had already informed the state government that the processes for telecoms shutdown in parts of the state had commenced.\n\n\u201cI am here to announce the implementation of certain measures to assist the security agencies in parts of the state. Governor Nasir el-Rufai announced in a media chat yesterday (Tuesday) that the state government has formally requested the Federal Government to enforce the shutdown of telecom services in parts of the state identified by security agencies as requiring such measures.\n\n\u201cThe relevant federal agencies have today informed the Kaduna state government that the processes for telecoms shutdown in parts of the state have commenced. As part of the steps to address the current security situation in Kaduna state and neighbouring states in the North-West and North-Central regions, KDSG has held several meetings with security agencies to adopt critical measures towards crushing bandits in their identified hideouts.\n\n\u201cThe military and other security forces have been carrying out assaults on the identified locations. The state government is advised that certain measures are now necessary to assist the spirited efforts of these security agencies. The following measures become effective from Thursday, 30 September 2021:\n\n\u201cThe complete ban on the use of motorcycles (Okada) for commercial or personal purposes for three months in the first instance. Ban on possession of or wielding of dangerous weapons. Tricycles are allowed to operate only from 6am to 7pm. All tricycles must remove all curtains. Movement of all tricycles is restricted from dusk till dawn (7pm to 6am).\n\n\u201cAll vehicles used for commercial transport must be painted in yellow and black within 30 days. Vehicles that are part of ride hailing services are to carry yellow and black stripes. Ban on the sale of petrol in jerry cans or other containers in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi, Kachia, Kagarko and Kajuru LGAs persists.\n\n\u201cOther containment measures previously communicated by the Kaduna state government remain in place. These include: ban on felling of trees and forestry activities in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Chikun, Kachia, Kagarko and Kajuru LGAs, ban on firewood and charcoal transportation and ban on the transportation of livestock into and out of the state.\n\n\u201cOthers include cessation of weekly markets in the front line local government areas of Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi, Kajuru and Kawo weekly market of Kaduna North local government. The Kaduna state government regrets the severe strain and inconvenience these measures will place on peaceful and law abiding citizens.\n\n\u201cThe government therefore appeals for the understanding and cooperation of all residents of the affected areas, and indeed across the State. These difficult times have demand that difficult decisions be made. The measures have been adopted purely in the interest of our collective safety and security, and to aid our brave forces in their fight against these mindless criminals.\n\n\u201cToo many lives have been lost, and too many families have been shattered. Small groups of wicked persons cannot continue to hold us to ransom, and force us to live in perpetual fear. Once again, the government craves the understanding of all citizens. The hardship we face will be temporary, and we are confident that in the end, it will pay off. Good will prevail over evil,\u201d Aruwan said.",

          "text": "To adequately police and protect a nation\u2019s territorial integrity through the land, air, and sea, efforts must be geared towards procurement of sophisticated armaments for the Armed Forces, as well as invest inadequate training of personnel on new trends in strategy, tact, leadership, fighting skills, and weapon handling. This in addition to building capability in local manufacturing of the needed military hardware and logistics equipment, writes our Defence correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nThough no nation is an island onto itself when it comes to manufacturing of light and lethal military armaments and logistics equipment, but some are more equal than others.\n\nWhile, the United States, Russian China, UK, Israel, France, Iran, North Korea, Japan, India, Brazil, and Pakistan, may be self sufficient in the area of manufacturing of these armaments and logistics equipment, they still depend on each other for certain hardware so as to maintain balance of force.\n\nRegrettably, most nations in Africa have not build the technical capability of becoming self sufficient in weapon manufacturing, and hence depend on other advanced nations for their supplies, even when its territories are battle field for terrorism, insurgency, sea piracy human trafficking amongst several other ills that depend on light and lethal weapons to execute their nefarious mandate.\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces is not insulated from this abnormality in the continent. However, the Armed Forces of Nigeria, especially the Nigerian Navy is making effort to bridge this identified gap.\n\nBut before presenting the graphic details of what the service had done thus far in this regard, it is imperative to also highlight the effort of Federal Government in the area of fleet renewal for the service.\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral AZ Gambo posited that the NN\u2019s ability to effectively deliver improved maritime security for the nation would be greatly enhanced if critical equipment shortfall in the areas of operating platforms and key infrastructure are addressed.\n\nThe CNS who said this while delivering a paper at Bayero University Kano, during the recently concluded Chief of the Naval Staff Annual Conference 2021further averred that the critical platforms including ships and aircraft are crucial for maritime operations.\n\n\u201cNotably, Mr President Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Federal Republic of Nigeria recently granted approval for the NN to acquire 2 x Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs). Furthermore, the NN seeks to strengthen ongoing discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturers to commence local manufacturing/fabrication of spares as a sustainable means of guaranteeing fleet availability and readiness,\u201d Vice Admiral Gambo said.\n\nEnumerating the indigenous ship building effort of the Nigerian Navy, the CNS said: \u201cThe NN Research and Developmental efforts gained traction with local construction and production of equipment that erstwhile are usually vendor-driven and are sourced from manufacturers outside the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with this, the NN initiated an indigenous ship design/building with the construction of Tugboat COMMANDER UGWU and Seaward Defence Boats namely; 31.3m NNS ANDONI and 38m NNS KARADUWA while a third 43m SDB is currently under construction at the Naval Dockyard Limited (NDL).\n\n\u201cThe vessel is programmed to join the Service by the Fourth quarter of this year\u201d.\n\nThe CNS also disclosed that about 170 riverine patrol boats were also built in-country, thus complementing indigenous shipbuilding capacity, employment generation and skills acquisition.\n\nHe noted that these efforts have made the desired positive impacts on the nation\u2019s socio economic development.\n\nThe number one Naval officer said that, \u201crequisite hydrographic capability is one of the key enablers in the attainment of a sustainable blue economy for the nation. The NN intends to develop hydrographic capacity beyond mere surveys to the production of relevant charts to incorporating data relevant to the blue economy and national security. Recently, the NN has upgraded its Hydrography Department to produce navigational and bathymetric charts. This has caused reduction in foreign exchange losses previously deployed to procure these charts.\n\n\u201cProspective hydrographic surveys would be governed by the principle of \u2018one data collection, multiple usage\u2019 to facilitate its use in support of hydro-seismic data, safety of navigation and military applications. Thus, to bolster its hydrographic survey capability, the NN recently acquired a Hydrographic Survey Vessel NNS LANA. Also, arising from the extant Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NN and Nigerian Export and Import Bank, the NN recently took delivery of some hydrographic survey equipment procured by the Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, efforts are ongoing to upgrade the NN Hydrographic Department to a National Hydrographic Agency (NHA) by 2025 to attract independent funding to drive attainment of its future objectives in line with best practices. This development would further boost the maritime trade and shipping activities along the nation\u2019s maritime domain for enhanced national development\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on some of the measures the service put in place to guarantee safe maritime environment, the CNS said: \u201cA commendable stride has also been made by the NN in the enhancement of its surveillance capabilities through a Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) project to enhance our maritime security architecture. The twin but complementary systems of the Regional Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) facility and the FALCON EYE system leverage modern technology to enhance the safeguard of immense hydrocarbon and other mineral resources in the nation\u2019s maritime domain with highly encouraging outputs. The FALCON EYE System incorporates surveillance and intelligence capabilities which allows for real time monitoring of activities in the nation\u2019s maritime environment. This facilitates decision making on shipping activities, maritime safety and violation of maritime laws.\n\n\u201cThe FALCON EYE system played a key role in the rescue of the crew of Chinese FV HAILUFENG II by NN in 2020. In addition, the intelligence generated from the 2 systems led to the arrest of over 30 vessels engaged in IUUF as well as the arrest of over 50 pirates. With these assets, the NN is better positioned to guarantee maritime security which in turn will boost Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas production and other maritime activities that are essential for the sustenance of the nation\u2019s economy\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff nonetheless said that in spite of improved FGN intervention in support of various NN engagements, the current level of statutory funding for the NN is still far below the requirement to sustain a force capable of discharging its roles effectively.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it requires about 800,000 litres of AGO to sail NNS THUNDER for 14-21 days continuous sea patrol. This is without adding costs for other essentials such as water, rations, operational allowances, personal protection equipment, arms and ammunition. The cost of sustaining a ship such as NNS THUNDER and the entire NN Fleet can thus be better imagined. Inadequacy of funds affects ship availability and sustainability for effective maritime response. It is only rational therefore, that the NN considers the option of stakeholder contributions to the logistics cost of sustaining the NN fleet in furtherance of maritime security. Accordingly, NN recently made a presentation at the National Assembly on a bill for an act to establish the Nigerian Maritime Trust Fund for the purpose of training, provision of security equipment and related facilities to enhance the skills of personnel of the NN,\u201d he proposed.\n\nHe further theorized that in the foreseeable future, the maritime domain would continue to provide the mainstay of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cTo enhance NN\u2019s ability to effectively address emerging challenges for improved operational efficiency, the Service is articulating new perspectives taking into cognizance its past experiences, current operational realities and the contemporary strategic security environment,\u201d he conclueded.",

          "title": "Insecurity will persist unless Nigerians are meaningfully engaged \u2013 APC chieftain -NigPilot",
          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has said that the country will continue to be confronted with the security challenges it is currently facing as long as a majority of Nigerians were not properly and meaningfully engaged.\n\nLukman, who noted that security agencies in the country were already overstretched stressed that governments at various levels must find a way of making positive use of the abundant human resources because the over-reliance on oil revenue will not solve the problems.\n\nThe PGF DG said contrary to insinuations that the spate of insecurity appears to have worsened since the APC administration came to power in 2015, the insurgency was not the only problem troubling the country pre-2015, stressing that there were cases of cattle rustling in the entire North as far back as 2013 as well as kidnapping in the Southern parts of the country.\n\nLukman also took time to explain some of the measures he thinks should be implemented to make the APC to function more effectively as a real progressive political party.\n\n\u201cI believe as a party, immediately after the Convention, the first thing the new leadership should do is to have a membership data that is computerized. We can\u2019t continue to have a situation where our membership data is not electronically preserved. We must ensure that our membership data is updated electronically without the tedious process of handling it in an analog way.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we must have a national secretariat because membership is everything to a political party, a situation where the administrative framework of the national secretariat is so weak and loosed that it links to what is obtainable at the local government and state levels and creates its own complications. So the first thing the new leadership must do is to reorganize the national secretariat in such a way it has that organic relation between it and all the structures of the party so that at the ward level, even if somebody leaves the party, it will be immediately known by the national leadership, and if somebody joins the party, he should be quietly be registered at the ward without the noise in the media, it should be seamless.\u201d\n\nThe DG of the PGF also spoke on the internal crisis that has rocked the party insisting that it is not a problem experienced only by the APC, adding that as a convergence of people from diverse backgrounds and interests, there are bound to be minor disagreements which do not necessarily mean that the party will implode.\n\nHe noted that even before and even immediately after the meager that brought about the APC, many analysts had thought that the party was going to disintegrate, assuring that whatever seems to be the situation today will still be handled by the party.\n\n\u201cIt is important to return to the basic framework that every party is an organization that has various interests. It is difficult to have a political party where people do not have diverse interests. But the most important is to have and build a party where the aggregation of the various interests will be able to win the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe major issue is that even before the merger, there is the notion that parties do not have the power to win the confidence of the people as it were. I also do not think that while negotiating for the merger, nobody believed it was going to be a party that can appeal to everybody. Even some people in the merger had sympathy for the PDP then.\n\n\u201cOne basic issue is the need to have strong point about the need to institute reconciliation within the party. The major issue we have insisted is that you can\u2019t have a political party without a credible membership register. Good enough the Caretaker Committee bought that idea and we have done it and that is the basic of the new book I have written. It is a contribution to help in an advisory capacity to support the leadership to know what needs to be done to make the party appeal to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lukman, the party must be run democratically where all the organs have the opportunity to discharge their functions unlike what obtained in the last National Working Committee (NWC) that did not function in tandem with the books of the party.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for the party to be democratic which means that organs of the party should be meeting regularly to be taking decisions; when we talk about party supremacy, it is not the position of an individual leader that should serve as supremacy of the party when the organs are not meeting which is the major issue with the last NWC, the National executive Committee (NEC) wasn\u2019t meeting, the only organ that was meeting was the administrative organ and it was difficult at that time to now say that the Constitution of the party was being respected.\n\n\u201cThe second issue is what we can call the ideological thrust of the party. This is the party that was envisioned to be progressive, what it means to be progressive has to do with the capacity to issue related to governance and politics and decisions in terms of what is in the best interest of the people. This is a very hard decision, they may not be attractive but generally, being progressive is about taking popular decisions, it is not about those cheap decisions that people take and which is why my basic position is that these are not issues that can be sorted out if you don\u2019t go back to lay solid foundation in terms of how the party recruits members, for instance, and this is not just with the APC, it is basically the same for every political party.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the political parties and Nigerians is so weak and that is the argument I am canvassing in that book, it dwells on the type of relationship the party should have with interest groups, non government actors, youth organizations, women organizations, persons living with disabilities.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Federal Government has approved a 14-day paternity leave for fathers with newborn babies in the country.\n\nHead of Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs Folasade Yemi-Esan, announced this on Wednesday at the end of the Federal Executive Council meeting held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\n\u201cPaternity leave is the leave that is approved for men when their spouses or wives have given birth to a newborn baby,\u201d she told State House correspondents in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cOr if the husband and wife have just adopted a baby of less than four months, then the man is entitled to paternity leave of about 14 days.\n\n\u201cThat is what has been approved for men so that the men and their babies also can bond well together. It\u2019s important because we want the young children and the youth to really bond properly with their fathers, just as they bond well with their mothers.\u201d\n\nYemi-Esan explained that the approval of the new duration of paternity leave was one of the major reforms introduced into the nation\u2019s civil service.\n\nShe stated that the last time the Federal Government reviewed its Public Service Rules (PSR) was in 2008, thus the need for the latest review.\n\nAccording to the head of civil service, workers\u2019 leave will now be calculated based on working days rather than the initial calendar days.\n\n\u201cSo, this (14 days) is the time that has been approved now for men to bond at the early stages.\n\n\u201cEspecially at the early stages of a child\u2019s life, that is when it\u2019s very important for this bonding to take place,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also briefed reporters on the efforts taken by the government to tackle the issue of discrepancies between the degree and the Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates in the government workforce.\n\nYemi-Esan stated that while the government had already taken steps in that regard, it would not reflect in the public service rules.\n\n\u201cOn the discrepancies between HND and degree programme, it is in the scheme of service that this will be reflected, not in the PSR \u2026 and currently, we are reviewing the scheme of service,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari will on Thursday, September 30, 2021, unveil \u2018\u2018Discover Nigeria\u2019\u2019, a pictorial book on Nigeria\u2019s history, covering the period from Independence in 1960 to the present.\n\nThe 392-page book, authored by Bayo Omoboriowo, the President\u2019s official photographer, showcases the country\u2019s rich traditional institutions, ingenuity of its people, the beauty of its landscape, the richness of its farmlands, stunning waterfalls and seas, among others.\n\nOn the eve of the presentation, which coincides with Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary celebration, Omoboriowo hinted that the book has been enlisted as a contender for the Guinness World Records largest photobook.\n\n\u2018\u2018The previous record for the largest photobook is 45sqm. The \u2018\u2018Discover Nigeria\u2019\u2019 book has been printed and mounted as a 60sqm giant frame book-60 images, 60 pages, 60 square meters, celebrating Nigeria at 60 (60:60:60:60),\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOmoboriowo explained that the book presentation was conceived as part of Nigeria\u2019s diamond celebration.\n\nOver 60 young Nigerians took part in the construction of the giant frame book mounted at the State House Conference Centre (formerly Banquet Hall), venue of the event, which will be attended by governors, traditional rulers, members of the diplomatic corps, the business community and stakeholders in the creative industry.\n\nThe event will also feature an exhibition of Nigeria\u2019s Art, craft and cultures, across the six geo-political zones \u2013 curated by the National Council of Arts and Culture (NCAC).\n\nThe exhibition entails a detailed display of various artworks, artefacts and cultural symbols from various states and ethnic groups in the country.\n\nNigeria\u2019s cuisine & delicacies will also be on display.\n\n\u2018\u2018The overall goal of this event is to remind all and sundry, the beauty that our diversity brings, and the strength that our unity affords us as a country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We believe that an after-effect from the event will be the changing narratives about the important role everyone plays in the Nigeria project,\u2019\u2019 Omoboriowo said.\n\nThe foreword of the book is written by former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, and an introduction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who acknowledged the contribution of the Special Assistant to the President, Tunde Sabi\u2019u Yusuf, to the publication.\n\nThere are also reviews from General Ibrahim Babangida, a former Head of State, Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote and the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader and former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nIn his foreword, General Abubakar says \u2018\u2018\u2026 This book, \u2018Discover Nigeria\u2019 brings a smile to my face. Chronicling our people, places, progress and more, it is an invitation to all to discover- and rediscover-Nigeria. This book is more than beautiful images. It reflects the heart and soul of Nigeria through images that tell stories and texts that share insights in Nigeria\u2019s history, the present day and the future.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his review, General Babangida lauds the youthful dominance in Nigeria\u2019s creative industry and their penchant to demand a better Nigeria from the government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I draw a lot of inspiration from the works of the younger generation in the creative industry, from their pursuit of knowledge and most importantly, their desire to hold the Government accountable in helping to achieve a better and more prosperous Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 Babangida says.",

          "text": "China Evergrande Group missed paying bond interest due on Wednesday, two bondholders said, its second unpaid offshore debt payment in a week, although the cash-strapped company is scrambling to meet its obligations in its home market.\n\nThe company, reeling under a debt pile of $305 billion, was due on Wednesday to make a $47.5 million bond interest payment on its 9.5% March 2024 dollar bond, after having missed $83.5 million in coupon payments last Thursday.\n\nWith liabilities equal to 2% of China\u2019s GDP, Evergrande has sparked concerns its woes could spread through the financial system and reverberate around the world, though worries have eased somewhat after the central bank vowed to protect homebuyers\u2019 interests.\n\nThe developer\u2019s silence on its offshore payment obligations has, however, left global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when 30-day grace periods end for coupons that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.\n\nSome offshore Evergrande bondholders had neither received interest payments nor any communication by the end of Wednesday New York time, said the people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the issue.\n\nA spokesperson for Evergrande did not have any immediate comment. Reuters was unable to determine whether Evergrande has told bondholders what it plans to do regarding the coupon payment due on Wednesday.\n\nThe two missed offshore payments come as the company, which has nearly $20 billion in offshore debt, faces deadlines on dollar bond coupon payments totalling $162.38 million in the next month.\n\nOnce China\u2019s top-selling developer, Evergrande is now expected to be one of the largest-ever restructurings in the country. It has been prioritising its onshore liabilities amid concerns about its troubles triggering social unrest.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see there being much willingness to give a fairer outcome to offshore bondholders rather than onshore banks, let alone house buyers and people who have lent onshore through the personal loan structures,\u201d said Alexander Aitken, a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cOf course legally there is also structural subordination from being offshore, which means lenders to Evergrande\u2019s onshore subsidiaries get paid before lenders to the parent company or any offshore debt issuer.\u201d\n\nCONSTRUCTION RESUMPTION\n\nBeijing is unlikely to intervene directly to resolve Evergrande\u2019s crisis in the form of a bailout, but analysts say it is wary of a messy collapse that could fuel unrest by local investors, suppliers and homebuyers.\n\nAuthorities have in recent days prodded government-owned firms and state-backed property developers to purchase some Evergrande assets to reduce such risks.\n\nSome instant messaging groups used by people owed money by Evergrande to organize protests and discuss claims have been blocked on Tencent Holdings\u2019 WeChat platform, group members said on Wednesday.\n\nEvergrande said on Wednesday that it would sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd (2066.HK) to a state-owned asset management company.\n\nThe bank, one of Evergrande\u2019s main lenders, demanded all net proceeds from the sale go towards settling the developer\u2019s debts with Shengjing, which had 7 billion yuan in loans to Evergrande as of the first half last year. read more\n\nSeparately, Evergrande\u2019s Pearl River Delta business said in a WeChat post on Tuesday that nearly 20 developments in the area have resumed construction. The post showed construction photos of various sites, and said that work resumption had accelerated since Evergrande vowed at the beginning of the month to deliver homes to buyers.\n\nIts main onshore unit Hengda Real Estate Group announced a resolution of an onshore bond coupon payment on Sept. 23 through \u201cprivate negotiations\u201d.\n\nEvergrande\u2019s shares opened sharply higher on Thursday, rising as much as 5.21% before reversing course to slump as much as 7.17%. The stock was down 5% in afternoon trade.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how the debt is restructured, Evergrande shareholders and investors in offshore, USD-denominated corporate bonds will suffer large losses,\u201d said Jing Sima, chief China strategist at BCA Research in a note.",

          "text": "Britney Spears has been freed from her father. And she could be freed entirely from court control within weeks.\n\nIn a major victory for the pop star, a judge on Wednesday suspended the singer\u2019s father from the conservatorship that has controlled her life and money for 13 years, saying the arrangement \u201creflects a toxic environment.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny agreed with a petition from Spears and her attorney that James Spears needs to give up his role as conservator. The decision comes months after the Britney Spears pleaded for her father\u2019s removal in dramatic court hearings, saying, \u201cI want my life back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current situation is untenable,\u201d the judge said after hearing arguments from both sides. \u201cIt reflects a toxic environment which requires the suspension of James Spears.\u201d\n\nAnd with no objections to ending the conservatorship, Penny is likely to terminate it at a Nov. 12 hearing, restoring the singer\u2019s life and money choices to her after years of increasingly vocal calls to #FreeBritney that she eventually joined.\n\nJames Spears sought the conservatorship in 2008 and had been its primary controller and biggest champion. He reversed course in recent weeks, asking the judge to end the conservatorship immediately, arguing that would render his removal pointless.\n\nThe singer and her attorney agreed that the conservatorship should end, but argued that James Spears\u2019 removal was an essential first step.\n\nBritney Spears was not present at the hearing and did not participate in any way. Her father connected remotely but did not speak during the proceedings. His attorney argued that there was no justification for his removal.\n\n\u201cThere is not a shred of evidence to support suspension,\u201d lawyer Vivian Thoreen told the judge. \u201cHis record is impeccable.\u201d\n\nPenny said her decision was \u201cunappealable,\u201d but Thoreen said she would explore options for appeal regardless.\n\nThe singer\u2019s attorney, Mathew Rosengart, said after the hearing that Britney Spears \u201chas been faced with a decadelong nightmare, Kafkaesque nightmare orchestrated by her father and others.\u201d Rosengart pledged to pursue \u201ceven more serious ramifications for his misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe attorney said he planned to take a \u201ctop-to-bottom look\u201d at the actions of James Spears and his representatives and suggested that law enforcement should investigate revelations in The New York Times about a listening device placed in his daughter\u2019s bedroom.\n\nFans were elated by the ruling.\n\n\u201cMy heart\u2019s racing out of my chest,\u201d said Lorin Sisco of Hawaii, who flew to Los Angeles for the hearing and said she\u2019s been at the courthouse for every proceeding for the past year. \u201cI am so excited for what she has to do with the rest of her life.\u201d\n\nHours before the hearing, a major street outside the courthouse was closed to vehicles, allowing about 100 Spears supporters to march and host a rally where they shouted \u201cHey, hey, ho, ho, the conservatorship has got to go!\u201d and other pro-Britney chants. As the crowd grew, fans sang Spears hits \u201cToxic\u201d and \u201cBaby One More Time,\u201d and speakers described abusive conservatorships that had affected their families.\n\nRosengart, a former federal prosecutor whom Britney Spears was allowed to hire in July, was one of the few lawyers present in the courtroom and delivered a long, dramatic broadside against James Spears that resembled a closing argument in a criminal case.\n\nHe repeatedly used the word \u201ctoxic,\u201d alluding to Spears\u2019 2003 hit, before the judge echoed it in her ruling.\n\n\u201cHe has been abusive, he has been cruel, he has been toxic,\u201d Rosengart said.\n\nThe lawyer said Britney Spears sent him to court with instructions that he do all he could to have her father out, saying she would be \u201cextraordinarily distraught\u201d if he remained.\n\nHe said terminating the conservatorship and entering into settlement talks as James Spears\u2019 attorneys proposed would mean her father would still be in power as it was drawn down.\n\n\u201cBritney Spears deserves to wake up tomorrow without her father as her conservator,\u201d Rosengart said. \u201cCan anybody really dispute that?\u201d\n\nRosengart argued that James Spears wanted to terminate the conservatorship because he did not want the records of his dealings turned over to a successor who could examine his \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nThoreen responded that James Spears had been subjected to required court investigations for years and his removal has never been called for.\n\n\u201cEverything Mr. Spears has done for Miss Spears has been in her best interest,\u201d Thoreen said. \u201cHer best interests would be waking up tomorrow and not being in a conservatorship.\u201d\n\nRosengart argued that James Spears had crossed \u201cunfathomable lines\u201d by engaging in illegal surveillance of her, including communications with her children, her boyfriend and her lawyer, as reported in \u201cControlling Britney Spears,\u201d a documentary from the Times and the FX network, one of two dueling documentaries released on the eve of the hearing.\n\n\u201cThey eavesdropped on some of the most intimate communications of my client,\u201d Rosengart said.\n\nThoreen dismissed those allegations as \u201crhetoric from a TV show\u201d that \u201care not evidence.\u201d\n\nJames Spears stepped aside in 2019 as the so-called conservator of his daughter\u2019s person, with control over her life decisions, maintaining only his role as conservator of her estate, with control over her finances.\n\nPenny appointed John Zabel, an accountant chosen by Rosengart and Britney Spears, to serve as conservator of her finances through the end of the year, but agreed that the conservatorship may be terminated well before that.\n\nJodi Montgomery, a court-appointed professional, now acts as conservator of Britney Spears\u2019 person, and has agreed the conservatorship can and should end.\n\nThe conservatorship was established in 2008 when Britney Spears began to have public mental struggles as hordes of paparazzi aggressively followed her everywhere and she lost custody of her children.",

          "text": "Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Wednesday, presented a budget in the sum of N294.5 billion to the State House of Assembly for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThe governor, who christened the document, \u2018Budget of growth and opportunities,\u2019 said that his administration was determined to move the state from poverty to prosperity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLast year, we presented to you our budget on Continued Consolidation. I had a chance to present to you a report of our accomplishments over the previous budgetary cycle and our plans for 2021.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker Sir, Honourable Members of the House, this year, it gives me great pleasure to be with you again for the presentation of the 2022 Fiscal Budget which we have tagged a Budget of Growth and Opportunities.\u201d\n\nWhile giving a breakdown of the N294.5 billion budget, the governor said capital expenditure stands at the sum of N156 billion, representing 52.97 per cent, while recurrent expenditure will stand at N138.5 billion, amounting to 47.03 per cent.\n\nHe said the N294.5 billion budget represents an 18.3 per cent reduction over the amended 2021 budget, stating that funds for the 2022 budget shall be sourced from internally generated revenue, statutory allocations, and capital receipts.\n\nA further breakdown of the budget indicates that infrastructure is to gulp the sum of N96.6 billion, amounting to 32.83 percent, Education sector is allocated the sum of N54.1b, amounting to 18.37 per cent; the health sector is to get the sum of N17.4b amounting to 5.9 per cent, while Agric will get N11.3b amounting to 3.84 per cent.\n\nMakinde told the lawmakers that his administration last year promised to continue to invest in infrastructure, adding that such investments were not only evenly distributed, they also cut across the thematic aspects of his administration spanning the four-point service agenda.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have worked hard to ensure that infrastructural development is not restricted to just one zone of the state. In education, we have continued to make investments at all levels. At the primary level, we completed 26 model schools across all zones in Oyo State, built 57 classrooms, installed boreholes, and improved the sanitary condition of existing schools through the construction of toilets.\n\n\u201cWe have also continued to improve the quality of education in Oyo State. We not only recruited teachers as reported, but we have also trained them on best practices. More recently we completed the recruitment of 692 education officers in the state.\u201d\n\nHe added that his administration also ensured that the health sector performs creditably in the 2021 fiscal year, adding that the government has continued to keep the promise of reconstructing one Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in each of the 351 electoral Wards of the State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the past year, we completed the renovation, upgrade, and equipping of 40 PHCs. Secondary healthcare facilities have not been left out as we continued to upgrade and rehabilitate existing facilities to serve the good people of Oyo State.\n\n\u201cOn Security, we have made provision to recruit more Amotekun Corps members and we will continue to make investment in technology that supports our security architecture in Oyo State.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the state has always prioritised infrastructural development, adding that in the last year, his administration intensified efforts on building projects that can generate more income for the state.\n\nThe governor further disclosed that the Challenge Bus Terminal in Ibadan was 70 per cent complete, while the other three terminals at Iwo Road, New Ife Road, and Ojoo areas of Ibadan,cwere also ongoing.\n\nHe stated that the Fasola Agribusiness Industrial Hub under construction is at about 40 per cent completion, while the state has recorded significant progress in reconstructing the 21km Airport- Ajia-New Ife Express Road with a spur to Amuloko; 12km Apete-Awotan-Akufo Road and the 44.7km Saki-Ogbooro-Igboho Road.\n\nMakinde stated that the Idi Ape-Basorun-Akobo- Odogbo Barracks Road and the 5.2km Gedu-Oroki-Sabo-Asipa Road, are also nearing completion.\n\n\u201cThere is still so much more that needs to be done. We are aware of the complaints of our people regarding roads in Oyo State. We are determined to meet their yearnings for high-quality infrastructure in the state and that is why we continually embark on road rehabilitation and reconstruction. In the immediate, we are carrying out palliative works on these roads\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe governor listed other road projects that will get direct focus in the 2020 budget as including the Iseyin-Oyo road, the Iseyin-Ogbomoso road, and the 110 km Ibadan Circular Road.\n\nHe said the 2022 budget was put together using the inclusive budgeting model already adopted by his administration, whereby Town Hall meetings were held with indigenes and residents at different locations across the geopolitical zones of the state.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, Honorable Members of the House, in keeping with our tradition in the last two years, we again embarked on Townhall Meetings on the 2022 budget and gave stakeholders the opportunity to contribute towards the direction of this budget.\n\n\u201cThe people have again spoken and based on their feedback; we have prepared our budget for the 2022 Fiscal Year.\u201d\n\nHe said the state intends to inject the sum of N156 billion into the economy through investments in infrastructure and by ensuring that \u201cour people have higher purchasing power.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time, our proposed capital expenditure at 52.97% is more than our recurrent expenditure. A major project we will be carrying out in 2022 is 110km Ibadan Circular Road. This tolled road will be a major economic boost as it will create an alternate entry and exit point out of Ibadan and connect the new economic corridor and business district, we are building at Moniya.\n\n\u201cAlso, we will commence the reconstruction of the Iseyin-Ogbomoso Road to further boost economic activities in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stated that his administration will continue to create an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive while opening doors to both local and foreign investors in agribusiness, tourism, and other sectors.\n\nHe used the opportunity to announce the Oyo Agribusiness Summit 2021, which he said would hold in Ibadan in the next few weeks.\n\nWhile giving details of the performance of the 2021 budget, Makinde said budget performance had reached 60 per cent despite the fact that there are three more months to the end of the fiscal year, stating that the state was hopeful of raising the performance to 75 per cent.\n\nHe said for the 2022 fiscal year, the state is projecting an Internally Generated Revenue of N79,796,513,040.00, adding that though the projection was a tall order, his administration plans to achieve it without increasing tax.\n\n\u201cWe already see this working to our advantage as the recently released figures show that our contributions to Nigeria\u2019s Value Added Tax shot up to over N64 Billion.\n\n\u201cWe have continued to follow the Roadmap to Accelerated Development in Oyo State 2019-2023, which highlights the four sectors that our administration has prioritised in engineering a prosperous Oyo State\u201d, he said.\n\nHe noted that the state has continued to exceed UNESCO standards in allocating resources to education\n\nThe Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Hon Adebo Ogundoyin, in his remarks, said the presentation of the 2022 budget will spur lawmakers to redouble their efforts in terms of oversight functions and project monitoring.\n\nAccording to him, the timely presentation of the 2022 budget will also ensure that the legislature completes work on it well before the end of the 2021 fiscal year. He added that the development would help the state keep to the January to December Budget circle.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me state categorically that the budget proposal is not new to us because we have been part of the process at all levels. We are equally convinced that the governor has articulated all the requests and demands of our people based on the outcome of the stakeholders\u2019 consultative meetings on the 2022 budget, held across the State.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, the four cardinal pillars upon which this administration places its development agenda, viz: Education, Health, Economy (driven by Agribusiness), and Security are steadily being pursued and realised.\u201d\n\nHe lauded Governor Makinde for working to grow the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state, adding that the assembly would do everything possible to ensure the checks and balances crucial for achieving a transparent, accountable, and prudent government.\n\nHe also requested that the governor assents to the Legislative Fund Management Law which has been passed by the assembly, adding that states that have assented to the law include Adamawa, Sokoto, Zamfara, Plateau, Delta, Ekiti, and Ondo.\n\n\u201dOnce it is assented to by you, we will be able to implement Consolidated Legislative Salary Structure (CONLESS) which is a uniform salary structure for all the State Houses of Assembly, the Speaker said, adding that some states of the federation are already implementing the consolidated legislative salary structure.\n\n\u201cStates like Rivers, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Plateau, Sokoto, Bayelsa, Delta, Adamawa, and Lagos are already paying their Legislative staff using CONLESS salary structure. In Oyo State, the Judiciary workers have also been enjoying their Consolidated Judiciary Salary Structure (CONJUSS). His Excellency, we do not want to be an exception\u201d, Ogundoyin stated.\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan",
