Hauwa means unique, wonderful, and awesome. Zuzu means beauty and confidence, all these attributes are merged to describe the perfect aesthetic Hauwa de Zuzu (HDZ) woman.\n\n\u201cThe brand is also a movement that has not only brought about positive and social influence to society but to the lives of individuals in a civilised era where social status is being measured. The collection shades light on the juxtaposition between royalty and leadership bringing hope to the minds of the indigenous community for a beautiful future.\n\n\u201cThe collection is lavished with the intricate details of a couture DNA and captivating patterns of African-inspired fabrics from Adire to Aso Oke to the sensual alluring taste of silk, lace, and organdi embedded with astonishing handcrafted details appraising the femininity of a woman\u2019s silhouette.\u201d",

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has blamed members of the deep state and foreign mercenaries for executing the vicious attacks on the Abia State cattle market.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, the attack was carried out to instigate the killings of ndigbo living in the far north and to spread civil conflicts between Igbos and their northern brethren.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Governors of the South East of Nigeria and the Igbo World\u2019s congress to jointly hire forensic and security experts and investigators from any part of the world to uncover the exact identities of the so-called unknown gunmen,\u201d HURIWA said in a statement signed by Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko its national coordinator, and the National Media Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, and made available to DAILY POST.\n\nHURIWA said it believes that \u201cmembers of the security forces or foreign mercenaries hired by Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, angered by the anti- open grazing legislations in the South East and are now on a mission to start off a civil war by attacking peaceful cattle owners just so the North will boil in anger and to transfer the aggression and reprisals on peaceful Igbo citizens of Nigeria living legitimately with their Northern brothers/sisters.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to be a statesman and douse the rising tension by releasing the wrong lyrics detained leader of the now proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and initiate broad-based National reconciliation and constructive dialogues among ethnicities to promote National integration and unity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHURIWA said it believes that the alleged ill advised decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to clamp down militarily on the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is the fundamental cause of the security crisis in the southeast because diverse groups with divisive agenda are now seeking to stoke up the embers of disunity.\n\n\u201cThe video recordings of some of the attackers are everywhere. We do not think the Eastern Security Network or the now proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) are responsible for the Abia attacks. We believe even strongly that FIFTH columnists are out to destabilize the South East of Nigeria,\u201d the group said.\n\nHURIWA explicitly alleged that the South East of Nigeria is under attacks by outsiders who want to cash in on the nebulous anti-cow posture of IPOB to attack northerners in the east so as to achieve their dare devil agenda and the silence and willful inability of Nigeria\u2019s security forces to uncover who the unknown gunmen are points to a larger conspiratorial plots against the South East of Nigeria by enemies of the Igbos\u201d.\n\nHURIWA recalled that the Abia State Government had confirmed the reported attack by yet-to-be identified gunmen on the newly constructed cattle market in Omumauzor in Ukwa West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAn unspecified number of people were reportedly killed during the deadly attack that occurred late Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man and woman are the most peaceful and hospitable citizens and are not known for carrying out bloody violence on their visitors who live amongst them. The Northerners living in the East are like every Igbo person and so the Igbos respects the sanctity of life,\u201d the group said.",

          "title": "Again, NNPC Apologises to Nigerians, Reveals Five Vessels of Substandard Fuel Rejected",
          "text": "\u2022Assures petrol supply will be restored next week\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nGroup Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday apologised to Nigerians for damages caused by the importation of substandard fuel into the country. Kyari assured Nigerians that normalcy would return to petrol stations by next week, saying the national oil company has taken necessary steps to restore supply in the country.\n\nKyari spoke this in Abuja while addressing the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, during an investigative hearing on the importation of methanol-blended petrol.\n\nHowever, in a bid to end the fuel scarcity and clear the long queues at filling station in many parts of the country, petroleum products marketing companies, under the umbrella of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), have extended their opening hours in their jetties, depots and filling stations to a minimum of 18 hours.\n\nKyari said with at least 2.1 billion litres of petrol in stock, the fuel queues would end by next week.\n\nThe NNPC boss disclosed that given the current situation, five other vessels conveying their next supply had been rejected and were not allowed to sail into the country\u2019s waters because they were coming from the same shipping terminal that sent the four substandard cargos. He stressed that the current challenge was because Nigeria imported all gasoline.\n\nKyari said, \u201cNot a single litre of petrol is generated in the country, that means 100 per cent of petrol you see in this country is imported. Those imports are done on the basis of existing contractual arrangements that we have. It is called the direct sale- direct purchase process, which is simply with the best of practice to enable our suppliers supply products to us on agreed terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing this since I came on board and its part of our supply mechanism. Even if all our refineries come up today, except Dangote Refinery, we will still be in short supply of premium motor spirit (PMS), because all of our refineries can only make 18 million litres of gasoline. Consumption is certainly above 18million litres.\u201d\n\nKyari further explained that the four cargoes that in question met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and convey into ship.\n\nWhile noting that there was no way, based on the current specifications, that they would know that the PMS contained methanol, as it was not part of their requirements at the load port, Kyari assured that they have been able to trace all the volumes and quarantine them accordingly.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy law, NNPC is required to ensure energy security. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide energy security for this country. This company must operate within the laws of this country and this is what we have always done, and this is what we will continue to do.\n\n\u201cFor this current situation, I assure you that we have taken every necessary step to restore supply into this country. We have placed orders significant enough for us to cross into March, with at least 2.1 billion litres of PMS in our custody. The situation you are seeing today I can assure you that by next week, it will vanish.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, because of distribution issues that we may not have control over, including the movement of trucks, otherwise, we have robust supply arrangement to make sure that we exit this issue.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of those contracts, our suppliers bring products to us and we reconcile with them regularly. Part of those supply arrangements is to give specification to your suppliers. These specifications are bound by regulation and the latest that we are using is the one that is in place since 2006.\n\n\u201cThe current specifications we have is what is the subject of all our import arrangement. So all our partners were given those specifications and on the basis of this, those imports were made. Before a vessel leaves the load port, they have to declare that those vessels meet our specification; they will send it to the importer and confirm that it is the specification. On the basis of that, you allow the sail away of the vessel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cNow, once it comes to the country, two things happen. We have NNPC surveyors, who are now also required to validate that this product that we have meets the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cAlso we have the regulatory authority who has to conduct an independent assessment to confirm that this product meets the specification that is in consonance with the existing regulation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn case of all the problems we have seen, four of the cargoes that are particularly in question today met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and conveyed into ship.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way, based on the current specification, that you will know these PMS contains methanol. It is not part of their requirements at the load port. So we did not ask them to declare whether it contains methanol because it is not part of our specification.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that methanol is not contamination, it is a regular addictive to PMS. In China, up to 15 per cent PMS contain methanol. On its own it is not a contamination, the key issue is handling methanol. If we knew we will not accept this. Anytime methanol comes in contact with water it emulsifies, it turns into a different chemical.\u201d\n\nKyari lamented that one of the challenges NNPC faced was lack of tracking mechanism to track trucks leaving the depot. He said this had aided smuggling, as some of the fuel was transported to places that might not be in this country.\n\nThe GMD disclosed that NNPC had filed litigation against importers of the methanol-blended PMS considering the effect of the withdrawing the products across the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat did we do? We have put all our suppliers who are our contacts or commercial angle on notice that there would be liquidated damages that will come from this. And also it is typical practice that we compile liquidated damages that the direct supplier did not cost, he will transfer that to the next person until it gets to the originating supplier, so it is a back-to-back arrangement.\n\n\u201cThat is always done so that once you file, it will get to the last one. I do not know how many people are in the chain because this PMS supply business in one cargo you can have three sellers, you can have two, and you may have only one.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House committee, Hon. Adediji Olamide, in his submission, said ignorance was not an excuse in law. Olamide said the committee would need a lot of documentation that NNPC.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, noted that the investigative hearing was to ensure that the culprits were brought to book as well as make recommendations towards curbing a reoccurrence of the incident.\n\nHe stated that the task ahead was challenging, including examining the lessons, proffering solutions and way forward, and rejigging supply and regulating the system to make them more effective and efficient.\n\nOil Marketers Move to Clear Fuel Queues, Extend Opening Period to 24 hours\n\nMeanwhile, MOMAN said where possible, its members would extend their opening hours up to 24 hours a day in high density and flagship locations where the security situation permitted. The association stated that its members \u201cshall operate these extended hours until the excessive queues subside.\u201d\n\nThe association made this known yesterday in a statement signed by its Chairman and Managing Director of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun. The statement added that it was working with the regulatory authorities and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards a resolution of the current fuel crisis.\n\nAdeosun said MOMAN\u2019s subject matter experts were active contributors to the technical and commercial committees\u2019 set up by the regulatory authorities to re-stock fuel supplies, resolve the blending of contaminated product and identify losses suffered by customers, operators and third parties.\n\nHe said MOMAN members were also working with designated laboratories to double-check the quality of product (re-blended or new) before they are released into the fuels supply chain.\n\nMost importantly, Adeosun maintained that MOMAN members had committed resources towards enhanced operations and associated activities to reduce the burden of the current fuel scarcity to customers.\n\nThe association urged its customers not to engage in panic buying, as it might take a few days for normalcy to return, stressing that panic buying increases the pressure on the supply chain.\n\nNANS Condemn Attempts to Instigate Crisis, Attack NNPC\n\n,The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned an alleged attempt by some unscrupulous elements to hijack the adulterated fuel saga and resultant fuel scarcity to engage in a protest aimed to instigate crisis in the country and damage the reputation of the NNPC Limited.\n\nNANS also bemoaned the serious fuel supply disruption across the country occasioned by the importation of bad petrol, allegedly, by some approved dealers of the NNPC.\n\nThe students\u2019 body, in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its National President, Asefon Sunday, and Secretary General, Adekitan Lukman, said it was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain individuals had mobilised civil society organisations (CSOs) to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nWhile acknowledging the avoidable situation the country had been plunged into as a result of the fuel supply disruption, NANS frowned on those it claimed wanted to make political gain out of a purely operational issue, urging them to have a rethink.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWhile we acknowledge the avoidable situation we are in as a country after almost six years of no queues and scarcity, we frown on those who want to make political gain out of a purely operational issue and urge those behind the attempt to put a spanner in the smooth administrative structure of President Muhammadu Buhari at the NNPC to desist forthwith.\n\nNANS was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain enemies of the Kyari leadership wanted to use the petrol scarcity as a excuse to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nThe association demanded a speedy resolution of all issues and the normalisation of fuel supply across the country to ameliorate the hardship being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nNANS, however, commended the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari for an inquiry into the dire fuel importation mishap, which has put a strain on the supply chain and on Nigerians, saying it hoped the inquiry would be decisive and far-reaching.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Leaders now considering March\n\n\u2022Mustapha: February 26 sacrosanct\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe forthcoming convention of the All Progressive Congress (APC) has split governors elected under the political party into three different groups.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while the group of second term governors want the convention to hold as planned and are assiduously working towards settling for a candidate; the second group which is made up of mainly first term governors want the convention either postponed and a mechanism to return the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee designed so that Buni can continue. On the other hand, a third group of governors also want the convention to hold, and for Buni to continue or the convention postponed.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt that President Muhammadu Buhari met with Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi before he travelled on the matter, and the decision they both arrived yet to be disclosed.\n\nNevertheless, due to the development, there is palpable tension, apprehension, and misgivings in the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) over the choice of a consensus national chairman for the APC as there were also indications last night that the leadership of the party had begun to consider March for a possible new date for its national convention, earlier slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nBut one of the frontrunners for the chairmanship position, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, told THISDAY yesterday that the February 26 remained \u201csacrosanct\u201d. Mustapha said with the kind of energy the caretaker committee was devoting to preparations for the convention he believed they knew what to do.\n\nMustapha told THISDAY, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dispute or argue over speculation, since they have not come out officially to say it will hold or it will not hold. For now, we will still retain earlier information that February 26 is sacrosanct. So, if anything is contrary to that, we will have to wait for the official channel of the party to report it to all of us.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, the interim national leadership of the party was forced to fix February 26 for the convention, after pressure from the APC governors and other aggrieved stakeholders, who had expressed their displeasures over foot-dragging on the matter.\n\nA crucial meeting between Buhari and the APC governors to fine-tune the zoning of offices and other matters during the convention could not hold on Tuesday as the president met with only Fayemi on behalf of the governors.\n\nThe meeting with the APC governors to fine-tune zoning, was to enable the president disclose his preferred chairmanship aspirant to the governors and pave the way for the zoning of other National Working Committee (NWC) offices.\n\nExplaining why the meeting did not hold as scheduled, a source in the presidency told THISDAY yesterday in Abuja that Buhari told some governors, who met with him individually that there was nothing on ground to suggest that the Buni committee was preparing for the national convention.\n\nThe president, who left for Brussels to attend an African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) summit, had met with some of the governors, who had arrived at the villa early for the botched meeting.\n\nThe governors included Ben Ayade (Cross River), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Simeon Lalong (Plateau), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nThe inside source stated, \u201cWe are now looking at March for possible date for the national convention. Like the president said, there is nothing on ground to convince us that the caretaker committee is ready for the convention on February 26.\n\n\u201cFirst, the committee has not been able to come out with a zoning formula for the various positions in the party. And we cannot go into the convention without all these things well-spelt out.\u201d\n\nBoth Uzodimma and Ayade also hinted on Tuesday that the convention date was not sacrosanct.\n\nThe insider explained further that the Buni committee might have deliberately been pussyfooting around the convention because they had all long planned to hold the national convention and the presidential primaries the same day.\n\nA presidency source stated, \u201cThe committee wants to also be the one to conduct the presidential primary, but conducting the national convention on February 26 means that there will be a new national executive committee in place to conduct the presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the agenda of Mai Mala Buni-led committee. As I speak with you, the APC governors and other entrenched interest groups within the party are divided on the matter\n\n\u201cSome governors, who met with the president on Tuesday, asked him who was his preferred chairmanship candidate. But, as usual, the president refused to disclose his interest. He only requested for the list of the 12 aspirants. And their names have been forwarded to the relevant security agencies for scrutiny.\n\n\u201cHowever, the near consensus is that the national chairman of the party should go to the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nBut speaking with THISDAY, Mustapha said he did not want to dispute or speculate on a new date for the convention, since the party had not come out with an official statement on the issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you notice, the trend in the APC, even when the governors met the other time, is that none of them has the authority to pronounce certain things unless endorsed by the authorised organ, and that was why Governor Mai Mala Buni was the one that spoke and gave a specific date for the convention. He is the chairman of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cSo, I will want to restrict myself to waiting for the official right channel to instruct or to indicate where we stand. As at today, I want to believe the convention is going to take place on February 26.\u201d\n\nAsked to rate his chances in the race, the APC national chairmanship hopeful said, \u201cI believe my chances are very bright and the sky is the limit for me. It has been very positive. Among 11 or 12 of us, we do not see it as a do-or-die affair. We have always approached each other as brothers in this game.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I just came across two of my fellow contestants now and the way we were laughing, hugging, playing, was amazing. For us, it is a family affair that can easily be resolved, because for us, we know what it is to have gotten to this point in our journey, and we would try to see that all hands are on deck so as to come out victorious and be able to continue from the gains already recorded by the present administration ably led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAPC Governors Bicker over Consensus Option\n\nAhead of the planned convention, there appears to tension and cracks in different camps of the PGF over the choice of a consensus national chairman\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the cracks followed a meeting between the governors of Kebbi State and Jigawa State, Atiku Bagudu and Mohammed Badaru, respectively, who were said to have secretly presented their choice of a consensus national chairman to Buhari, without the knowledge of the other governors.\n\nIt was learnt that the two governors met with the president last week, where they sold the idea of Senator Sani Musa as a consensus national chairman of the APC. But other APC governors on hearing of the meeting rejected the choice of Musa, and insisted it was not made with their consent.\n\nBuhari was said to have clearly told Bagudu and Badaru that due process should be followed in picking the consensus chairman. The president, it was gathered, further told them to meet with Buni and other members to agree on the options that met his criteria.\n\nBut the crisis rocking APC, insiders said, was compounded by the inability of the convention committee to announce a zoning formula for the national convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022How he earned loyalty of IRT operatives\n\n\u2022Marwa: His arrest a clear message of NDLEA\u2019s commitment\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe police report on the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, which was submitted to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, (SAN), concluded that the conduct of the police officer violated the law and code of conduct for law enforcement officers.\n\nThe report maintained the embattled officer violated the law and the code of law enforcement officers in his dealings with internet fraudster, Ramon Olarewaju aka Hushpuppi, adding that a total of N279.120m flowed into Kyari\u2019s younger brother\u2019s bank account at various times.\n\nAlso, more details have emerged on how Kyari earned the undying loyalty of operatives of the elite group, the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), a relationship he was said to have built way back.\n\nBut the Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen Buba Marwa (retd), has said the arrest of Kyari, was a clear message that no one would be spared in the agency\u2019s ongoing war against illicit drug business.\n\nHowever, the police report frowned at Kyari\u2019s conduct in \u201chobnobbing with suspected fraudsters and people of questionable means in his capacity as a senior police officer and the head of the IRT.\n\n\u201cHe had also violated the provisions of the Social Media policy (SMP) for the Nigeria Police Force by responding to the FBI\u2019s indictment on his Facebook page without recourse to laid down procedure and also by his admission of broadcasting pictures and video clips to his contacts on social media.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, he violated the Nigeria Police Code of Professional Ethics by accepting complaints on such without recourse to established protocols. His claim that he forwarded an investigation report to the office of the Inspector-General of Police was established to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThe officer again violated the Code of Professional Ethics and the Nigeria Police Act 2020 by detaining Vincent Kelly Chibuzor for over a month in the cell without valid court order, without due regards to his fundamental human rights\u201d.\n\nThe report further observed that all the four witnesses brought by Kyari, namely, Usman Ibrahim Wazin Sikiry Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus, were all accomplices and formed part of the internet fraud.\n\nThe report cited the advice of the AGF, which stated that a prima facie case was established against him.\n\n\u201cThat there exists prima facie case of conspiracy, collaboration, receipt, conversion, transfer and/or retention of proceeds of unlawful activities contrary to the provision of Section 15, 17 &18 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2004 and Section 17 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Est) Ac Cap Ef Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 against DCP Abba Kyari and other suspects in view of the overwhelming evidence showing the nature of his disguised financial transactions and activities with Abbas Hushpuppl, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Weazirl, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus who are all confirmed members of international internet fraud network.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Honourable Attorney-General\u2019s advice is inconclusive as to whether based on the above quoted paragraph the officer can be proceeded against by way of or administrative sanctions. This is in view of the further stated advice of the AG that;\n\n\u201cAlthough the facts and circumstances of this case as contained in the case file are suggestive to money laundering offences against DCP Abba Kyarl and his accomplices namely: Abbas Hushpuppi, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Wazirl, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus.\n\n\u201cIn order to successfully prosecute them, there is a need for a more thorough dissecting and tracing of the suspected proceeds of crime received by DCP Abba Kyari, directly or indirectly through the said accomplices.\u201d\n\nThe report revealed how members of a syndicate led by international scammer, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi paid N235, 120, 000 to a younger brother to Kyari, adding that the suspended police officer equally funnelled N44m to his brother\u2019s bank account in multiple transactions.\n\nThe investigation report, which was submitted to the Attorney-General of the Federation disclosed that a total of N279.120m flowed into Kyari\u2019s younger brother\u2019s bank account at various times from the cyber scam syndicate members, notably, Efe Martins, Sikiru Adekoya, Usman Ibrahim, and Hussaini Ala.\n\n\u201cSikiru Adekoya has at many times received money from Hushpuppi and Efe and has equally transferred money to Usman Ibrahim. Adekoya after initial denial of having any financial transaction with both Hushpuppi and Efe Martins, eventually admitted receiving various sums of money through transfers into his GTBank.\n\n\u201cHowever, he could not offer reasonable explanations of what the sums were meant for and what he did with the monies. The network of Hushpuppi Internet fraud syndicate consists of Efe Martins as the lead coordinator, who through his company, Efe Martins Integrated Concept Ltd., has at various times transferred different sums of money to Sikiru Adekoya, Usman Waziri Ibrahim, Hussaini Ala.\n\n\u201cA junior brother to DCP Kyari is a major beneficiary of funds from the Zenith Bank account of Hussaini Ala from where he at different times received various sums totaling N218, 120, 000. He also received the sum of N44m in multiple transactions from DCP Abba Kyari,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHow Kyari Earned Loyalty of His Boys\n\nHowever, despite his suspension, Kyari still had his hold on the operatives and called the shots under the table through his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, who was also seconded to Disu.\n\nThe IRT, an elite unit set up by then Inspector General of Police, was to tackle high profile crimes like kidnapping and even terrorism.\n\nHeaded then by Kyari, the team soon made its mark as a squad that was out to tackle crime given the constant arrests and the category of cases they busted.\n\nBut Kyari did not come upon such a team by happenstance; he had groomed them from Lagos, when he was the commander in charge-of-the-state (Special Anti Robbery Squad SARS), although now disbanded.\n\nWhile at SARS, the team forged stronger through cracking cases but were at different times accused of extra judicial killings and other allegations of fraud and obtaining money from families of suspects to release them.\n\nThe case that brought him to national limelight was that of Evans Onwuamadike, the \u2018Billionaire kidnapper\u2019, who was arrested by Kyari and his team.\n\nAlthough the ground work that led to his arrest was done by DCP Tunji Disu, who was at that time the Commander of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) with support from then Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, Kyari and men took the glory and promotions that came with it.\n\nBut the high profile arrest was tainted by how Kyari\u2019s men allegedly re-looted the loot Evans obtained from his victims, forcefully.\n\nDuring the raid, the operatives were alleged to have packed both local and foreign currencies, exotic phones, designer wristwatches, jewelry, television and even glass cups.\n\nIn a petition by Evans through his lawyers, he accused Kyari and men of forcibly taking N50 million from him and N5million from his wife under the pretext that he would be released on bail.\n\nEvans also deposed in the affidavit that he was dispossessed of $10,000 by the same police officers.\n\nFor each operation, the bond between Kyari and men forged stronger as they weathered one allegation after the other.\n\nIt was part of measures by the police hierarchy to cut the seeming excesses of the group that IRT alongside the STS, was integrated into the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) headed by Ibrahim Lamorde.\n\nIn spite of that move, the team was still dogged with countless petitions and allegations of human rights abuse and corruption. Yet, there was seemingly nothing much the authorities could do because of the godfathers said to be behind Kyari.\n\nBut following his suspension by the PSC on the recommendation of the present IGP, Baba, over the Hushpuppi case, it seemed he was finally caged.\n\nUnbeknownst to the police hierarchy, he was still calling the shots at the IRT despite the capable hands of DCP Tunji Disu, who was detailed by the IG to take over the unit.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that Kyari was still carrying out discreet illegal operations through his then deputy, who was as well seconded to Disu, when he assumed office.\n\nA senior officer, who spoke on anonymity to THISDAY from the force headquarters said when Ubua was questioned by the IG, he said he was forced to obey orders from Kyari, because the suspended DCP assured him he would soon be reinstated by the force.\n\nBut when the NDLEA authorities briefed the IG on the case against Kyari and his men, they were all invited for questioning and Disu said he handed over to his deputy, because he had an operation to carry out in Sokoto.\n\nThis much was confirmed by the deputy, who said he carried out the operation without informing the head of the unit on the request of Kyari.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe force is at a terrible spot at the moment. How did DCP Kyari think for a moment that he would be reinstated after the FBI fiasco? Who was giving him such assurance? It was a stunned IG, who heard that he kept assuring his boys that DCP Disu would be removed and he would be reinstated.\n\n\u201cThat, however, does not exonerate ACP Ubua, who should know better than to place loyalty to man over the police force he pledged to serve. The only good thing that came out from this was that the IG finally signed the appeal by DCP Disu to allow him raise his own team and not use those inherited from his predecessor.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY carried out subsequent checks on what gave Kyari such hopes that he would be cleared as usual and reinstated despite the damning allegations by FBI.\n\nAnother source in the know said Kyari was parroting that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was behind his woes.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen the Hushpuppi incident happened, he reassured us that it would soon fizzle out and he would be reinstated. According to him, his woes were orchestrated by IPOB given that he had arrested some of them in different operations.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the FBI lawyer had Igbo affiliations and was probably sympathetic to the Biafra cause. So, we shouldn\u2019t worry, because his godfathers were on top of the case to get him reinstated.\u201d\n\nBut contrary to allegations that the police authorities had scrapped IRT and STS, the IG has set plans in motion to sanitise the units by posting fresh officers that would be ready to take instructions from their commander.\n\nMarwa: Kyari\u2019s Arrest, Clear Message NDLEA is Committed\n\nThe Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen Buba Marwa (retd), has said the arrest of Kyari, was a clear message that no one would be spared in the agency\u2019s ongoing war against illicit drug business.\n\nMarwa said this on Wednesday in an address in Abuja during a training on the Sensitization on Drugs and Drug Prevention, Treatment and Care (DPTC) organised by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) for NLDEA personnel and selected journalists.\n\nHe said the system could not allow those given the responsibility to fight crime, which included the matter of drugs, to themselves be proponents of it.\n\nThe anti-narcotics czar said the fight against drug abuse was serious business and the agency was committed to pursuing a drug-free nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe media has a very important role to play in our society. The business of getting information out needs to be accurate and professionally done especially, in the business of drug control, drug abuse, trafficking, there are technicalities that you need to get sufficient knowledge of the terrain so that when you get the word out, it is gotten out accurately,because you mould the opinions of millions. It is for this reason that I urge the journalists to please take this training seriously and take full advantage of it.\n\n\u201cWhile we are at it, there is an ongoing play, which we are witnessing and I have followed the role of the media even in it. It is a serious business that is ongoing. We all are responsible. We want a drug-free nation. We may not get to zero level, but definitely there is a certain minimum acceptability standard that we are all pursuing. And those given the responsibility to fight crime, which includes the matter of drugs cannot themselves be proponents of it. This message I believe we have sent abundantly clear.\u201d\n\nResponding, Country Representative of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Oliver Stolpe, said more is still required to be done in the fight against drug abuse.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think there is still more to be done, because I still believe that most Nigerians perceive drug use as more of a failure of some sorts, of basically those people that are using drugs.\n\n\u201cIt has not yet been fully appreciated that drug use is a health condition first and foremost and it is a health condition that affects this nation much more severely than I think there is a true awareness of.\u201d\n\nIG Wants CJN to Enable Law Dept in Police Academy\n\nIn a related development, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, yesterday, sought the collaboration of the Chief Justice of the Federation (CJN) to enable the accreditation of the law department of the Police Academy, Kano, to participate in the law school programme.\n\nThe IG made the call, when members of the force management team paid a courtesy visit to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, in his office at the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Abuja.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters said the visit was aimed at solidifying the synergy between the police and the judiciary as key players in the criminal justice system of the nation with a view to ensuring a smooth and efficient dispensation of justice.\n\n\u201cThe IG equally sought the collaboration of the CJN in accrediting the legal department of the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State to enable its graduates proceed for further studies at the Nigerian Law School.\n\n\u201cThe IGP emphasised that this will ensure the police have more lawyers within its pool to strengthen its prosecutorial duties and hopefully produce more Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) in the future\u201d, it said.\n\nThe CJN appreciated the visit which was the first of its kind ever by a sitting IG and commended Baba for his thoughtfulness, while expressing readiness to continually partner the Nigeria Police Force for seamless justice administration.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022At 200,000bpd, over $29bn lost to theft in six years\n\n\u2022Over N700bn expended on repairs, maintenance\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA combination of huge oil pipeline repairs cost and a high-level crude oil theft are bleeding the Nigerian economy, with losses amounting to at least $29 billion in the last six years, spanning 2015 to 2021.\n\nIn February last year, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited disclosed that the country lost an average of 200,000 barrels per day of its crude oil production to saboteurs and illegal pilfering by criminals. At the time, the national oil company\u2019s Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had said, \u201cWe have two sets of losses, one coming from our products and the other coming from crude oil. In terms of crude losses, it is still going on. On average, we are losing 200,000 bpd.\u201d Kyari said this in Abuja during a meeting with Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, to discuss collaborative efforts to curb the menace.\n\nThe amount, as revealed by Kyari, excluded NNPC\u2019s intermittent contracts for the rehabilitation of its downstream facilities, ranging from critical pipelines to depots and terminals, and the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) financing model, of which 96 companies from various jurisdictions indicated interest in 2021.\n\nAt the daily loss of 200, 000 barrels, it would be about 73 million barrels in a year and about 438 million barrels in six years under the current administration, to give roughly $29 billion when calculated over the period.\n\nA THISDAY analysis showed that at a projected 1.86 million barrels per day in 2021, the country recorded nearly 200 million barrels\u2019 crude deficit, out of a possible 700 million barrels yearly, in the first 11 months of the year.\n\nMoreover, statista.com, which tracks oil prices from 1960 till date, put the average price of oil per barrel in 2015 at $49.49, $40.76 in 2016, $52.51 in 2017, $69.78 in 2018, $64.04 in 2019, $41.47 in 2020, and $69.3 in 2021.\n\nUsing a median oil price of $64.5 for the six years multiplied by the 446.4 million barrels lost within the period, Nigeria lost approximately $29 billion in the last six years.\n\nIn 2021 alone, Nigeria was estimated to have lost as much as $4 billion, about 10 per cent of the country\u2019s foreign reserves, to oil theft, and also suffered a double jeopardy of spending its scarce resources on the maintenance of the incessantly breached oil assets.\n\nIn the last couple of months, due to its inability to ramp up production, despite growing international oil price, NNPC was only able to contribute N14 billion, N10.5 billion, and N20 billion, respectively, to the federation account, although it projected N209 billion monthly.\n\nRecently, THISDAY reported that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry had continued to haemorrhage, with the country losing as much as 6.596 million barrels in the December 2021 production circle. At an average of $75 per barrel for last month and a conservative official rate of N415/$1, Nigeria failed to take advantage of high international oil prices for the month, losing a whopping $487.5 million or roughly N202.3 billion.\n\nThe figures from NNPC indicated that the losses were due to a combination of factors, including force majeure declared by a Joint Venture (JV) partner. Other reasons listed by the national oil company included community issues, maintenance work, sabotage, and technical matters, like leakages, pressure build-up, and faulty valves.\n\nLamenting the huge hole the activities of oil thieves was digging in his company\u2019s revenue, Chairman of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu, a few days ago said the company, Heirs Oil and Gas, was losing as much as 50,000 barrels of crude oil to criminals daily. Speaking last week, during a lecture he delivered to members of Course 30 of the National Defence College on the theme, \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d Elumelu described the situation as a national disgrace.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, thieves take 50,000 per day and, to me, this requires a national seminar or dialogue.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it is one of the highest levels of threat to our country because it\u2019s so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate, the country is not safe. They do that to us; they do that to other operators also.\u201d\n\nElumelu added, \u201cWe look forward to men and women in this room who will help remove this national disgrace and problems that we face.\u201d\n\nIn December, according to a THISDAY analysis, some of the assets, which took the greatest hits, included Bonny, which haemorrhaged to the tune of 2.712 million barrels for the month due to the force majeure declared on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL).\n\nThe Urha terminal followed with 1.468 million barrel losses, which curtailed production within the period, thereby hobbling exports. For context, the loss from that particular terminal exceeded the country\u2019s production for the entire month.\n\nOdudu terminal also suffered the same fate due to decrease in production as a result of maintenance work on the Odudu and Ima terminal.\n\nFurthermore, Forcados shed 456,575 barrels of oil as a result of what NNPC described as community issues delaying reinstatement of the facility.\n\nBesides, Yoho dropped 420,000 barrels during the month owing to a faulty valve, Ajapa lost 30,000 barrels due to shutdown, while Aje terminal curtailed production within the period to the tune of 62,000 barrels.\n\nBrass was not spared as it suffered sabotage around Tebidada and Ogbaibiri flow stations as well as the valve issues, pressure build-up, high sand production, and leak repairs, resulting in a total loss of roughly 198,200 barrels.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) lamented that with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February, Nigeria was only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently. NUPRC stated that this was leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that literally translates to roughly about $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that actually requires these funds,\u201d the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, stated.\n\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\n\n\u201cBut the larger percentage is due to crude oil theft and as a commission we know the impact of this and recognising our regulatory role, we have been able to reach out to other operators as to what we can do about this,\u201d he added.\n\nA former Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Waziri Adio, speaking on the matter recently, stressed that since Nigeria first reported oil losses, the situation had escalated and was taking its toll on the country.\n\nIn a period of 10 years, he stated, an analysis by NEITI put losses to oil theft at $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year. He said aside its economic implications the losses also had security ramifications.\n\nAdio said, \u201cThis is something that causes a lot of risks, not just financially but also security wise. There are implications for the environment; there are implications for the Niger Delta, for health and safety.\n\n\u201cMost of the measures that have been put in place are not enough. They are inadequate and actually the problem is getting worse at a time when the country is in a very hard place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have never had it this bad. Something really is going on. The enforcement of the law is very weak, the surveillance mechanism is weak, the security apparatus is also not clearly focused.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing in terms of technology, we are just scratching the surface. The problem is not new. It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s getting worse and it\u2019s getting worse because we have not done enough to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBut aside the huge losses to oil theft, there\u2019s also the cost of repairing the lines when they are breached.\n\nLast year, the federal government said, through its spokesman, Mr. Lai Mohammed, that the government was spending N60 billion to repair and maintain vandalised oil and gas pipelines annually.\n\nThe minister, who spoke in July 2021 at a town hall meeting on protecting oil and gas infrastructure in Abuja, said between January 2019 and September 2020, 1,161 pipeline points across the country were vandalised.\n\n\u201cWith an average of 200,000 barrels per day lost to the wanton damage to pipelines and a huge amount of N60 billion yearly to repair and maintain the vandalised points, one can only imagine the impact on the economy,\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nHowever, THISDAY checks revealed that this figure might be lower than what obtained in reality.\n\nData independently obtained from NNPC indicated that between January and December 2015, N103.4 billion was spent on pipeline repairs and management. From January to August 2015 alone, over 1,824 cases of breaks were reported on the pipelines.\n\nIn all, the government appears helpless, despite attempts in the past to reduce the incidence of vandalism and oil theft.\n\nBefore the Buhari administration, the preceding government had devised a strategy of hiring community members as guards, mostly hiring warlords from the areas who in turn hired those to be deployed at the facilities.\n\nIn 2011, reports said the federal government signed pipeline protection contracts worth at least $39.5 million a year with local guards. But NNPC\u2019s own data indicated that losses actually went up after the new contracts commenced.\n\nBut when Buhari took over, he frowned on the arrangement, put a halt to it, and literally described it as an insult to the Nigerian Armed Forces. He believed it insulted the security services that gang leaders were trusted to secure the country\u2019s assets, despite the existence of the armed forces.\n\nNeither Buhari\u2019s strategy, nor those of the presidents before him has worked.\n\nThe situation worsened in 2016, when the federal government spent N112 billion attempting to fix the problem, rising about N9 billion from the previous year.\n\nIn that year, N14 billion was incurred in February, N14.8 billion in July, and N14.9 billion in August. The lowest amount of N880 million was spent in January before aggrieved Niger Delta militants virtually brought the industry to its knees.\n\nAt least 2,560 vandalised points were recorded between January and December of that year. A check further showed that in 2017, N129.87 billion was spent on the phenomenon, while N137.44 billion was expended in 2018. But in 2019, the cost was reported as N127 billion.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the cost of repairs reduced considerably to N60.5 billion, and further fell to 29.5 billion in 2021, the least spending in years. The fall in the cost of repairs may not be unconnected with the fact that many of the pipes have now been abandoned.\n\nWhile oil theft is not a new phenomenon, with countries like Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Mozambique, Mexico, Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Turkey experiencing different levels of theft, the volumes from Nigeria remain incredibly high.\n\nFor instance, while the stealing of oil across the global industry averaged 70,000 bpd of crude output in August 2020, Nigeria experienced significantly higher losses, with theft estimated at 200,000 barrels per day.\n\nHowever, it is believed that access to oil pipelines in Nigeria is markedly easier due to alleged connivance of top security operatives, ageing infrastructure, community acquiescence, as well as a complex web of complicity by contractors and oil companies\u2019 staff who gain when the pipelines are breached.\n\nWhile it is difficult to establish what happens on the high seas, where vessels allegedly load crude oil without requisite papers under the watchful eyes of the security operatives, those in the know insist that the high volume of the commodity moved out of the Niger Delta illegally would not be possible without connivance from top security agents.\n\nLeader of the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) and a coalition of nine other militant groups in the Niger Delta, self-styled Johnmark Ezon-Ebi, in a chat with THISDAY earlier had alleged that high-ranking officials of government and security agencies were the major illegal oil \u2018bunkerers\u2019, who stole crude oil from Niger Delta and sold overseas through proxies.\n\nAn activist and National President of Ijaw Peoples Development Initiative (IPDI), Austin Ozobo, corroborated the claim and gave an insight into how the different categories of oil thieves in the region operated and settled security agents on the waterways.\n\nA legal practitioner and former President of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, said the connivance of security agents was well known. He added that his concerns were the effect of oil bunkering on the environment and the fact that due to joblessness, graduates had joined the oil bunkering business.\n\nIn the same vein, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State had also accused a serving General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division of the Nigerian Army of promoting oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nIn November last year, Wike again doubled down on the matter, alleging that the fight to stop oil theft had continued to fail because top-ranking military officers were involved.\n\nSince this year, Wike has repeatedly accused the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) of connivance. In one instance, the governor alleged that a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) actually owned one of the illegal refineries in the state.\n\nIn 2018, an indigenous oil company, Aiteo, took the unprecedented step of raising the alarm about security forces involvement in illegal oil bunkering and breaking of pipelines. It accused a then Joint Task Force (JTF) operating in the region of complicity.\n\nThese cases either went without investigation or the outcome of the investigations were not made public. However, the security forces have always denied involvement.\n\nNigeria has been unable to meet its allocation by OPEC, which was 1.68 million bpd for January 2022 and 1.701 million barrels per day for February, and barely exceeded 1.25 million bpd in the last few months.\n\nAlthough questions remain over the real motives for planning to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, a handful of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria have cited costs related to oil pipelines and general insecurity as reasons for their actions.\n\nFigures from NNPC indicated that the country lost 42.25 million barrels in 2019, and 53.28 million barrels in the year prior, owing to oil theft, but the situation might have worsened in 2021.\n\nNEITI, the country\u2019s oil industry auditor, in 2019, suggested the country had lost around 138,000 bpd of crude to theft over the previous decade, at a value of around $40.06 billion.\n\nDespite several efforts, including the setting up of a special security outfit, Operation Delta Safe, a coalition of all the security agencies in the country, and the establishment of several committees, including the one for recovery of crude oil and illegally refined petroleum products, the results have been largely negative.\n\nIn response to a query raised in a 2016 report of the Auditor General for the Federation (AuGF), NNPC had put the money spent on pipeline repairs within five years as well as the money lost as a result of product losses at N966 billion. The corporation said the N966 billion expenses and losses were incurred between 2010 and 2015.\n\nBut a senate panel had insisted on probing NNPC for an alleged failure to remit N4 trillion into the federation account as contained in the AuGF report.\n\n\u201cAside the above, pipeline repairs and products losses so incurred stood at N966 billion for the same period,\u201d it stated in the defence.\n\nIn June last year, NNPC began collaborating with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), and NSCDC to try to curb the menace. That move has also been largely unfruitful.\n\nBut NNPC has always insisted that working with the local communities would be one of the most effective ways to halt the theft of crude oil and vandalism of the country\u2019s pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is continuously working in collaboration with the local communities and other stakeholders to reduce and eventually eliminate the pipeline vandalism menace,\u201d the company said in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR).\n\nHowever, a Pricewaterhouse Coopers forensic audit, which reviewed and analysed pipeline repairs spending claimed by NNPC found that most of the expenses were \u201cunsubstantiated costs\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sends N2.557trn supplementary budget for petrol subsidy \u2022Asks Senate to amend 2022 Appropriation Act\n\nSunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akojie in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday criticised the National Assembly for removing crucial projects from the 2022 budget estimates sent to it by the executive and inserting the lawmakers\u2019 projects to the tune of N887 billion in the fiscal document before it was signed into law.\n\nHe also accused the federal lawmakers of making unnecessary incursion into the operational areas of the executive.\n\nThis was just as the president has asked the National Assembly to amend the 2022 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly in December, 2021.\n\nThe requests were contained in a letter dated February 10, 2022, and read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari in the letter, he also said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nHe lamented that 139 out of the 254 projects in the budget totaling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe president, therefore, requested the National Assembly to amend the Appropriation Act to provide for capital expenditure in the sum of N106,161,499,052 billion; and N43,870,592,044 billion for recurrent expenditure.\n\nHe also requested that an additional provision for N2.557 trillion be appropriated by the National Assembly to fund the petrol subsidy in the 2022 budget framework which was revised to provide fully for PMS subsidy.\n\nBuhari stressed the need to reinstate four capital projects totaling N1.4 billion in the executive proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources.\n\nHe said N22 billion should be cut from the provision for the Sinking Fund to retire mature loans needed to meet government\u2019s obligations under already Issued Bonds.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital projects that are replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act. 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSome significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation\n\n\u201cThere are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant Committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to restore the titles / descriptions of 32 projects in the Appropriation Act to the titles contained in the Executive Proposal for the Ministry of Water Resources (see Schedule IV) in furtherance of our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects.\n\nThe president also sought the approval of the federal parliament for a fresh request of N150 billion.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth.\u201d\n\nThe president said the N2.557 trillion fresh requests was to enable the federal government to subsidise petrol from June to December this year.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the suspension of the petrol subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy.\n\n\u201cAn additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2 trillion while FGN\u2019s share from the account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the amount available to fund the federal budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Crucially, this applies not only to people playing games, but also those willing to pay as well,\u201d said Carry1st CEO and Co-founder, Cordel Robbin-Coker.\n\nCrypto adoption and gaming in Africa\n\nAlready, 63 million of the 186 million gamers, pay for games with these African figures projected to be the fastest-growing in the world as the continent also begins adoption of digital currencies.\n\nAnother research by Newswagg\u2019s points to a growing appetite for trading in gaming assets using digital currencies with 38 percent of 41.9 million gamers owning crypto across the world being millennials aged 21-38 years old.\n\nAfrica and the Middle East have a combined 5.9 million gamers owning Crypto, with a potential to shore up these numbers in Africa given that the continent will have one of the largest youthful populations by 2050.\n\nAccording to Newswagg\u2019s, 80 percent gamers with crypto accounts are interested in using digital currency for gaming purchases, with 67 percent yearning for an opportunity to use cryptocurrency in gaming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an immense potential for crypto to be more involved in the gaming industry,\u201d says the report.\n\nGlobal crypto gaming was valued at 321 million US dollars in 2020.\n\nNigeria has leaped ahead of its African peers in adoption of cryptocurrencies following the launch of Africa\u2019s first Central Bank-backed digital currency- the e-Naira in 2021.\n\nWhile Kenya is yet to launch its own regulated digital currency, it tops the world in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trade.\n\nSouth Africa is currently in the piloting stage of its project, Dunbar- that will support cross border payments with Mauritius getting closer to piloting now in the development stage.\n\nSix other African countries including Tunisia, Ghana and Morocco are still conducting research on regulated digital currencies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside NVIDIA plans to develop Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem",
          "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies have the potential to inspire growth and solve problems in Africa, yet Africa still struggles to get itself into the conversation.\n\nThis is concerning because AI relies on data, and when the appropriate social, cultural, and political contexts are not provided, it can entrench existing inequalities, prejudices, and injustices. For example, a paper written by computer scientists, Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini showed how facial recognition software was less accurate when identifying women and people of colour compared to white men.\n\nAccording to Tortoise Intelligence, globally, AI companies attracted $77.5 billion investment last year, a 115% increase from the $36 billion recorded in the year before that. This represents the growing interest in AI from investors and governments, which can be traced from COVID-19, the report noted. But, in Africa, a large part of the ecosystem\u2019s investments is concentrated in very few startups. In 2019, Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem raised $11.27 million\u2014up by 223% from the $3.6 million in 2018\u2014and Tunisia\u2019s InstaDeep $7 million raise represents 62% of the total investment made that year in the ecosystem. Similarly, in 2020, South Africa\u2019s DataProphet $6 million accounted for half of the $11.63 million raised, solidifying South Africa as the hub of AI development on the continent.\n\nMichael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, explained that a sudden need for digital collaborative spaces and remote working tools during the pandemic forced business leaders to understand the need for digitisation, and this demand included further investments in AI and automation. Unsurprisingly, a CNBC survey revealed that 81% of executives worldwide believe AI will play a prominent and critical role in how their business operates this year.\n\nLast month, all eyes were on Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem when Tunisian AI startup InstaDeep, which helps companies create decision making systems for solving real-world problems, raised a $100 million Series B funding, the biggest raise by an AI startup on the continent\u2014or by any startup from the region. InstaDeep was founded in 2014 by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim and bootstrapped until it received external funding in 2018.\n\nBut before then, in 2017, the startup joined NVIDIA\u2019s Inception Programme, a global programme designed to nurture AI and data science startups, as a Premier member. Through this programme, InstaDeep was able to buy its first NVIDIA DGX Station, an AI system that brings AI supercomputing to data science teams. The programme provided InstaDeep with marketing and technical support and introductions to help grow its network.\n\nFocus on Africa\n\nNVIDIA is one of the biggest chip makers in the world and is best known for its unique line of graphics processing units (GPU)\u2014a single-chip processor that handles mathematically intensive tasks in parallel, rather than serially, the way a CPU does. NVIDIA is also one of the leaders in deep learning, a key process to develop AI applications, and for years have supported AI developers with training, with, for example, its Deep Learning Institute, which offers learning resources that help individuals, teams, educators, students, and organisations advance their knowledge on AI.\n\nThe GPUs that NVIDIA creates were initially used to process pixels for 3D graphics, but in the last decade, because of its adept ability at processing data, it has become a tool AI researchers use for deep learning. Fast forward to today, NVIDIA has grown to become the pioneer of the modern AI, deep learning, and machine learning market. It allows developers, researchers, and scientists around the world to build applications for accelerated computing on top of its platform, including in Africa.\n\nNVIDIA expressed intentions to intensify its support for the African AI ecosystem when it hired Fatima Tambajang as its Head of Developer Relations for Africa. \u201cAfrica is a hugely important market for NVIDIA, which is why we are working within its developer ecosystem,\u201d NVIDIA said in an email.\n\nKate Kallot, Head of Emerging Areas, speaking about NVIDIA\u2019s work on the continent during last year\u2019s AI Expo, highlighted the work another Inception Programme member, South African AI startup, Aerobotics, is doing to help farmers protect their crops and maximise yields. Kallot revealed that Aerobotics has processed over 100 million trees across nearly 20 countries. The Inception Programme has also helped ATLAN Space create an AI-powered drone that scans thousands of square miles of ocean and detects illegal fishing boats and other environmental threats.\n\nKallot explained that in the US, AI and data science innovation are driven by Big Tech; in China, they are driven by government investments; and in Europe, it is by individual laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In Africa, however, none of this applies: innovation is driven by individual developers, grassroots communities, and startups.\n\nThis is why NVIDIA is taking a different approach to engage with Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem. Last year, NVIDIA launched the Emerging Chapters Programme\u2014specifically for Africa but is now expanding to other emerging markets\u2014to help these grassroots communities build and scale their AI and data science projects. NVIDIA partners with non-traditional pathway institutions and communities like Zindi, AI Centre of Excellence Kenya, and Data Science Nigeria.\n\nWhile these AI communities consist of individual developers, run their incubators, do their own AI research, and partner with the government and international organisations, NVIDIA provides them with workshops from its AI experts through the Deep Learning Institute Programme and ships its hardware to them.\n\n\u200bCiting an example of the progress the Emerging Chapter Programme has made, Kallot referred to Clinton Oduor, a computer science student at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (Dekut), who started as an AI and data science hobbyist but now leads the innovative tinyML Kenya community. Oduor and his team have built Makini, an offline learning device that uses speech to bring education to vulnerable children in remote areas through an interactive session at a low cost.\n\nA few years ago, in 2019, tech giant Google opened its first AI centre in Africa in Ghana\u2019s capital city, Accra. And now we have the trio of NVIDIA programmes: Inception, Deep Learning Institute, and Emerging Chapter working hand in hand to aid AI development in Africa.

          "title": "Is Africa\u2019s tech startup ecosystem set for a debt financing boom?",
          "text": "Last year, 37 African tech startups raised a total of $767 million in 43 debt rounds, indicating the rise of the debt funding class and increasing global lender confidence in African tech, per Partech\u2019s report on venture capital funding in Africa.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s tech ecosystem has set its sights on another asset class to help fuel growth,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWhile debt funding remains widely underreported and undisclosed, it is growing to prominence in the fundraising strategy of African startups.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Partech will be reporting on debt in its annual report. According to its findings, Nigerian startups raised 45% or $345 million of the total amount of debt recorded, the fintech sector accounted for over 54%, and there were 34 unique debt investors, with Lendable and the IFC being some of the most active.\n\n\u201cAs the [African tech startup] ecosystem matures, more companies will do a combination of debt and equity [funding rounds],\u201d said Dare Okoudjou, CEO and founder of MFS Africa in October 2021. Okoudjou\u2019s statement came after the pan-African fintech giant closed a $100 million Series C financing round\u2014split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt.\n\nMost startups looking to raise money during their formative years typically consider equity, which requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital. At that stage, the venture is extremely risky and thus doesn\u2019t appeal to most financing options (like debt that requires repayment at an agreed-upon date with interest) except venture capital.\n\n\u201cDebt investors usually look for predictable cash flows or transferable assets (such as real estate) to secure their exposures. For most startups, both of these are in short supply,\u201d Rahul Shah, Head of Financials Equity Research at Tellimer, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nBecause the majority of startups are early-stage, debt takes up a small slice of the broader market for private tech financing. According to Ayobamigbe Teriba, an ex-analyst at Ingressive Capital, debt financing is viable to businesses but tricky.\n\n\u201cA lot of [early-stage] companies don\u2019t consider it [debt] because of the criteria tied to accessing them, which is different from equity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it allows founders retain ownership, access criteria can be more tedious than equity funding that\u2019s been the anchor in the ecosystem and is based on stages of the startups.\u201d\n\nBut as an ecosystem matures and growing startups choose to stay private longer, funding alternatives like debt become viable and interest grows. \u201cAs startups grow and achieve some predictability, debt financing can be a useful instrument,\u201d the Partech report notes. \u201cIt helps accelerate growth while limiting dilution from equity rounds.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThere\u2019s no available data on how much debt African startups have attracted over the years. But several funding announcements last year\u2014when Africa\u2019s venture capital funding hit the $5 billion mark\u2014suggest 2021 saw an acceleration in serious appetite for debt financing. Apart from MFS Africa, Moove, Trella, and TradeDepot are some of the startups that announced debt rounds.\n\nBecause the ecosystem is at a stage where further financing is needed by many fast-growing startups, more debt financing announcements should be expected this year, predicts Kunle Akinola, an investment analyst at Lagos-based private equity firm Platform Capital.\n\n\u201cAfrica minted 5 new unicorns in 2021, which indicates growth. As a founder of one of these or another growth-stage company, you probably don\u2019t want to be issuing equity unnecessarily to finance acquisitions or capital expenses during growth and expansion,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nThe Partech report notes, In addition, that strategic debt players have launched dedicated debt funds targeted to emerging markets \u2013 Africa in particular.\n\nLast October, emerging markets-focused lender Lendable announced a plan to raise a $100 million fund targeting African and Asian fintech companies. It participated in MFS Africa\u2019s $100 million funding round with $30 million debt and has backed many startups in Africa.\n\nDevelopment finance institutions like the United Kingdom\u2019s CDC, the Dutch development bank, and the IFC are also leaders in this financing segment. The latter has so far deployed debt to back TradeDepot, Bolt, Kobo360, etc. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see a major uptick in the deployment of debt by existing players and new entrants,\u201d Teriba said.\n\nWith the growing uptick in debt funding activity in Africa, which companies are best suited for the financing option?\n\nPer Rahul Shah, industries with debt-friendly assets or business models have a better chance of accessing this financing source. \u201cFor example, financial companies looking to fund their lending, particularly where they can point to strong risk management to reduce the uncertainty in repayment cashflows,\u201d he said.\n\nIn MFS Africa\u2019s case, it raised debt funding to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements. \u201cWe realized we don\u2019t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that,\u201d the CEO said at the time.\n\nAnother emerging sector with access to debt financing is renewable energy: physical infrastructure (such as solar panels) and supply contracts can give debt investors the comfort that they will be repaid. In this space, West Africa-focused solar providers like Starsight and Daystar Power have largely leveraged debt to fund operations.\n\n\u201cIn such cases, debt financing can make more sense than equity financing; asset and liability cash flows are better-matched, and returns to equity-holders can be enhanced,\u201d the Tellimer head said.\n\nShort-term debt financing can also be accessed if it is backed by inventory; for example, e-commerce retailers and their suppliers. In contrast, companies with non-transferable intangible assets (such as early-stage biotech) would likely struggle to obtain debt finance.\n\nEssentially, debt is hinged on the cash flow or revenue models of companies. Once the models become reliable and the product-market fit is underlined, debt investors become more open to funding a startup.\n\nBased on the ongoing trend, Africa is poised to witness a surge in founders seeking debt financing for their startups in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe are starting from a very low base; in that sense, volumes can only increase from here,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAs the current cadre of African startups matures, they will become more attractive to debt investors given they have demonstrable track records. And as the continent\u2019s startup debt investors become more experienced, their risk appetite will improve.\u201d\n\nTeriba adds that more startups are likely to engage capital markets, institutional lenders for credit to \u201cexpand and stabilise their business offerings.\u201d\n\nWhile the near-term growth prospects are strong, a key medium-term headwind is the global monetary tightening cycle as developed countries, where the bulk of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from, roll back monetary measures meant to help businesses tide over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe era of cheap and plentiful money is coming to an end, and that will ultimately constrain end-investor appetite for the riskiest forms of debt,\u201d Shah added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nSo, anyone familiar with tertiary education in Nigeria knows about the striking tradition. Most government-run university students have lost blocks of time due to strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Under President Buhari\u2019s administration, students have lost 13 months to strikes.\n\nThere seems to be no respite in sight, and this week, the body declared a \u201ccomprehensive and total\u201d four-week strike. In a separate development, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, is embroiled in a dispute with ASUU over its decision to make Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Communication, Isa Pantami, a professor.\n\nWhile we hope that the strike ends quickly, we encourage students to use any opportunity to gain relevant skills while waiting for the strike to be called off. While you\u2019re here, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could take a minute to share this newsletter with at least three people on your contact list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The newsletter edition dated February 15, 2022, erroneously reported that the European Union plans to invest $927 billion under its global gateway initiative. The correct figure is $927 million.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest:\n\nLocal competition for Uber\n\nWasla\u2019s $9 million raise\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nLocal competition for Uber?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos is famous for many things. From its entrepreneurial spirit to dare-devil danfo drivers who will test your patience. But perhaps, its most notable feature is its traffic.\n\nWhile the British use the weather as a conversation starter, Nigerians use Lagos traffic to start conversations.\n\nLike any problem, the traffic situation has led various entrepreneurs to build solutions with local startups like Treepz, Touch and Pay, and Shuttlers joining foreign brands like Uber and Bolt to provide convenient transportation solutions.\n\nOne local player is Transtura, a mobility startup founded by Vincent Adeoba that provides a convenient mode of transportation using shuttle minibuses. What began from renting out his car to be used on Uber has grown into a startup serving 2,500 users. However, the company has not stopped there, recently acquiring W\u00e0z\u00f3 as it plans to roll out payment solutions.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo had a chat with the founders a few weeks ago, where they shared insights from their journey and plans for the future. You can read more about that here: Transtura\u2019s journey to digital payments; from launch to acquisition\n\nWasla bags $9 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Egyptian eCommerce companies burst onto the scene bagging huge investment rounds aided by rising Internet penetration rates and digitally savvy millennials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWasla is one of such startups, founded in 2018 by Serag Meneassy, Taymour Sabry, and Mahmoud El-Said. The startup has announced an investment of $9 million from Contact Financial Holding, a financial services provider in Egypt.\n\nThe startup offers its users a wide array of services enabling them to save while shopping. These services include a deal finder and cashback points that can be used for airtime and gift cards. Following the fresh injection of capital, the startup plans to introduce buy now, pay later options and a new online payment option for its users.\n\nWith 1.5 million downloads, Wasla is eyeing regional expansion with plans to expand to Nigeria. Speaking to TechCrunch, CEO El-Said said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market at the end of the day, you have roughly 250 million people. They\u2019re very technologically advanced, and their adoption of eCommerce is quite good.\u201d\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting payments is a significant challenge for businesses across the globe. With several payment providers, it is often difficult to harmonise a business\u2019 payment stack. In Europe and America, payment orchestration platforms have been built, providing a faster way for businesses to receive payments and easing the expansion process.\n\nMoneyHash, an Egyptian startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose after launching in 2021. The startup, which claims to be the first payment orchestration and revenue operations platform in the Middle East/Africa, raised its pre-seed round from investors including Nuwa Capital, First Check Africa, VentureSouq, VentureFriends, and angel investors like NerdWallet Co-founders, Tim Chen and Jake Gibson and Belvo Co-founder, Oriol Tintore.\n\nFounded by Nadir Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash is currently testing its product with 17 companies, five of which are active and paying companies. It charges these companies between $150 and $1,000 with transaction fees starting from 10 cents and reducing as payment volume increases.\n\nCurrently operating in Egypt, the company intends to use its pre-seed funding to drive growth across the Middle East and Africa as it aims to become the AWS of payments in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWhat AWS did to the cloud, where it made it easy for companies to build as many services on top of the infrastructure, we think the payment industry, especially in emerging markets, is very fragmented and needs an AWS for money, which MoneyHash is doing when you connect with it and build as much as you need without needing to change anything,\u201d CEO Abdelrazik said in a chat with TechCrunch.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nCrime and NFTs: Chainalysis Detects Significant Wash Trading and Some Money Laundering In this Emerging Asset Class\n\nNigeria\u2019s sleepless students trying to beat the Lagos traffic\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a productive day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "A large delegation made up of notable artistes, musicians, entertainers and creatives from the Northern part of the country paid a courtesy call on the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with commendation for the administration while also tabling their requests to further spur their industry.\n\nThey sang indoors and outdoors at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday evening but the tune and lyrics were the same: President Muhammadu Buhari administration has done well and his deputy, Vice President is the President\u2019s \u2018personal person.\u2019\n\nWhile receiving the delegation, Vice President Osinbajo stated that a country\u2019s most important resource are its human resources, and Nigeria must place a premium on this because its talents are the country\u2019s biggest export and significant investment.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, Prof. Osinbajo said this on Wednesday evening when he received at the Presidential Villa, the Kannywood delegation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey came under the auspices of a group named 13 x 13 Awareness Group led by Kannywood personalities, such as Alhaji Dauda Adamu Rarara, its President and Yakubu Mohammed, spokesperson, among several others.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Kannywood group delivered a special song filled with commendation for the work and accomplishments, while also chorusing that Prof. Osinbajo is together with \u201cBaba Buhari.\u201d The song was led by Yusuf Haruna, a.k.a Baban Chinedu, a Muslim actor who features as an Igbo character in films.\n\nThe lyrics of the song sang in Hausa is translated into English thus:\n\nVerse: \u201cYouths, everyone, come out, from the cities to the rural areas, let\u2019s do Osinbajo and Baba Buhari.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the past, we brought you this song, now we have come with the song again, Osinbajo and Baba Buahri. Buhari is fixing the country for us\u201d\n\nChorus: Osinbajo of Baba Buhari.\n\nThe Kannywood actors praised the leadership, dedication and wisdom of the Buhari-Osinbajo administration.\n\nEmphasising on the need to pay more attention to the country\u2019s human resources, the Vice President noted that Nigeria\u2019s creative sector is one of the most vibrant anywhere, observing that Nigeria\u2019s impressive array of talents across the creative sector needs to be showcased more to the world.\n\nPointing out some of members of the delegation whose works he had encountered such as veteran Kannywood actor, Rabiu Rikadawa, among others, in the room yesterday, the VP said, \u201cI think one of the best things that our country has is talent, very solid talent. Sometimes we make the mistake of not exhibiting our talents enough, not showing off our talents enough and it\u2019s a big mistake because this is our best resource.\u201d\n\nHe stated that some countries do not have any mineral resource, but their best export is their human resource, adding that the creative sector is a very powerful tool of influence in any nation, and can be used effectively to advance social causes and nation building.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the VP \u201cwhen you look at our country, here is a fantastic country, with talents from every corner, but it can also be a place where people are just fighting, quarrelling over nothing; whereas we can bring, with the power of what you are doing, we can bring people together, we can bring all our people together.\n\n\u201cIf you look at sports, if you look at entertainment, they can bring people together. And we must use it to bring our people together, we must use this talent to bring our people together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the film industry. I enjoy comedy, I enjoy songs in whatever language, and I\u2019m sure there are so many who are interested. Even sometimes looking at a video when you don\u2019t even speak the language, you look at a video you\u2019ll laugh because you know that it is funny.\n\n\u201cSo, sometimes it does not matter the language in which it is delivered, people will laugh so long as it is funny. I think that you have a very strong weapon \u2013 the creative industry, has a very strong weapon \u2013 drama, music, comedy, these are very powerful and you can use them to do so many things and we must use it to do so many things.\n\n\u201cThe usefulness of your talent is not just for a small set of people, but it is for everybody because your contributions are very important,\u201d the VP stated.\n\nHe expressed happiness \u201cto see all of us who are here, people who are using their talents to invest as they can.\u201d\n\nThe VP then discussed how the entertainment industry can be supported to do even more. His words: \u201cwe can do more, if we are supported, supported by government, supported by the private sector, but the question is how, how are we going to do that? I want us to take this meeting seriously so that we can have a meeting to advance what we have been talking about.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges of insecurity, insurgency, the Vice President stated that Government would continue to explore ways to support the creative sector and improve other aspects of national life.\n\nHe stated how despite two recessions and the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration has shown firm resolve and commitment towards improving the economy and welfare of all Nigerians.\n\nProf. Osinbajo noted that the Buhari administration will continue to ramp up efforts to improve security across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are still fighting insurgency, Boko Haram insurgency and ISWAP, then we have banditry here and there in the North-West and things like that. All of these have occurrences in the life of a nation. Every nation runs into trouble, but it is the government at the time that must take the responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized on the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari to better the lot of the country, noting that the President is a honest leader.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate that God gave us a leader like President Muhammadu Buhari at the time we are facing. And the reason why I say so is because, you see, if we don\u2019t have a steady hand, matured person who understands a lot of things and who is respected by the people, there will be more chaos and we won\u2019t even know where this will end.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to thank God that at least we have a leader who is considered honest all across the country, everybody knows that he\u2019s a man of his words, no matter where you are in the country, you know that he\u2019s a man of his words, you know he\u2019s honest and you know he is not stealing the resources of the country.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the delegation Alhaji Rarara recalled how some of the delegation members including himself, have been actively supporting the Buhari administration. He also praised the government for many of its laudable programmes that has touched so many people but added that more needed to be done.\n\n\u201cWe know both yourself and the President are committed to the people and are alligned. That is why we are still with you.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks on behalf of the group, Yakubu Mohammed, the spokesperson also added that the group has been supporting the Buhari administration and will continue to support the government. He solicited for government assistance in helping to address some of the challenges the industry is facing especially in the area of financial enablement.\n\nHe said the activities of the group are funded solely by its members, but lamented that their industry is lagging behind. In specific response, the VP said he is looking forward to working with the group to resolve the challenges of the industry.",

          "title": "Subsidy: NNPC Apologises To Nigerians Over Bad Fuel, Long Queues",
          "text": "Nigerians have been apologised to by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited for the importation of off-spec PMS.\n\nThe group managing director of NNPC Ltd, Mele Kyari, who tendered the apology when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Downstream, said the situation was completely unavoidable as the problem was not envisaged.\n\nHe, however, gave assurance that the distribution of petrol would nomalise in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cWe regret this situation. It is completely unavoidable; we didn\u2019t see it coming. We apologise to Nigerians. We didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari disclosed that before the end of the month, about 2.1 billion litres of the product would have been injected into the system.\n\n\u201cI am assuring more supply plan. 2.1bn litres by the end of this month. We have enough supply. We will normalise distribution. We will contain this development,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari, who gave a background to the ongoing scarcity, he blamed the situation of the cargo with the high methanol content.\n\nAccording to him, the withdrawal of the five cargoes created a shortfall in product supply. He however noted that the company had imported a quantity that will close the gap and restore adequate supply.\n\nHe, however, explained that the NNPC Ltd had been in a business agreement with all importers and it was a specific requirement that fuel blended with a high quantity of methanol should not be brought into the country.\n\nEarlier, the chairman of the committee, Abdullahi Mahmoud had told the NNPC to be up and doing in its responsibilities.\n\nHe said what happened had placed Nigerians in a very difficult situation adding that the country and its people are paying the price for a seemingly deliberate failure.\n\nSome members of the community who expressed their anger said despite NNPC\u2019s explanation and measures to tackle the situation, anybody who neglected his responsibilities must be held responsible.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to expose culprits responsible for circulation of toxic fuel, just as it said moves to withdraw N201 billion for cleaning up the poisonous fuel is a ploy to siphon money from the national coffers.\n\nPDP also said the APC-led administration is pushing Nigerians to take to the streets in protest against its continued arrogance, alleged corruption, insensitivity to the feelings of the people as well as alleged shielding of those who imported toxic fuel into the country.\n\nPDP national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said it is saddening that the APC administration has continued to turn deaf ears to the cries by Nigerians, just as he expressed shock that the NNPC Ltd is seeking an estimated N201 billion to clean up the adulterated fuel.\n\nOlogunagba in a statement said, \u201cIt is clear that this is another ploy by officials of the APC administration to continue to pilfer the national treasury to fund APC\u2019s rigging plans ahead of the 2023 elections as well as to finance the wasteful lifestyles of its leaders to the detriment of other Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSuch move by the APC to further fleece the nation amounts to pushing the already exasperated citizens to the wall. The APC government would have nobody but itself to blame over the possible consequences of its continued impunity, insensitivity and disregard to the feelings of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the APC has remained unyielding since our party demanded an investigation into allegations that APC leaders connived with some foreign interests to import very cheap heavily contaminated fuel laden with methanol in their desperation to corruptly raise billions of naira to fund APC\u2019s plots to rig the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall that our party, well-meaning Nigerians and organisations had exposed and challenged APC\u2019s plot to siphon N2.557 trillion padded as fuel subsidy for 2022. Having been so exposed, the APC resorted to fleecing Nigerians through importation of toxic fuel and now seeks to fritter N201 billion under the guise of cleaning up the adulterated fuel.\u201d\n\nPDP added that the failure of the APC administration to set up an independent commission of enquiry on the \u201cAPC Toxic Fuel ImportGate\u201d to ascertain the individuals involved in the deal who undertook the pre-inspection and how much was paid for very cheap contaminated fuel, is fast putting the nation on edge.\n\n\u201cThe only way to douse the tension is for the APC administration to heed to demands by Nigerians and expose APC leaders allegedly involved in the importation of the toxic fuel, get them to pay compensation particularly to those whose vehicles and equipment were damaged by the bad fuel as well as bear the cost of the said cleanup.\u201d\n\nThe PDP however called for the immediate sack of the minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, for misleading Nigerians and concealing critical information at the onset of this saga, having refused and failed as a public official with duty to Nigerians when he said on national TV that he could not name persons involved in the fraud.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also urged President Buhari to hands off responsibilities as minister of petroleum resources and allow competent professionals to man the ministry in order to restore sanity in the system.\n\n\u201cThis is because the headship of the Petroleum Ministry as presently constituted is peopled with persons with no relevant education, experience and expertise to manage this critical sector that accounts for over 90 percent of the revenue of the nation,\u201d the party said\n\nAlso yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the non-oil sector of the Nigerian economy could be stronger, benefitting from its recent growth momentum, higher production from the new Dangote Refinery, and supportive credit policies.\n\nIn its executive board 2021 Article IV consultation with Nigeria which was released recently, IMF said Nigeria\u2019s ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) could also yield a positive boost to the non-oil sector while oil production could rebound, supported by the more generous terms of the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nNigeria exited recession in the fourth quarter of 2020 and its output rose by 4.1 per cent (y-o-y) in the third quarter, with broad-based growth except for the oil sector, which is facing security and technical challenges.\n\nWhile growth was projected at 3 per cent for 2021, it stated that headline inflation rose sharply during the pandemic, reaching a peak of 18.2 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in March 2021, but has since declined to 15.6 per cent in December.\n\nThe institution attributed this to the new harvest season and opening of land borders, although it noted that the reported unemployment rates (end of 2020) had yet to come down. It, however, confirmed that more recent COVID-19 monthly surveys have shown that employment was back at its pre-pandemic level.\n\n\u201cDespite the recovery in oil prices, the general government fiscal deficit is projected to widen in 2021 to 5.9 per cent of GDP, reflecting implicit fuel subsidies and higher security spending,\u201d the Fund said, adding that the consolidated government revenue-to-GDP ratio at 7.5 per cent remains among the lowest in the world.\n\n\u201cAfter registering a historic deficit in 2020, the current account improved in 2021, and gross FX reserves have improved, supported by the IMF\u2019s SDR allocation and Eurobond placements in September 2021.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the authorities\u2019 proactive approach to contain COVID-19 infection rates and fatalities and the recent growth improvement, socio-economic conditions remain a challenge. Levels of food insecurity have risen, and the poverty rate is estimated to have risen during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe directors highlighted the urgency of fiscal consolidation to create policy space and reduce debt sustainability risks and called for significant domestic revenue mobilisation.\n\nThey said Nigeria\u2019s exchange rate reforms should be accompanied by macroeconomic policies to contain inflation, structural reforms to improve transparency and governance, and clear communications regarding exchange rate policy.\n\n\u201cDirectors considered it appropriate to maintain a supportive monetary policy in the near term, with continued vigilance against inflation and balance of payments risks. They encouraged the authorities to stand ready to adjust the monetary stance if inflationary pressures increase,\u201d the consultation noted.\n\n\u201cDirectors recommended strengthening the monetary operational framework over the medium term \u2013 focusing on the primacy of price stability \u2013 and scaling back the central bank\u2019s quasi-fiscal operations. Directors welcomed the resilience of the banking sector and the planned expiration of pandemic-related support measures.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that while the newly launched eNaira could help foster financial inclusion and improve the delivery of social assistance, close monitoring of associated risks will be important,\u201d the IMF added.\n\nMeanwhile, operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Kwara State yesterday arrested scores of fuel black marketers in Ilorin, the state capital.\n\nThey also seized an unspecified number of kegs containing fuel from the black marketers.\n\nThe state\u2019s NSCDC commandant, Iskil Makinde, made the arrest of the black marketers public after an on-the-spot assessment visits to some filling stations in Ilorin.\n\nMakinde said his men discovered that while some filling stations were hoarding fuel, others were selling at N250 per litre.\n\nHe warned that, henceforth, the corps will deal ruthlessly with filling stations hoarding fuel and creating artificial scarcity of the product in the state.\n\n\u201cThe NSCDC task force led by the head of the anti-vandal unit, ACC Ayinde Yusuf discovered that some filling stations had the products but refused to sell while some were selling the product for as high as N250 per litre against the recommended price of N165.\n\n\u201cThose that have the products but chose to hoard it were ordered to start selling, and our teams ensured they emptied their fuel dump before they left the place.\n\n\u201cAlso, some were caught selling above the normal price and were asked to revert to the recommended N165,\u201d Makinde stated.\n\nKaduna residents have continued to face tough times in search of petrol with black marketers selling the commodity for N700/litre.\n\nOur correspondent who went round Kaduna metropolis reported that black marketers with jerry-cans positioned themselves in some locations within the metropolis, selling the commodity to motorists at exorbitant prices.\n\nThe long queues in some fueling stations continued as many stations were under lock and key.\n\nIt was observed further that few fueling stations with the fuel were selling a litre at N220/N230 to motorists.\n\nMeanwhile, transport fares have risen, with drivers lamenting the scarcity of fuel.\n\nOne of the drivers at Command Junction motor park, Television, Ayuba Silas, said: \u201cNow it is N3,000 per passenger from Kaduna to Abuja against N2,500. This fuel scarcity is a serious problem to us commercial drivers. Government should do something urgently.\u201d\n\nResidents of Akure, the Ondo state capital were on Wednesday morning stranded following the fuel scarcity which has made many petrol marketers shut down their stations.\n\nMakesense Promotion\u2019s correspondent who went round the state capital observed that civil servants and others that wanted to catch a bus or taxi to their various offices could not as few commercial vehicles were operating, with most of them queued up at filling stations.\n\nIt was observed that most of the filling stations that opened for business were selling from only one or two pumps, prolonging the misery of motorists.\n\nSome of the vehicles had been at the filling stations as early as 5am as long queues were observed along Ondo Road, Cathedral and Arakale, Oba-Adesida roads among others.\n\nMany major bus stops were filled with passengers begging few private vehicles plying major roads for free rides.\n\nSome residents who spoke to Makesense Promotions lamented the suffering being added to the economic challenge they had been facing before.\n\nThey called on the federal government to address what they described as an unfortunate development before it gets out of hand.\n\nFuel scarcity is gradually biting hard in Damaturu and other parts of Yobe State with the resurfacing of long queues in filling stations where the product is available.\n\nChecks by Makesense Promotions revealed that many petrol stations within the metropolis have remained closed over lack of product.\n\nIn few other stations where it was available, motorists waited endlessly to get fuel.\n\nReports indicate that some petrol stations in other parts of the state sell the product at N200 per litre.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform have zoned the position of the national chairman of the party to the North-central.\n\nThe governor s, who met under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), took the decision ahead of the February 26 APC National Convention.\n\nAlthough divided, the governors also settled for South-south to produce the party\u2019s next national secretary, while agreeing that the deputy national chairman (South) be micro-zoned to South-east.\n\nThe governors reached this agreement Tuesday after a meeting of the forum which did not have some members in attendance.\n\nBlueprint gathered that some PGF members were against the decisions, especially those with presidential and vice presidential ambitions in the North-central region.\n\nAPC had slated February 26, 2022 for its national convention in Abuja, but the issue of zoning has remained a major challenge the needed to contend with to avoid self-implosion.\n\nIt was gathered that the APC governors\u2019 meeting also resolved to send a list of four national chairmanship aspirants from the North-central to President Muhammadu Buhari to show his preference for one of them even as they (governors) wait on the president to fine-tune their proposed zoning arrangement.\n\nA competent source told Blueprint correspondent that the president, currently in Brussels, Belgium, has scheduled a meeting with the governors Saturday (February 19) upon returning from the trip.\n\nThe aspirants\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants from the North-central include; Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa state, Malam Saliu Mustapha from Kwara state, Senator George Akume from Benue state as well as Senator Mohammed Sani Musa and Mohammed Etsu, both from Niger state.\n\nOthers are Senator Abdullahi Adamu from Nasarawa state and former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abu Bawa Bwari from Niger state.\n\nThe top party source confided in Blueprint that apart from the chairmanship position, secretary and that of the deputy national chairman, the governors decided to give Governor Mai Mala Buni Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and other critical stakeholders the leeway to decide on other positions among the remaining zones.\n\n\u201cThough the media was awash with the reports of the inability of the governors to meet with the president before he left for Brussels, in Belgium, the fact was that he (president) left instructions for the Caretaker Committee, the governors and some critical leaders of the party to fine-tune and come up with two names from the earlier list submitted to him.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the party leadership has made appreciable progress and nothing will stop the convention. The president gave specific instructions and the party leadership, in concert with the governors, are working round the clock to ensure a rancour-free convention.\n\n\u201cAnother important assignment given was to resolve the zoning of the National Secretary between South-south and South-east and present a position to him on Saturday when Mr President returns from the African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) Summit.\n\n\u201cAfter a heated discussion, the meeting resolved to zone the office of the National Secretary to South-south while the post of Deputy National Chairman (South) goes to South-east,\u201d the source said.\n\nAspirants write Buhari\n\nIn a related development, some aspirants have written to President Buhari, expressing confidence in the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of an open letter by the estranged Director General of the PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman to the president, Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, the erstwhile PGF boss intimated Buhari of plans to sabotage the scheduled February 26 national convention of APC, referring to Buni\u2019s committee as an \u201cundertaker\u201d, which was not doing enough to show that it was ready to conduct a free, fair and credible exercise.\n\nBut in a swift response Wednesday through another open letter to President Buhari, the aspirants under the aegis of the Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention, alleged that Lukman was engaging in some unholy activities, which also include, \u201cundermining the APC at the behest of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by a leading aspirant for the position of national youth leader, Barr. Maxwell Yakubu Gowon, on behalf of other aspirants; said the Buni-led convention committee had not done anything to warrant the aspirants losing confidence in the process.\n\n\u201cThe Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention writes to intimate Your Excellency on the true state of affairs with the National Convention of our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). We had initially decided against burdening Mr. President with the humdrum of the party\u2019s working in the belief that the APC has enough statements in its fold to resolve ongoing issues while allowing Your Excellency on piloting the affairs of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, the revisionist open letter authored by the immediate past Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, who identified as a \u201cFreelance APC Campaigner.\u201d Without trivializing the present battle for the soul of the APC, it is pertinent to clarify from the onset that Lukman is yet to recover from the disgraceful circumstances of his exit as Director General of PGF and the only straw he can hold on to is to vilify the person and office of the Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), His Excellency Mai Mala Buni and other members of the Committee.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, Lukman is neither an aspirant nor a candidate of our party for the Convention and for any election in the future. In fact, the shady details about his forced exit from his most recent position were about how he was undermining the APC at the behest of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cWe are perplexed that Lukman is today pontificating and creating the impression that he means well for the party. If he truly means well, even as a lowly administrator of PGF, he would have leveraged that position to appeal to his former employers, the APC state governors, to respect party democracy and allow the will of most party members to prevail at the state chapters of the party. Whatever crises the party faces nationally today were birthed at the state levels owing to the overbearing disposition of some state governors. It is therefore perplexing that Lukman who timidly watched the state governors damage the party is now crying murder and attempting to re-write history as we know it and exonerate the state governors.\n\n\u201cWe find it ridiculous that the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), which under the leadership of His Excellency Buni worked tirelessly to resolve some of the crisis in the party, was criminally maligned by Lukman. He accused the Committee of being highhanded and yet expects the same Committee to disregard the views strongly expressed by the party\u2019s stakeholders pertaining to conditions that must be met to have a successful convention.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that the clamour from stakeholders have been majorly about redressing the damages done by the governors at the state chapters, which would make mockery of democracy and our great party if the mistake is made of progressing with the convention without first addressing them. The CECPC refusal to plunge the party further into crisis by succumbing to the whims of the governors, for whom Lukman speaks, is the reason that the Committee and its leadership came under the kind of scathing attack contained in the open letter.\n\n\u201cContrary to the lies that the likes of Lukman have promoted about the current leadership of the party, Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention is pleased to assert that H.E. Buni\u2019s CEPCP is a major reason we still have confidence that the party can still be healed and repositioned in time for it to excel in the 2023 elections. The CEPCP Chairman performed creditably in the way he has handled preparations for the convention by consulting with aspirants before key decisions are taken.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we would have urged Your Excellency, in your capacity as the leader of our great party, to order an investigation of the disgraced former Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman to find out the extent to which he is complicit of the allegation that he is being funded by the opposition PDP to undermine the APC.\n\n\u201cWe came to the realisation that this would be playing into the plot to distract the APC at the highest level, which is not needed at this point. The designation of \u201cFreelance APC Campaigner\u201d he assigned to himself is enough proof that he has already expelled from the party since the concept of freelance campaigner is alien to the party.\n\n\u201cOur prayer, however, is that Mr. President should pass a vote of confidence in His Excellency Mai Mala Buni-CEPCP\u2019s ability to organize the National Convention that will usher in a new dawn for the APC. This expression of confidence in the Committee will re-assure us that we are in a party of rule of law and internal democracy,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Lagos State government has announced that Fourscore Homes Limited, the firm developing the 21-storey building that collapsed on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, on November 1, 2021, will face criminal prosecution.\n\nThis according to a statement made available to Channels Television on Thursday is following the recommendation contained in the White Paper on the incident.\n\nAt least 50 persons were trapped in the building after it collapsed last year. Over 40 were reported killed and nine persons were rescued. The owner of the firm Mr. Femi Osibona also died in the building collapse.\n\nThe state government in the statement also announced that the other two structures being simultaneously constructed in the vicinity are to be demolished because they failed structural integrity tests. They will be pulled down through controlled demolition.\n\nAlso recommended to face administrative disciplinary panel are all government officials involved in granting approval to the developer in 2019.\n\nThe White Paper was prepared by the Lagos State government on the report submitted to it by the panel that probed the building collapse.\n\nTwenty-six out of the 28 recommendations contained in the Report were accepted by the government.\n\nThe report which was submitted on January 5th, by the panel chairman Mr. Toyin Ayinde, who is a town planner, blamed the collapse on the erosion of professional ethics and disregard for due diligence.\n\nThe Lagos State government also added that the panel members during their investigations visited the project site for a general assessment; coordinated activities of the consultants who conducted tests on the site and reviewed documents from relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nThey also conducted interviews; interrogated 91 persons; collected 21 memoranda and accessed the remaining buildings being developed by the late Osibona.\n\nThe tribunal also hosted a representation of the developer\u2019s company comprising two legal firms.\n\nA new committee, which reviewed the tribunal\u2019s 28 recommendations, was chaired by Commissioner for Special Duties Tayo Bamgbose-Martins.\n\nThe Head of Service (HoS), Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Moyosore Onigbanjo, and Agriculture Commissioner Mrs. Abisola Olusanya, served as members of the new committee.\n\nThe accepted 26 recommendations bothered individuals and institutions \u2013 both private and public.\n\nThe review panel rejected two recommendations for being nebulous.\n\nThe government accepted the recommendation that Fourscore Heights Limited, owners of the collapsed building, be prosecuted in view of the loss of lives involved in the tragedy.\n\nThe white paper frowned at a situation in which Fourscore was builder and architect \u2013 all rolled into one. For this, the tribunal concluded that Fourscore Heights did not do the right thing and their negligence led to the loss of lives.\n\nThe state government has since directed the Office of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice to institute appropriate charges against the company.\n\nFor failing structural tests, the two 15-storey buildings have also been approved for demolition through controlled demolition technique, having been recommended for such by the tribunal and accepted to by the state government.\n\nThe White Paper also recommended the \u201cevacuation of all occupants within a 45m radius from the extreme boundaries of the blocks in the interest of public safety.\u201d\n\nThe White Paper states: \u201cThe developer, having been negligent, is to forfeit the project site to the state government, in accordance with section 25(4) of the revised LABSCA regulation 2019.\n\n\u201cAll the various participants, including civil/public servants, found culpable are to face disciplinary actions and prosecution, where applicable.\n\n\u201cThis included all those that were involved in the 2019 approval of the collapsed building. The civil servants are to first face the personnel management board, in line with the public service rules. The disciplinary process is to be set up immediately and concluded within 14 days.\n\n\u201cApart from civil servants, some professionals have also been referred to the professional bodies for disciplinary actions. The list here included engineers, town planners, and architects; while some companies have also been referred to the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria for disciplinary actions for their roles in the collapsed building.

The three civil servants are to be prosecuted for preparing a consultant\u2019s report through a dubious method.\n\nHowever, one Oluwole Oludimu of Prowess Engineering Limited was highly commended for exhibiting the highest professionalism in challenging circumstances and standing firm despite intimidation by the developer and subsequent removal from the site by his firm.\n\nThe government also accepted the recommendation that an audit exercise by an independent consortium of professionals to scrutinise all high-rise buildings in the state.\n\nAlso accepted was the recommendation that there should be training for all officials involved in the building approval section, with more hands recruited to assist agencies that are short-staffed.",

          "text": "France and its allies in a European force announced Thursday they would begin withdrawing troops from Mali after nearly 10 years fighting a jihadist insurgency.\n\nA statement signed by France and its African and European allies said that \u201cmultiple obstructions\u201d by the ruling junta meant that the conditions were no longer in place to operate in Mali.\n\nThe decision applies to both France\u2019s Barkhane force in the Sahel and the Takuba European force that Paris had been trying to forge along with its allies.\n\n\u201cThe political, operational, and legal conditions are no longer met to effectively continue their current military engagement in the fight against terrorism in Mali,\u201d the statement said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Mali Stands Firm Against Economic Sanctions\n\nThe allies, therefore \u201cdecided to commence the coordinated withdrawal of their respective military resources dedicated to these operations from Malian territory.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was made as President Emmanuel Macron is to travel to Brussels on Thursday for a two-day EU-Africa summit, following an 0800 GMT press conference at the Elysee on the \u201cengagement of France in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nThe Mali deployment has been fraught with problems for France. Of the 53 soldiers killed serving in its Barkhane mission in West Africa, 48 of them died in Mali.\n\nFrance initially deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 but the insurgency was never fully quelled, and now new fears have emerged of a jihadist push to the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nEven after the pull-out from Mali, however, the allies vowed to remain engaged in fighting terror in other countries including Niger.\n\n\u201cThey agreed nonetheless to continue their joint action against terrorism in the Sahel region, including in Niger and in the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThey have begun political and military consultations with them with the aim to set out the terms for this shared action by June 2022.\u201d\n\nCritical moment\n\nThe announcement of the withdrawal came at a critical time for Macron, just days ahead of a long-awaited declaration from the president that he will stand for a new term in the April elections.\n\nIt also coincided with Macron seeking to take a lead role in international diplomacy as he presses Russia to de-escalate in the standoff over Ukraine.\n\nEspecially with the French elections looming, Macron\u2019s priority is to ensure that any withdrawal does not invite comparisons with the chaotic US departure from Afghanistan last year.\n\nMacron on Wednesday prepared the ground for the announcement with a dinner bringing together the leaders of France\u2019s key allies in the Sahel region \u2014 Chad, Mauritania, and Niger.\n\nOfficials from Mali and Burkina Faso, which also recently experienced a coup, were not invited to the meeting.\n\nThere are a total of 25,000 foreign troops currently deployed in the Sahel region.\n\nThey include around 4,300 French soldiers, which under a reduction announced last year are due to fall to around 2,500 in 2023 from a peak of 5,400.\n\nOther forces deployed in Mali are the UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA established in 2013 and the EUTM Mali, an EU military training mission that aims to improve the Malian military\u2019s capacity in fighting terrorists.\n\nSome 2,400 French soldiers are deployed in Mali as part of the Barkhane operation as well as the EU Takuba force set up in 2020, which was intended to increase in numbers as French deployment was scaled back.\n\n\u2018A void\u2019\n\nAccording to a French source, who asked not to be identified by name, even after the departure France will for a period provide MINUSMA and EUTM with air support and medical back-up.\n\nBut Paris\u2019 withdrawal could set the stage for other European powers like Britain or Germany to abandon their roles in the multinational missions.\n\n\u201cThe departure of Barkhane and Takuba creates a void,\u201d Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara said Wednesday.\n\nIn the Sahel and Gulf of Guinea, \u201cnational armies will have to deal with problems on our national territories, and that\u2019s our philosophy\u201d, he told broadcasters RFI and France 24.\n\nRelations between France and Mali have plunged to new lows after the junta led by strongman Assimi Goita refused to stick to a calendar to a return to civilian rule.\n\nThe West also accuses Mali of using the services of the hugely controversial Russian mercenary group Wagner to shore up its position, a move that gives Moscow a new foothold in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is an inglorious end to an armed intervention that began in euphoria and which ends, nine years later, against a backdrop of crisis between Mali and France,\u201d commented the Le Monde daily.\n\nAFP",

According to him, the development was not intentional.\n\n\u201cNo one out there will bring this product into this country deliberately,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way we would have seen this methanol except your supplier decides to disclose to you because it is not part of their requirements to look for this.\u201d\n\nLast week, the NNPC said the long queues were due to the importation of adulterated fuel into the country. The situation led to long queues in major cities as many struggled to get the product. Hoodlums have also reportedly taken advantage of the situation as millions of Nigerians queue for hours, staying late into the night to get fuel.\n\nIn Kaduna, residents, who lamented the situation, said they have resorted to patronising black marketers who sell the product for as much as N1, 000 per litre.\n\n\u201cI spent more than five hours following the line,\u201d one of the residents, Abdulsalam Munir, told Channels Television.\n\n\u201cSince when I came, I haven\u2019t gotten fuel and my car was on the line. Up till now (in the afternoon), I haven\u2019t bought fuel. Even when you go to the black market, we buy one litre for N1, 000. So, fuel is very scarce and we are calling on the government to put an end to this thing.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the scarcity, the NNPC ordered its retail outlets to operate a 24-hour schedule to ameliorate the plight of Nigerians.",

But using the mobile units, the first doses will be ready after 12 months, Sahin said.\n\nThe containers could also be used to produce vaccines against malaria based on mRNA technology, were it to be authorised after clinical trials planned to begin this year.\n\nBioNTech employees will operate the containers to begin with, while training local employees \u201cto hand over the site in the mid- or long-term\u201d, according to the statement.\n\nThe vaccine technology will be shared without the patents behind it being waived, as requested by a number of countries and NGOs.\n\n\u201cPatents aren\u2019t the key.

          "text": "More details have emerged on how suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari earned the undying loyalty of operatives of the elite police group, the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), a relationship he was said to have built way back.\n\nIt has been revealed that despite his suspension, Kyari still had his hold on the operatives and called the shots under the table through his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, who was also seconded to Disu.\n\nThe IRT, an elite unit set up by then Inspector General of Police, was to tackle high profile crimes like kidnapping and even terrorism.\n\nHeaded then by Kyari, the team soon made its mark as a squad that was out to tackle crime given the constant arrests and the category of cases they busted.\n\nBut Kyari did not come upon such a team by happenstance; he had groomed them from Lagos, when he was the commander in charge-of-the-state (Special Anti Robbery Squad SARS), although now disbanded.\n\nWhile at SARS, the team forged stronger through cracking cases but were at different times accused of extra judicial killings and other allegations of fraud and obtaining money from families of suspects to release them.\n\nThe case that brought him to national limelight was that of Evans Onwuamadike, the \u2018Billionaire kidnapper\u2019, who was arrested by Kyari and his team.\n\nAlthough the ground work that led to his arrest was done by DCP Tunji Disu, who was at that time the Commander of the Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) with support from then Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, Kyari and men took the glory and promotions that came with it.\n\nBut the high profile arrest was tainted by how Kyari\u2019s men allegedly re-looted the loot Evans obtained from his victims, forcefully.\n\nDuring the raid, the operatives were alleged to have packed both local and foreign currencies, exotic phones, designer wristwatches, jewelry, television and even glass cups.\n\nIn a petition by Evans through his lawyers, he accused Kyari and men of forcibly taking N50 million from him and N5million from his wife under the pretext that he would be released on bail.\n\nEvans also deposed in the affidavit that he was dispossessed of $10,000 by the same police officers.\n\nFor each operation, the bond between Kyari and men forged stronger as they weathered one allegation after the other.\n\nIt was part of measures by the police hierarchy to cut the seeming excesses of the group that IRT alongside the STS, was integrated into the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) headed by Ibrahim Lamorde.\n\nIn spite of that move, the team was still dogged with countless petitions and allegations of human rights abuse and corruption. Yet, there was seemingly nothing much the authorities could do because of the godfathers said to be behind Kyari.\n\nBut following his suspension by the PSC on the recommendation of the present IGP, Baba, over the Hushpuppi case, it seemed he was finally caged.\n\nUnbeknownst to the police hierarchy, he was still calling the shots at the IRT despite the capable hands of DCP Tunji Disu, who was detailed by the IG to take over the unit.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that Kyari was still carrying out discreet illegal operations through his then deputy, who was as well seconded to Disu, when he assumed office.\n\nA senior officer, who spoke on anonymity to THISDAY from the force headquarters said when Ubua was questioned by the IG, he said he was forced to obey orders from Kyari, because the suspended DCP assured him he would soon be reinstated by the force.\n\nBut when the NDLEA authorities briefed the IG on the case against Kyari and his men, they were all invited for questioning and Disu said he handed over to his deputy, because he had an operation to carry out in Sokoto.\n\nThis much was confirmed by the deputy, who said he carried out the operation without informing the head of the unit on the request of Kyari.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe force is at a terrible spot at the moment. How did DCP Kyari think for a moment that he would be reinstated after the FBI fiasco? Who was giving him such assurance? It was a stunned IG, who heard that he kept assuring his boys that DCP Disu would be removed and he would be reinstated.\n\n\u201cThat, however, does not exonerate ACP Ubua, who should know better than to place loyalty to man over the police force he pledged to serve. The only good thing that came out from this was that the IG finally signed the appeal by DCP Disu to allow him raise his own team and not use those inherited from his predecessor.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY carried out subsequent checks on what gave Kyari such hopes that he would be cleared as usual and reinstated despite the damning allegations by FBI.\n\nAnother source in the know said Kyari was parroting that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was behind his woes.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen the Hushpuppi incident happened, he reassured us that it would soon fizzle out and he would be reinstated. According to him, his woes were orchestrated by IPOB given that he had arrested some of them in different operations.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the FBI lawyer had Igbo affiliations and was probably sympathetic to the Biafra cause. So, we shouldn\u2019t worry, because his godfathers were on top of the case to get him reinstated.\u201d\n\nBut contrary to allegations that the police authorities had scrapped IRT and STS, the IG has set plans in motion to sanitise the units by posting fresh officers that would be ready to take instructions from their commander.\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The forthcoming convention of Nigeria\u2019s All Progressive Congress (APC) has split governors elected under the political party into three different groups.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while the group of second term governors want the convention to hold as planned and are assiduously working towards settling for a candidate; the second group which is made up of mainly first term governors want the convention either postponed and a mechanism to return the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee designed so that Buni can continue. On the other hand, a third group of governors also want the convention to hold, and for Buni to continue or the convention postponed.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt that President Muhammadu Buhari met with Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. Kayode Fayemi before he travelled on the matter, and the decision they both arrived is yet to be disclosed.\n\nNevertheless, due to the development, there is palpable tension, apprehension, and misgivings in the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) over the choice of a consensus national chairman for the APC as there were also indications last night that the leadership of the party had begun to consider March for a possible new date for its national convention, earlier slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nBut one of the frontrunners for the chairmanship position, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, told THISDAY on Wednesday that February 26 remained \u201csacrosanct\u201d. Mustapha said with the kind of energy the caretaker committee was devoting to preparations for the convention he believed they knew what to do.\n\nMustapha told THISDAY, \u201cI don\u2019t want to dispute or argue over speculation, since they have not come out officially to say it will hold or it will not hold. For now, we will still retain earlier information that February 26 is sacrosanct. So, if anything is contrary to that, we will have to wait for the official channel of the party to report it to all of us.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, the interim national leadership of the party was forced to fix February 26 for the convention, after pressure from the APC governors and other aggrieved stakeholders, who had expressed their displeasures over foot-dragging on the matter.\n\nA crucial meeting between Buhari and the APC governors to fine-tune the zoning of offices and other matters during the convention could not hold on Tuesday as the president met with only Fayemi on behalf of the governors.\n\nThe meeting with the APC governors to fine-tune zoning, was to enable the president disclose his preferred chairmanship aspirant to the governors and pave the way for the zoning of other National Working Committee (NWC) offices.\n\nExplaining why the meeting did not hold as scheduled, a source in the presidency told THISDAY yesterday in Abuja that Buhari told some governors, who met with him individually that there was nothing on ground to suggest that the Buni committee was preparing for the national convention.\n\nThe president, who left for Brussels to attend an African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) summit, had met with some of the governors, who had arrived at the villa early for the botched meeting.\n\nThe governors included Ben Ayade (Cross River), Hope Uzodimma (Imo), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Simeon Lalong (Plateau), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nThe inside source stated, \u201cWe are now looking at March for possible date for the national convention. Like the president said, there is nothing on ground to convince us that the caretaker committee is ready for the convention on February 26.\n\n\u201cFirst, the committee has not been able to come out with a zoning formula for the various positions in the party. And we cannot go into the convention without all these things well-spelt out.\u201d\n\nBoth Uzodimma and Ayade also hinted on Tuesday that the convention date was not sacrosanct.\n\nThe insider explained further that the Buni committee might have deliberately been pussyfooting around the convention because they had all long planned to hold the national convention and the presidential primaries the same day.\n\nA presidency source stated, \u201cThe committee wants to also be the one to conduct the presidential primary, but conducting the national convention on February 26 means that there will be a new national executive committee in place to conduct the presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the agenda of Mai Mala Buni-led committee. As I speak with you, the APC governors and other entrenched interest groups within the party are divided on the matter\n\n\u201cSome governors, who met with the president on Tuesday, asked him who was his preferred chairmanship candidate. But, as usual, the president refused to disclose his interest. He only requested for the list of the 12 aspirants. And their names have been forwarded to the relevant security agencies for scrutiny.\n\n\u201cHowever, the near consensus is that the national chairman of the party should go to the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nBut speaking with THISDAY, Mustapha said he did not want to dispute or speculate on a new date for the convention, since the party had not come out with an official statement on the issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you notice, the trend in the APC, even when the governors met the other time, is that none of them has the authority to pronounce certain things unless endorsed by the authorised organ, and that was why Governor Mai Mala Buni was the one that spoke and gave a specific date for the convention. He is the chairman of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cSo, I will want to restrict myself to waiting for the official right channel to instruct or to indicate where we stand. As at today, I want to believe the convention is going to take place on February 26.\u201d\n\nAsked to rate his chances in the race, the APC national chairmanship hopeful said, \u201cI believe my chances are very bright and the sky is the limit for me. It has been very positive. Among 11 or 12 of us, we do not see it as a do-or-die affair. We have always approached each other as brothers in this game.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I just came across two of my fellow contestants now and the way we were laughing, hugging, playing, was amazing. For us, it is a family affair that can easily be resolved, because for us, we know what it is to have gotten to this point in our journey, and we would try to see that all hands are on deck so as to come out victorious and be able to continue from the gains already recorded by the present administration ably led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nMeanwhike, ahead of the planned convention, there appears to tension and cracks in different camps of the PGF over the choice of a consensus national chairman.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the cracks followed a meeting between the governors of Kebbi State and Jigawa State, Atiku Bagudu and Mohammed Badaru, respectively, who were said to have secretly presented their choice of a consensus national chairman to Buhari, without the knowledge of the other governors.\n\nIt was learnt that the two governors met with the president last week, where they sold the idea of Senator Sani Musa as a consensus national chairman of the APC. But other APC governors on hearing of the meeting rejected the choice of Musa, and insisted it was not made with their consent.\n\nBuhari was said to have clearly told Bagudu and Badaru that due process should be followed in picking the consensus chairman. The president, it was gathered, further told them to meet with Buni and other members to agree on the options that met his criteria.\n\nBut the crisis rocking APC, insiders said, was compounded by the inability of the convention committee to announce a zoning formula for the national convention.\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "title": "Again, NNPC Apologises to Nigerians, Reveals Five Vessels of Substandard Fuel Rejected",
          "text": "Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, on Wednesday apologised to Nigerians for damages caused by the importation of substandard fuel into the country. Kyari assured Nigerians that normalcy would return to petrol stations by next week, saying the national oil company has taken necessary steps to restore supply in the country.\n\nKyari spoke this in Abuja while addressing the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, during an investigative hearing on the importation of methanol-blended petrol.\n\nHowever, in a bid to end the fuel scarcity and clear the long queues at filling station in many parts of the country, petroleum products marketing companies, under the umbrella of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), have extended their opening hours in their jetties, depots and filling stations to a minimum of 18 hours.\n\nKyari said with at least 2.1 billion litres of petrol in stock, the fuel queues would end by next week.\n\nThe NNPC boss disclosed that given the current situation, five other vessels conveying their next supply had been rejected and were not allowed to sail into the country\u2019s waters because they were coming from the same shipping terminal that sent the four substandard cargos. He stressed that the current challenge was because Nigeria imported all gasoline.\n\nKyari said, \u201cNot a single litre of petrol is generated in the country, that means 100 per cent of petrol you see in this country is imported. Those imports are done on the basis of existing contractual arrangements that we have. It is called the direct sale- direct purchase process, which is simply with the best of practice to enable our suppliers supply products to us on agreed terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing this since I came on board and its part of our supply mechanism. Even if all our refineries come up today, except Dangote Refinery, we will still be in short supply of premium motor spirit (PMS), because all of our refineries can only make 18 million litres of gasoline. Consumption is certainly above 18million litres.\u201d\n\nKyari further explained that the four cargoes that in question met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and convey into ship.\n\nWhile noting that there was no way, based on the current specifications, that they would know that the PMS contained methanol, as it was not part of their requirements at the load port, Kyari assured that they have been able to trace all the volumes and quarantine them accordingly.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy law, NNPC is required to ensure energy security. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide energy security for this country. This company must operate within the laws of this country and this is what we have always done, and this is what we will continue to do.\n\n\u201cFor this current situation, I assure you that we have taken every necessary step to restore supply into this country. We have placed orders significant enough for us to cross into March, with at least 2.1 billion litres of PMS in our custody. The situation you are seeing today I can assure you that by next week, it will vanish.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, because of distribution issues that we may not have control over, including the movement of trucks, otherwise, we have robust supply arrangement to make sure that we exit this issue.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of those contracts, our suppliers bring products to us and we reconcile with them regularly. Part of those supply arrangements is to give specification to your suppliers. These specifications are bound by regulation and the latest that we are using is the one that is in place since 2006.\n\n\u201cThe current specifications we have is what is the subject of all our import arrangement. So all our partners were given those specifications and on the basis of this, those imports were made. Before a vessel leaves the load port, they have to declare that those vessels meet our specification; they will send it to the importer and confirm that it is the specification. On the basis of that, you allow the sail away of the vessel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cNow, once it comes to the country, two things happen. We have NNPC surveyors, who are now also required to validate that this product that we have meets the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cAlso we have the regulatory authority who has to conduct an independent assessment to confirm that this product meets the specification that is in consonance with the existing regulation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn case of all the problems we have seen, four of the cargoes that are particularly in question today met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and conveyed into ship.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way, based on the current specification, that you will know these PMS contains methanol. It is not part of their requirements at the load port. So we did not ask them to declare whether it contains methanol because it is not part of our specification.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that methanol is not contamination, it is a regular addictive to PMS. In China, up to 15 per cent PMS contain methanol. On its own it is not a contamination, the key issue is handling methanol. If we knew we will not accept this. Anytime methanol comes in contact with water it emulsifies, it turns into a different chemical.\u201d\n\nKyari lamented that one of the challenges NNPC faced was lack of tracking mechanism to track trucks leaving the depot. He said this had aided smuggling, as some of the fuel was transported to places that might not be in this country.\n\nThe GMD disclosed that NNPC had filed litigation against importers of the methanol-blended PMS considering the effect of the withdrawing the products across the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat did we do? We have put all our suppliers who are our contacts or commercial angle on notice that there would be liquidated damages that will come from this. And also it is typical practice that we compile liquidated damages that the direct supplier did not cost, he will transfer that to the next person until it gets to the originating supplier, so it is a back-to-back arrangement.\n\n\u201cThat is always done so that once you file, it will get to the last one. I do not know how many people are in the chain because this PMS supply business in one cargo you can have three sellers, you can have two, and you may have only one.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House committee, Hon. Adediji Olamide, in his submission, said ignorance was not an excuse in law. Olamide said the committee would need a lot of documentation that NNPC.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, noted that the investigative hearing was to ensure that the culprits were brought to book as well as make recommendations towards curbing a reoccurrence of the incident.\n\nHe stated that the task ahead was challenging, including examining the lessons, proffering solutions and way forward, and rejigging supply and regulating the system to make them more effective and efficient.\n\nOil Marketers Move to Clear Fuel Queues, Extend Opening Period to 24 hours\n\nMeanwhile, MOMAN said where possible, its members would extend their opening hours up to 24 hours a day in high density and flagship locations where the security situation permitted. The association stated that its members \u201cshall operate these extended hours until the excessive queues subside.\u201d\n\nThe association made this known yesterday in a statement signed by its Chairman and Managing Director of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun. The statement added that it was working with the regulatory authorities and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards a resolution of the current fuel crisis.\n\nAdeosun said MOMAN\u2019s subject matter experts were active contributors to the technical and commercial committees\u2019 set up by the regulatory authorities to re-stock fuel supplies, resolve the blending of contaminated product and identify losses suffered by customers, operators and third parties.\n\nHe said MOMAN members were also working with designated laboratories to double-check the quality of product (re-blended or new) before they are released into the fuels supply chain.\n\nMost importantly, Adeosun maintained that MOMAN members had committed resources towards enhanced operations and associated activities to reduce the burden of the current fuel scarcity to customers.\n\nThe association urged its customers not to engage in panic buying, as it might take a few days for normalcy to return, stressing that panic buying increases the pressure on the supply chain.\n\n,The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned an alleged attempt by some unscrupulous elements to hijack the adulterated fuel saga and resultant fuel scarcity to engage in a protest aimed to instigate crisis in the country and damage the reputation of the NNPC Limited.\n\nNANS also bemoaned the serious fuel supply disruption across the country occasioned by the importation of bad petrol, allegedly, by some approved dealers of the NNPC.\n\nThe students\u2019 body, in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its National President, Asefon Sunday, and Secretary General, Adekitan Lukman, said it was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain individuals had mobilised civil society organisations (CSOs) to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nWhile acknowledging the avoidable situation the country had been plunged into as a result of the fuel supply disruption, NANS frowned on those it claimed wanted to make political gain out of a purely operational issue, urging them to have a rethink.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWhile we acknowledge the avoidable situation we are in as a country after almost six years of no queues and scarcity, we frown on those who want to make political gain out of a purely operational issue and urge those behind the attempt to put a spanner in the smooth administrative structure of President Muhammadu Buhari at the NNPC to desist forthwith.\n\nNANS was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain enemies of the Kyari leadership wanted to use the petrol scarcity as a excuse to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nThe association demanded a speedy resolution of all issues and the normalisation of fuel supply across the country to ameliorate the hardship being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nNANS, however, commended the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari for an inquiry into the dire fuel importation mishap, which has put a strain on the supply chain and on Nigerians, saying it hoped the inquiry would be decisive and far-reaching.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",

          "text": "Several Sydney beaches, including the iconic Bondi and Bronte, were shut down on Thursday after a swimmer was killed in a shark attack, the first such fatality at the city\u2019s beaches in nearly 60 years.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nDrum lines, which are used to bait sharks, have been set up near the attack site while drones have been deployed as officials search for if the shark is still in the area.\n\nA video shared online showed a shark attacking a person on Wednesday afternoon off Little Bay beach, about 20 km (12 miles) south of Australia\u2019s largest city and near the entrance to Botany Bay. Police have not yet disclosed the identity of the swimmer.\n\n\u201cThis has been a complete shock for our community,\u201d Dylan Parker, the mayor of Randwick Council which includes Little Bay, told Reuters. \u201cOur coastline is our backyard and to have a tragic death under such horrifying circumstances is completely shocking.\u201d\n\nA charity ocean swim at a nearby beach scheduled for Sunday was cancelled out of respect for the victim and family. Organisers of the Murray Rose Malabar Magic Ocean Swim had considered postponing the swim till March, but said they decided to cancel it after consulting with the local council and lifesavers.\n\nA spokesperson for the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries said its shark biologists believe that a white shark at least 3 metres (9.8 feet) in length was likely responsible for the attack. It was the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 1963, data showed.\n\nAuthorities have ordered people to remain out of the water on a hot summer day as temperatures hovered around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\u201cA few crazy surfers still go out and take the risk but most of us take notice and just stay out of the water until the sharks have gone. It\u2019s a lot more dangerous driving, to be quite honest,\u201d local resident Karen Romalis told Reuters.",

          "title": "Valieva to Take to Olympic Ice Once More on Thursday Amid Doping Scandal",
          "text": "Kamila Valieva aims for the top step of a podium she may never see when the Russian figure skating star, now at the center of the latest Olympic doping scandal, concludes her competition Thursday night with the women\u2019s free skate at the Beijing Games.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee already has said there will be no flower ceremony if Valieva places among the top three finishers, creating an awkward feeling of open-endedness when the event wraps up. There also will be no medal ceremony for the figure skaters because the IOC fears that Valieva someday could be stripped of hers.\n\n\u201cThere will be an asterisk against the results, because they will be preliminary obviously pending the investigation,\u201d IOC spokesman Mark Adams said. \u201cWould we prefer not to have all this going on? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nThe 15-year-old Valieva tested positive for a banned heart medication at the Russian championships in December. But the result wasn\u2019t announced until last week, shortly after she had helped win a team gold medal that is now also in doubt.\n\nShe was cleared to compete earlier this week by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled among other things that she had protected status as a minor and would suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if she was not allowed to perform. But the court did not rule on the full scope of the case, leaving that to a more comprehensive investigation later.\n\n\u201cDo I feel sorry for her? I don\u2019t think so. I wouldn\u2019t say so,\u201d said Kaori Sakamoto of Japan, who is in third place after her short program. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on the competition. At the moment, I\u2019m actually trying not to think about things like that. Of course, there were moments where I thought: \u2018What\u2019s going to happen? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nValieva has claimed the drug triggering her positive, trimetazidine, entered her system by accident. But the World Anti-Doping Agency filed a brief stating two other substances she acknowledged taking, L-carnitine and Hypoxen \u2014 though both legal \u2014 undercut the argument that a banned substance could have been ingested in error.\n\nHypoxen is used to increase blood flow to the heart, and L-carnitine is an oxygen-boosting performance enhancer that is banned if injected above certain thresholds. When those substances are combined with trimetazidine, U.S. Anti-Doping CEO Travis Tygart said, it\u2019s \u201can indication that something more serious is going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou use all of that to increase performance,\u201d Tygart said. \u201cIt totally undermines the credibility\u201d of Valieva\u2019s defense.\n\nIn the meantime, IOC President Thomas Bach offered Olympic torches to the U.S. figure skaters who won team silver medals as a holdover gift while they await the resolution of the doping case, The Associated Press learned late Wednesday.\n\nOfficials from the IOC have not responded to requests for comment on Bach\u2019s meeting with the team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely disappointing,\u201d said Karen Chen, who competed in the team event and enters Thursday night in 13th place after her short program. \u201cI really was looking forward to being on the podium with my teammates, and just sharing that moment, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one that felt that way. So definitely, definitely disappointing.\u201d\n\nWhile the doping case continues to unfold around her, Valieva has tried to go about her business as usual, taking part in every practice session on her schedule. And though she looked calm and collected during a run-through for her short program, the tension appeared to finally get to her when skated off the ice and broke down in tears.\n\nEven though her performance, which included a shaky triple axel, left her in first place by nearly two points.\n\nValieva refused to speak to reporters after the short program, though she would be required to attend a news conference if she finishes in the top three Thursday night. In her only public comments so far, Valieva told Russian state broadcaster Channel One on Monday night that \u201cthese days have been very difficult for me. I\u2019m happy but I\u2019m tired emotionally.\u201d\n\nValieva plans to go big in her free skate, set to \u201cBolero\u201d by the early 20th century French composer Maurice Ravel. The leader of the Russian team\u2019s \u201cQuad Squad\u201d is attempting three of the four-revolution jumps: a quad salchow on her opening jumping pass, a quad toe loop-triple toe loop combination and a quad toe loop-triple salchow combo.\n\nValieva\u2019s program has the highest base value \u2014 by far \u2014 of anyone in the field, which means she would have to miss several of the jumps and have an uncharacteristically poor performance to land anywhere but first place.\n\nHer closest pursuer, teammate and world champ Anna Shcherbakova, is planning to open with a quad flip, while Alexandra Trusova has planned an ambitious five quads in her free skate as she tries to leapfrog third-place Sakamoto and give the Russians the first sweep of the women\u2019s figure skating event in Olympic history.\n\n\u201cIf I skate clean, there is a chance I will get Olympic gold,\u201d Trusova said. \u201cIf not, then not. My goal is to skate clean",
