Zubairu Dada said the signing of the MoU was a consolidation of discussions held at different levels by ECOWAS leaders to find ways of containing threats to security in the sub-region.\n\nAlso in his remarks, the president of ECOWAS Commission Brou said the signing of the MoU reiterated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to promoting peace and security in West Africa.\n\nHe said that the regional early warning mechanism was set up by the ECOWAS 1999 protocol for conflict prevention, management, resolution, peacekeeping and security.\n\nHe said that it was also to support the region in anticipating, mitigating and responding to challenges of human security.\n\n\u201cIn order to support member states in strengthening their capacity in preventing human security challenges, the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government in 2014 signed a supplementary Act.\n\n\u201cAdopting the policy framework on the establishment of national early warnings, and rapid response mechanism,\u201d he said.\n\nBrou commended the vice president\u2019s leadership and support and appealed to Nigeria to sign an Executive Order to give legal backing to the planned National Centre for Early Warning and Response System.\n\nThe statement said senior government officials present at the ceremony included the Ministers of Defence, Maj.- Gen. Bashir Magashi (retired), Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajia Zainab Ahmed.\n\nOthers were the Ministers of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Farouq, Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen and National Security Adviser, Maj.- Gen.

          "text": "Professor Is-haq Oloyede\n\nBy Shina Abubakar, Osogbo\n\nThe Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, Professor Is-haq Oloyede has disclosed that the hue over the poor performance of students in the last Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination is not only exaggerated but also misplaced.\n\nHe added that though UTME is not an achievement test but a ranking test aimed at grading a group of candidates for equitable placement into tertiary institutions, yet, government and stakeholders should interrogate the facilities available for candidates preparing to enter higher institutions of learning in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the foundation laying ceremony of JAMB\u2019s The International Talent Resort Centre, Alarape, Gbongan, Osun state on Wednesday, he said the body has substantially won the war against examination malpractices, saying no amount of blackmail would deter the body from ridding the education system of the illicit act of examination syndicates.\n\nHe also counseled tertiary institutions to pay attention to the activities of examination fraudsters parading themselves tutorial masters in charge of IJMB and JUPEB units destroying the education system.\n\nALSO READ: Gunmen abduct traditional ruler in Kogi\n\n\u201d The future of our country depends on how far we can go to improve on the standard of education. The recent uproar on the exaggerated poor performance of candidates who sat for the 2021 UTME is misplaced. Nevertheless, the 2021 UTME result offers the opportunity to all of us to interrogate the quality of preparation of and facilities for candidates into the tertiary education system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMany may not have noticed that shortly before the commencement of 2021 UTME, a cartel published a fake digital past UTME Question Papers and was circulating fake questions and answers claiming to be genuinely from JAMB. Many parents who fell for the scam must have now realised how wrong they and their not so innocent children were.\n\nThis explains why many students had to collapse in the examination hall when reality stared them in the face. This is a lesson for people to realize that the days of examination malpractice in JAMB conducted examinations is over and over forever.\n\n\u201cIt is high time, the Governments, particularly the state governments paid sufficient attention to combating the highly organized gang of examination fraudsters who in almost every city of the nation operate under the guise of tutorial classes in largely uncompleted dilapidated buildings with unqualified tutors and proprietors whose expertise is forging A/level qualifications and corrupting the education system.\n\n\u201cA recent experiment by Bayero University, Kano shows that as high as 96% of the A/level results being churned out (courtesy of these tutorial centers) are fake. The states and security agencies, therefore, need to pay sufficient attention to the fast-expanding illicit education gangsters.\n\n\u201cTertiary institutions also need to \u2013 pay particular attention to the fact that these examination fraudsters parading themselves as tutorial masters are infiltrating vastly and deeply into the institutions- IJMB and JUPEB units -wreaking untold havoc on the education system.\n\nALSO READ: Buhari swears in 5 Permanent Secretaries\n\nSpeaking on the talent resort centre, Oloyede said the edifice first phase project comprises of an office and a 550 seater CBT centre, saying, \u201cthis International Talent Resort is programmed to be an integrated ultra-modern educational facility to serve all researchers, particularly those engaged in various academic services of the Board\u201d.\n\nSpeaking, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who was represented by the Secretary to the state government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji remarked that the center is another feather added to the many garlands that have rightfully characterized the Oloyede leadership in JAMB.\n\nHe assured JAMB of enabling an atmosphere defined by unrivaled tranquility that can facilitate serious intellectual and relaxation adventure adding that is one of the states that enjoy electricity supply the most in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Olufi of Gbongan, Oba (Dr) Adetoyese Oyeniyi expressed gratitude to JAMB authorities and assured the body of the support of his subjects.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

INEC, ended up exposing a poor knowledge of the application of the law, by stating that the judgment cannot apply in a case of defection of a governor from the party on which platform he was elected to another, particularly, a party that did not even participate in the election.\n\n\u201cWe refer Keyamo to the definite pronouncement of the Supreme Court in that case, to the effect that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party acts only as the \u201cagent\u201d of his party.\n\n\u201cThe incontrovertible applicative import of that judgment is that the votes upon which Bello Matallawe assumed office as the governor of Zamfara state belong to the PDP and they are not transferable to the APC, which did not sponsor candidates for that election as required by section 221 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cOn Keyamo\u2019s claim that once elected, the governor drops that party ticket and becomes free even to decamp to any other political party, we ask if that be the case under the law, how come Mukhtar Shehu Idris of the APC, who was already declared as elected governor of Zamfara State, had to lose the position immediately the Supreme Court decided that the votes cast for APC in that election cannot count?\n\nALSO READ: BREAKING: More suspects arrested over Super TV CEO\u2019s murder\n\n\u201cNigeria runs a party system and the judgement of the Supreme Court had made it clear that a state governor only stands on the pedestal of votes belonging to the political party which sponsored him at the election and that, once the pedestal is removed, as in the case of Mukhtar Shehu Idris in Zamfara, or once the governor jumps off the pedestal, as in the case of Bello Matawalle, he automatically loses statutory understructure to remain a governor.\n\n\u201cPerhaps Kayamo needs be reminded that there is no position of independent candidacy in Nigeria which is why it is the logos of political parties and not names of candidates that are imprinted on the ballot papers if he had ever participated in elections and voted before.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, therefore, finds it strange that Keyamo chose to jump on a rough voyage, for whatever reasons, to attempt to dissuade the PDP from testing these issues before the law courts.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the PDP is not surprised that Keyamo could offer such warped legal opinion picked off the shelves of \u2018Jankara\u2019 market since he admitted that his intervention was borne \u201cout of partisanship\u201d.\n\n\u201d It is imperative to advise Festus Keyamo that since he has admitted to partisanship and had even begun to offer legal services to a sinking Bello Matawalle and the APC, he cannot do so as a Minister of the Federal Republic, who earns a living from the taxes paid by Nigerians across party lines.\n\n\u201cThe PDP demands the immediate resignation of Keyamo as a minister and also advises him to join Matawalle\u2019s legal team in his already lost bid to run away with the mandate of the PDP.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The National Leadership of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) has commended Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for the state\u2019s secure and peaceful atmosphere as well as the giant feats his administration has recorded in infrastructural development with the limited resources at its disposal.\n\nAddressing newsmen after members of the National Executive Council (NEC) of ALGON inspected some projects being embarked upon by the Gov. Ugwuanyi administration across the state, the National Chairman of the association, Hon. Kolade David Alabi, said that \u201cmy impression about Enugu State is what the legal minds will call fact speaks for itself\u201d.\n\nThe ALGON National Chairman, who disclosed that they were in Enugu for their National Executive Council (NEC) meeting, stressed that \u201cGov. Ugwuanyi has done very well\u201d.\n\nHon. Alabi further said: \u201cI was completely amazed when I got to the College of Medicine (ESUT) that is being put in place by the Executive Governor.\n\n\u201cYou know this COVID-19 pandemic has already exposed that we have deficit of healthcare facilities, and what the governor is doing is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner for Information has told me that he (Ugwuanyi) has also provided Isolation Centres in the General Hospitals. That is commendable too.\n\n\u201cEnugu is peaceful; we have seen that; like I said, to measure a state is to look at the security of that state\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on ongoing calls for State Police, the ALGON boss urged the Federal Government to grant the request to enhance the security of the country.\n\n\u201cWe also use this medium as a point of contact to the Presidency that they should grant State Police because to me security is a bottom-top approach. It is not a top-bottom approach, and when we adopt this bottom-top approach to security then the country will be safe for all of us\u201d.\n\nHon. Alabi also applauded the Council Chairmen in Enugu State for their efforts in promoting peace, security and infrastructural development in the rural communities, adding: \u201cFrom what I have seen so far, they have also performed creditably well\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is not all about building infrastructure; it is also about investing in physiological infrastructure which is what we have seen. They are promoting peace, art and culture and it is a very good one.\n\n\u201cSo, thank you to the Chairman of ALGON in Enugu State (Hon. Solomon Onah) you have done well. Since yesterday we came into Enugu, the way you conducted the affairs of ALGON is the best in the country. I gave them a good mark yesterday and of course there is a reward for that.\n\n\u201cOur purpose in Enugu State is to hold our National Executive Council meeting and this is the third since we decided to be rotating our NEC meeting. Before now we use to hold our meeting in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe reason for doing that is that we want to assess the performance and the activities of all our people in various states and you agree with me that it is a good one.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit in Abuja and know what is going on in all the states and all the local government areas in the country\u201d.\n\nIn his remark, the Chairman of ALGON in Enugu State and Chairman of Udenu LGA, Hon. Onah, expressed delight at the verdicts by the national body of the association on the modest achievements of Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration and that of the council chairmen in the state.\n\nOn his part, the Commissioner for Information, Nnanyelugo Chidi Aroh, who led the team to the project sites such as the Nike Lake Road T-junction flyover bridge, Enugu East LGA, the Nsukka Township Stadium and the ESUT Teaching Hospital and College of Medicine projects, spoke on the significance of the projects to the health and socio-economic wellbeing of the people of Enugu State.\n\nThe Board of Trustees (BOT) Chairman of ALGON, Mr. Odunayo Adegbero, and some State and National Executive Council Members of the association accompanied the National President on the tour.",

Citizen\u2019s power keeps hope alive for our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, NYCN said the rejection is a victory for democracy and confirmation of the independence of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group, through its president, Isah Abubakar, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advisers against such controversial nominations to avoid a repeat of what could be described as a coup against the Nigeria Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe admonish the leaders of the National Assembly to continue to put Nigeria\u2019s democracy first above party/individual sentiments,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

The report was submitted by a team of House members led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the President urged leaders to respect the wishes of people and allow them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nHe also restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 states during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force.

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Doris Obinna\n\nNigerians have told the National Assembly to throw out the controversial Nigerian Press Council (NPC) and the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Acts amendment in its entirety.\n\nThis followed the disclosure by its sponsor, Olusegun Odebunmi, yesterday, that legislative process on it has been suspended.\n\nThe federal lawmaker from Oyo State, said on a live television programme, that he initiated the suspension to allow for consultation with stakeholders in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe have suspended the process for more consultation to happen on it. They demanded for a lot of time and I said \u2018no problem, we have given you; even if you spend three, four to five weeks\u2019. So far, more consultations from critical stakeholders, and many people have been submitting their memoranda to the National Assembly even within the industry.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi said his intention is not to gag the press, saying he recognises the lapses in the practice of journalism in Nigeria, and that the amendments are aimed at fixing those problems.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to gag the press, and unless all the practitioners can say all is well with the industry, to the best of my knowledge I know all is not well, and I know the National Assembly has the power to look into the existing Act. All is not well with the NPC agency, it is an agency of government, and you\u2019re expecting something to be given back to the society, but until now nothing has been coming from the agency.\u201d\n\nReacting, National President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, told Daily Sun that the body was not interested in the suspension but its outright cancellation.\n\n\u201cWe do not support a suspension. What we want as a body is for the bill to be completely thrown away, and if a new bill is to be made, all the relevant stakeholders must be carried along from inception.\u201d\n\nFormer national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Chekwas Okorie also called for the abolition of the bills.\n\n\u201cIt should be dropped completely because whatever was the intention for proposing the bill is definitely in very bad taste and has been rejected not just by the media practitioners, but Nigerians. The National Assembly should withdraw it completely without waiting for it to be rejected.\u201d\n\nNational President, Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mustapha Isa, said the National Assembly, in the first instance, has no right to amend a bill being challenged in the Supreme Court and insisted that suspension is not enough.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is outright dropping of the bill, not suspension. If they want to do another one, let them start by first having a meeting with stakeholders, so that we would collectively decide on what should be in the bill. You don\u2019t first put such a bill together before you start discussing with stakeholders. If you mean, before you put a bill together, ensure that you meet with us and not after.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the bill is anti-people and should be dropped completely.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbodiyan, said it did not come as a surprise that the Senate suspended further deliberations on the bill.\n\n\u201cIt portends danger for our collective freedom of speech and our constitutionally guaranteed access to information. It is very relieving that the Senate has suspended further deliberations on the satanic Bill, but we want it to be dropped permanently.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, commended the legislators for the suspension but demanded it should be thrown away because it is evil.\n\n\u201cWe should be making progress and doing the things that other developed nations are doing. We cannot go back to the analogue era when the world is going digital. We are in a global community. So, I commend them because they did well.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, praised the Senate for suspending the bill but said they should move a step further to drop it completely.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from all kinds of problems so much that to silence us or beat us and not allow us to cry is worsening our situation. So, the suspension is a good thing, but they should think of dropping it entirely.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonna, said the suspension is to enable them gather more public opinion about the bill to know the next line of action. \u201cSo, what they did is in order. I commend them for that.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary,Middle Belt Forum, Dogo Isuwa, said instead of rejoicing over the suspension, the media should first identify those areas in the Bill that are not making sense and enlighten Nigerians on the negative effects of those clauses, otherwise the National Assembly could still reintroduce the bill and pass into law in future.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, welcomed the suspension.\n\n\u201cThough the Senate said the bill is intended to regulate the media, the real intention is to gag the media. Afenifere believes in the freedom of expression, especially in a way that reflects the right of people to express their mind, but not in a scandalous or libelous manner. The bill should not have come up in the first place because there are various bodies that regulate the media.\u201d\n\nFormer chairman, Lagos NUJ chairman, Dr. Quasim Akinreti, said the voice of reason has prevailed with the suspension.\n\n\u201cThe initiator of that Bill jumped the gun without consulting stakeholders. For me, what the government is doing is not in the interest of the people.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says people should be free to choose leaders of their choice irrespective of party, religion\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria is lucky to have remained as one indivisible entity notwithstanding the myriad of problems incuding security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThis is just as he also canvassed for the citizens right to choose a leader of their choice at elections irrespective of party affiliation or religion.\n\nThe President made this disclosure Tuesday at the State House, Abuja while receiving the report of the National Security Summit of the House of Representatives from the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nPresident Buhari declared, \u201cwe are a lucky country and should congratulate ourselves, despite challenges that could have torn us apart.\u201d\n\nHe urged leaders to respect the people, from the lowest to the highest, \u201cso that it becomes a duty to them (the people) to pay back to the leadership.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, repect for the people should come in allowing them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nDescribing the event as \u201ca remarkable occasion,\u201d President Buhari restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 States during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the Ninth National Assembly for its cooperation with the Executive, the President said he tried very hard to get the Eighth Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much, but time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the very beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by the lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit, \u201cand Mr President was very eager and enthusiastic about it, showing the importance you place on security.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that will be implemented by the Executive.\n\n\u201cThank you Mr President for what you have done so far to douse tension and for Nigeria to remain one. It\u2019s about all of us, not just the Executive, the legislature or the judiciary. And Nigeria will work, by the grace of God\u201d, the Speaker further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "I May Die In DSS Custody Over Health Issues, Nnamdi Kanu Tells Court",
          "text": "The Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) leader and Radio Biafra Director, Nnamdi Kanu, has sued the Nigerian government over his continued detention at the national headquarters of the Department Of State Services.\n\nIn June, the IPOB leader was arrested in Kenya and extradited to Nigeria to face treason charges.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nHe was subsequently arraigned and brought before Binta Nyako, a Judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja, who asked him to be remanded at the DSS custody.\n\nKanu is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him at the court in response to his agitation for the Republic of Biafra.\n\nHe was granted bail in April 2017 on health grounds but skipped bail after disregarding some of the conditions given to him by the court.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Government Asked Us To Abduct You \u2013 Kenya Operatives Told Nnamdi Kanu, Chained Him To Floor For Six Days\n\nHowever, in a suit filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja through his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the IPOB leader prayed for a court order \"directing the transfer of the Applicant from the custody of the National Headquarters of the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before he was granted bail, pending the determination of the charge.\"\n\nHis lawyer also sought an \"An order of this Honourable Court directing the Defendant/Applicant's custodian, to grant access to his medical experts/doctors to carry out a comprehensive independent medical examination of the defendant/applicant's health condition/status, while in custody.\"\n\nKanu added that he might die if his health condition is not addressed promptly.\n\nRead the text of the charges below:\n\n\"That this charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came up on 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\n\n\n\"That the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO. FCH/ABJ/CR/383/2015 on that 29th June 2021.\n\n\"That on 30th June 2021, the Applicant's Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant. A copy of the said letter is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK 1. That on 2nd July 2021, at about 12:32pm, the State Security Service called me to inform me that our request to visit the Applicant has been approved and that I should come by 4:00 pm to see Defendant.\n\n\n\n\"That on the said 2nd July 2021 at about 5:00pm, at the State Security Headquarters, in Abuja, the Applicant informed me of the following facts which I verily believed to be accurate and correct as follows; That he was kidnapped and/or abducted by Kenyan Security Forces on 19th June 2021, specifically at Nairobi Airport.\n\n\n\n\"That he was detained by the personnel of the Kenyan Police Force for eight days, and was throughout this period of detention subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment, brutal torture, causing grave and severe heart problem that almost took his life. That he was detained in an unconventional facility, not necessarily a police detention center in Kenya.\n\n\n\n\"That throughout this detention in Kenya, he was never allowed access to his relatives before he was handed over to their Nigerian Security counterparts who smuggled him into Nigeria in clear violation of his rights. That since he was smuggled into this country on 27th June 2021, he has been kept in solitary confinement without access to his family members, relatives, wife, cousins, and children, except his lawyer, who only visits after they must secure the approval and endorsement of the Director-General of the State Security Service, which approval are not usually granted as a matter of course.\n\n\"That he is still being subjected to mental and psychological torture by his custodians, on account of the conditions of his solitary confinement. That an ECG examination was carried out on the Defendant, and it was discovered that the Defendant's heart had been enlarged by more than 13%, posing a serious threat and danger to Defendant's life.\n\n\n\n\"That there is a need for the Defendant to have access to his Medical Doctors to avert the danger looming against the life of the Defendant. That the health personnel attending to the Defendant in the custody of the State Security Service is not adequate considering the circumstances of the Defendant's health condition.\n\n\"That the Defendant requires the services of his medical experts as his medical records issued by the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital who has the Defendant's medical records, mainly, before the arrest/abduction of the Applicant shows a debilitating medical condition. Copies of these medical records showing the Applicant's subsisting health condition are hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK.\n\n\"That if the health condition of the Defendant is not addressed most promptly, the Defendant may die in custody, even before his trial. It is essential that the Defendant's Medical Experts/Consultants be allowed to carry out proper, thorough, and independent medical examinations of the Defendant to save the Defendant's life.\n\n\"That the Defendant needs regular medical observation/attention by the Defendant's Medical specialists/Consultants in Cardiology. That the Defendant's Medical Specialists (including the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital) in Kenya have his complete medical records that will easily aid the examination of the Defendant and treatment thereof.\n\n\"That the Defendant undertakes to bear any cost incidental to getting the medical experts to attend to his ill health while in custody. The defendant can only be alive to stand his trial, which cannot be guaranteed because of his rapidly deteriorating health situation.\n\n\"The Defendant cannot effectively put up a defense to the charge against him, in his present deteriorating health condition. That I know that upon the arraignment of the Applicant, this Honourable Court in its wisdom initially remanded the Applicant in Kuje Correctional Service Centre, where he was held for almost two years before bail was consequently granted to the Applicant.\n\n\n\n\"That for the almost two years the Applicant was in custody in Kuje Correctional Facility, there was never any complaint about any form of misconduct against him. That the State Security Service is not a detention Centre, neither does it have the requisite custodial facilities to enhance the conditions of the occupants/inmates.\n\n\"That the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre is an impartial facility that has no interest whatsoever in the outcome of this charge. That the Nigerian Correctional Service Center is the only body statutorily empowered to keep custody of persons facing criminal trial in courts, hence, the necessity to transfer the Applicant to the Nigerian Correctional Service Center Kuje.\n\n\n\n\"That it will serve the interest of Justice and enhance fair hearing for this Honourable Court to transfer the Applicant from the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\n\n\"That the Applicant has very limited access to his lawyers, who can only visit him after the approval of the Director of the State Security Services has been first sought and obtained, which said approval in most cases, takes days and that the above situation would greatly impede the Defendant's preparation for his defense to the charge against him.\n\n\n\n\"That the favorable consideration of this application is compelling in the circumstance of the present Notice for the resumption of the Court's Annual vacation, which would affect the hearing on the substantive charge already slated for the 26th Day of July 2021. That fair hearing can only be guaranteed when the Applicant is not remanded in the custody of his accusers.\n\n\"That it is a fact that Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. That it will greatly aid and serve the interest of Justice if this application is granted. That the respondent will not be prejudiced by the grant of this application. That I depose to this affidavit in good faith believing same to be true and correct and in accordance with the oath Act.\"\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.",

She had alleged that the businessman forcefully had sex with her the first time but a dispute ensued after he attempted it again.\n\n\u201cI threw the knife to the bed and he was going for it but I also went for it. He dragged the knife with me and it broke and he fell on the floor,\u201d she had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a recent interview that surfaced on Monday, Chidinma said she admitted to killing Ataga at the time because of pressure and the fact that nobody believed her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened when I left the room to buy food. Because of what I did after by not alerting the police and also withdrawing money from his account, I feel guilty for what happened but I did not kill him,\u201d she had said.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "A High Court in Kenya has ordered Safaricom to pay a blind man KSh6 million ($56,000) for failing to hire him after he had gone through the entire recruitment process.\n\nWilson Macharia sued the network operator to seek compensation because his rights were violated, BusinessDaily reported. He told Justice James Makau that Safaricom declined to employ him as a customer care executive on grounds that it did not have specialised software to help him with his work.\n\nMacharia said he responded to an advert by Safaricom in August 2016 for a customer experience executive position, which invited qualified Kenyans irrespective of \u201crace, colour, religion, gender, tribal origin, disability or age\u201d.\n\nAlong with other persons living with disabilities, Macharia was shortlisted for the job, went through the oral interview and medical test, after which he was invited to sign the contract in July 2017. However, Safaricom said the invite was erroneous.\n\nIn its defense, the telecoms firm denied discriminating against the plaintiff and argued that it allowed Macharia to be interviewed for the job but that it lacked specialised software that would enable him to work.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company violated Macharia\u2019s rights and failed to treat him with dignity as it should have informed him earlier that the software was unavailable instead of making him go through the recruitment process only to later claim the letter was sent erroneously.\n\n\u201cI find that the Respondent\u2019s excuse to be an afterthought that was introduced late to the detriment of the Petitioner. The Respondent knew right from the beginning that the Petitioner\u2019s work called for software, yet they took him through all recruitment steps,\u201d Justice Makau ruled.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that there are over 650 million people around the world who live with disabilities; 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school and the literacy rate for adults with disabilities is as low as 3%.\n\nIn addition, millions of people with disabilities want to get jobs but can\u2019t get hired. Even in developed economies, they struggle to find employment.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Visa has partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Flutterwave has appointed Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nIn a statement, the company said Falade\u2019s role will be to provide \u201cstrategic oversight and government relation strategies, while ensuring that the interest and needs of the business are aligned with that of the regulators.\u201d\n\nFalade joins Flutterwave from a similar role at IHS Towers, the Nigerian company that owns 29,700 telecom towers across nine countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Sub Saharan Africa.\n\nBefore IHS, he spent 10 years at MTN in various government and regulatory advisory roles, and four years representing VISA in conversations with West African regulators.\n\nIn appointing a regulatory lead with broad industry experience, Flutterwave expresses an enthusiasm for deeper engagement with African governments. Like other private organisations, tech companies have to answer to the constituted authorities wherever they operate.\n\nThe duty is arguably more pressing and sensitive if the company operates in the financial services industry, where consumer protection and fraud prevention are government priorities.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s payments processing business is live in 33 African countries. That spread commands a regulatory burden similar to what multinational financial services companies and telecommunications networks have to contend with. It may have figured in their selection process for a regulatory lead, choosing someone with experience spanning these sectors.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, has high hopes for Falade\u2019s impact on the company: \u201c[He is] well placed to strengthen our existing relationships as well as support us create new relationships.\u201d\n\nAgboola has been intentional about praising regulators publicly.\n\nWhen the company announced its $170m Series C in March, he cheered the Central Bank of Nigeria for being \u201cat the forefront of the significant efforts that are currently being made by African governments to create the enabling environment for technology, innovation and financial inclusion.\u201d\n\nHe described the regulator as being part of the \u201cbackbone upon which companies like Flutterwave have been able to thrive\u201d in addition to employees, customers and investors.\n\nNo surprises then that Flutterwave would seek to strengthen its relationship with regulators like the CBN in Nigeria and those in the other countries the company operates in.\n\nFalade, in Flutterwave\u2019s statement announcing his appointment, said he believes companies and regulators share the same goal of growing businesses and economies through technology and is relishing his new opportunity to make that happen.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: 25 years after Beijing declaration, Nigerian women still underrepresented in media leadership roles",
          "text": "The current bureau chief for the Guardian Newspaper in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Bridget Onochie, is the first female to attain such a position in the medium.\n\nMrs Onochie said she started her media career with the organisation as a book reviewer more than 15 years ago while taking part in the mandatory national youth service scheme by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nHaving passionately worked with the platform as a corps member, she was employed in 2005 by the newspaper after passing out from the scheme.\n\nBut like her other colleagues in the newsroom, she experienced the unthinkable. There was no promotion for 12 years.\n\n\u201cI was not promoted between 2005 and 2017; there was no promotion but when this one came, I jumped all other steps and was made the head of bureau,\u201d Ms Onochie said.\n\nHowever, rather than remaining stagnant on the job while waiting to be promoted, Mrs Onochie said she engaged in self-development by pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Creative Art and later a Doctoral degree which she bagged in 2015. In 2017, she was moved from the art desk to cover parliament proceedings.\n\n\u201cAlthough promotion was not forthcoming, I didn\u2019t despair and it was not because I was a woman but it was the general atmosphere with the leadership of the medium at that time.\n\n\u201cWhen the medium thought it necessary to engage an in-house person as the head of bureau in March 2017, many things would have spoken for me but I think that they may have looked at other people in the newsroom and I feel self-development offered me an added advantage,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Onoche\u2019s story paints a picture of the reality in many Nigerian newsrooms.\n\nStatistics\n\nA study conducted by this reporter among leading media organisations in Nigeria in the course of this report reveals that out of a total of 50 managerial positions, only 32 per cent are occupied by women, while 68 per cent by men.\n\nFor instance, of the eight members of the management board at Premium Times Newspaper, only two are women.\n\nThe management team on Channels TV is composed of 14 members, only four are women. At the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), nine members make up the management team, with women occupying only three positions. For Daily Trust, only two women occupy managerial positions among the available 10 slots.\n\nThe study also captured the number of women represented in West Africa\u2019s first non-for-profit newsroom- Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), where five out of nine managerial positions are women.\n\nBeijing Declaration\n\nThe Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) 2020 report notes that the news media lag in offering inclusive spaces for women, vulnerable and historically marginalised groups.\n\nThese findings come 25 years after the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China, with the theme; \u201cAction for Equality Development and Peace.\u201d\n\nAt the conference, 189 countries, including Nigeria, adopted a resolution that was tagged Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPFA).\n\nThe BPFA mapped out 12 critical areas in which women are said to be disempowered and drafted strategic objectives and actions for member states to achieve gender equality in all spheres, including the media.\n\nThis visionary agenda is still regarded as the most comprehensive global policy framework and a blueprint for action to realise gender equality and uphold the rights of women and girls globally.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut according to the 2020 GMMP report, though the last five years have seen substantial incremental changes towards parity in subjects and sources, there is still a long distance to cover.\n\nThis is evident in the global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. In Nigeria in particular, among health specialists who appeared on televisions on COVID-19 related news, only one of the five was a woman.\n\nThe story is the same in South Africa and India, a 2020 report titled; the missing perspectives of women in COVID-19 news and commissioned by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, observes.\n\nVarious other studies have also shown that women pursuing a career in the communication sector are yet to attain positions at the decision-making level or serve on governing boards that influence media policies. Glass ceilings appear to be setting in on specific important news media gender equality indicators, while others are edging upwards.\n\nIn Luba Kassova\u2019s \u2018The Missing Perspective\u2019 (2020), globally, women remain the minority in newsrooms and in news management structures where only 33 per cent of newsroom managers are women.\n\nThe report also noted that women journalists are much more likely to work on lower-profile news beats than higher profile, agenda-setting ones.\n\nInhibiting factors\n\nExperts have identified some natural tendencies which they claim tend to serve as barriers to women\u2019s development and progress in society. These tendencies include culture, intra-gender rivalry and inadequacies by a section of males who they believe feel threatened by women in power.\n\n\u201cThe society is structured in a way that prioritises the makeup of a woman and assumes that women will not be able to govern a country or a society but remember also that the battle is open. If you think you are strong as a woman, then you go ahead,\u201d Ms Onochie advises.\n\nShe noted that though her position gives her room to influence decisions and policies, many management meetings relate to the organisation and not necessarily about women.\n\n\u201cThe only decision has to do with the organisation and if you bring good ideas, no one shuts you down based on your gender. I have never been shut down,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ms Onochie, the media operates like a paramilitary setup and does not factor the gender perspective. She said due to the media\u2019s peculiar nature, anyone who chooses to be redundant by virtue of their gender would become irrelevant.\n\n\u201cWomen who are relevant in the media are those who have carved out their time and energy to work in the sector,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Oluwatosin Alagbe, the programme director of PTCIJ noted that gender-equality management has helped the organisation to offer both men and women, equal training and career-building opportunities.\n\nShe added that it has also helped with designing and implementing policies that make the team thrive.\n\n\u201cWith a gender-equal management team, we hope we are able to ensure that the content we push out is balanced across gender lines. We also hope that others are encouraged to make women occupy all roles, including management roles, in newsrooms,\u201d she said.\n\nAmid the variations in managerial positions, many believe competency and relevance are key factors to consider when discussing issues around gender equality.\n\nChanging narratives\n\nIn 2017, the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) initiated the Female Reporters Leadership Programme (FRLP) to create a balance between opportunities and representation of women to men in Nigerian society by supporting female reporters with the tools, finesse and skills they need to qualify for leadership positions in their respective media houses.\n\nMotunrayo Alaka, the WSCIJ\u2019s executive director said the Reports Women FRLP was created to address ethical, equity and sustainability issues in the media.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that the topmost echelons of newsrooms and media organisations were mens\u2019 clubs and we thought that was not OK on so many grounds\n\n\u201cWhen we did a survey about the status of female persons in Nigeria\u2019s newsrooms, there were newsrooms that did not even have any female persons in editorial board or management and in some there were seven men to two women. If the media prescribes to the society what and how it should be, then the media itself should live up to this expectation by showing that equity,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Alaka observed that if the media sidelines women who make up nearly half of Nigeria\u2019s population in news reporting, they lose out on funding opportunities that support inclusiveness on all sides.\n\nShe added; \u201cThe media talks about sustainability and the fact that revenues are dwindling but when you tell half the story, you get half the funds.\n\n\u201cThat is why WSCIJ is working hard on a source guide that is focused on women sources. If there are women there, it would make sense for the media to tell the stories of women because there are women who will buy their products, who would be interested in the news they are telling.\u201d\n\nAccording to the 2020 FRLP Impact Assessment report, of the 41 fellows who completed the survey, 24, representing 59 per cent, have been promoted or given higher responsibilities in their organisations after the fellowship.\n\nSimilarly, the African Women in Media (AWiM) is currently developing an expert roster, which it says will serve as a central database for female experts across several industries in the world.\n\nAWiM is an international non-governmental organisation that aims to positively impact the way media functions in relation to African women.\n\nAccording to Yemisi Akinbobola, the founder of AWiM, the roster aims to ensure that female perspective on key global issues is captured and that women are fully represented in media content.\n\n\u201cIf we are saying that women are over 50 per cent represented in the world, then we need to represent that in media content,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of relevance and competence, Ms Akinbobola said the media is filled with many biases that need to be addressed, such as roles assigned to male and female reporters.\n\nShe added; \u201cWomen who make up the majority of journalism students in tertiary institutions become the minority group in the industry and this is because women are disenfranchised by the very nature of their gender, even at the point of entry.\n\n\u201cFor example, Mary and John entered at the same time and John is asked to go and cover politics and Mary, fashion. When training opportunities arise, men are prioritised because they are reporting politics and economics. Who needs the training to report on fashion?\u201d\n\nThese gendered allocations of opportunities, according to her, favours one gender over the other.\n\n\u201cHis career is moving faster because he is allowed to produce content that would get him the award and meet people that elevate his profile as well as pieces of training that give him that competence needed,\u201d Ms Akinbobola said.\n\nIn the 2020 report published by AWiM, which is titled; \u201cBarriers to Female Journalists in Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d a significant 36 per cent of the respondents attributed their barriers of progression to the lack of a gender policy focusing on progression at their organisation.\n\nThe study also found that where gender policies exist, they have not necessarily led to transformative change within the respective context.\n\nMs Akinbobola, a one-time recipient of the prestigious CNN Africa Journalist Award, recommends that media organisations develop a transparent approach to leadership where there are clear progressional structures.\n\nShe also encourages women to establish strong networks among themselves where they can collectively push for policies that concern them within their organisations.\n\nShe said; \u201cA typical example is Standard Media in Kenya where women have established a network known as Her Network through which a gender policy has been developed and a creche for new mothers and their babies have been established to make work easier for them.\n\n\u201cTechnology also gives women opportunities to build their brand and take up an entrepreneurial approach to their careers\u201d.\n\nImprovement\n\nDespite these barriers confronting women in the media, Mrs Alaka believes that there has been significant improvement since the Beijing conference in 1995.\n\nShe said; \u201cWe don\u2019t have much to say about that when we talk about the political landscape of our country, we are going south.

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

It has nothing to do with Rivers people.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, RVF President, Comrade Dominic Dumekpigi, said the group has began moves to ensure that more youths participate in elections in Rivers State, ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nDumekpigi said: \u201cAs a grassroot mobilization group, we owe ourselves the truth and the truth is to ensure we continue to defend what is just in a bid to enhance peaceful coexistence as members of the same family.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, RVF came up after the 2019 general election, having seen our chances and chances of our political leaders who share same vision of playing politics without bitterness and acrimony.\u201d",
          "summary": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Chief Tony Okocha, has declared that the Minister of Transportation, Rt.\nChibuike Rotimi Amaechi, cannot decide where the next governor of the state will come from in 2023.\nThe APC chieftain stated that it was not the responsibility of any individual to zone the governorship position of the state to any zone of region.\nHe said: \u201cWell, he spoke his mind; he didn\u2019t speak the mind of the party.\nIt has nothing to do with Rivers people.\u201dEarlier in his welcome address, RVF President, Comrade Dominic Dumekpigi, said the group has began moves to ensure that more youths participate in elections in Rivers State, ahead of the 2023 general elections.",

          "title": "Appointments: Gov Makinde Fair To Oyo Muslims \u2013 NSCIA",
          "text": "The Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has declared that contrary to the accusation that the state governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, was biased against Muslims in the appointment of commissioners in his dissolved cabinet, the governor has, indeed, been fair to the Muslim Ummah in all the activities and programmes of his administration.\n\nIt added that views contained in a recent press statement purportedly authored on behalf of the Muslim Community of Oyo State did not represent the position of the Muslim Ummah in the state.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the NSCIA in Oyo State, Alhaji Shaikh Busairi; the Grand Mufti of the Council, Alhaji Khalifah Yusuf Alagunfon and the Public Relations Officer of the Council, Alhaji Sulayman Seriki, made this position during a visit to the office of the Special Assistant to Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde on Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Imam AbdRasheed AbdulAzeez.\n\nThe trio, who spoke to journalists in Ibadan, the state capital, warned Muslim leaders to avoid hypocrisy and playing to the gallery.\n\nA statement signed by the Special Assistant (Print Media) to Governor Makinde, Moses Alao, quoted the Council as urging those criticising Makinde in the name of the Muslim community to stop being ungrateful to Allah for what he has done for the Muslim Ummah through the governor.\n\nThe statement maintained that contrary to the claim that only five of the commissioners in the recently dissolved cabinet were Muslims, eight of the 16 former commissioners were actually Muslims.\n\nWhile speaking, the Secretary-General of the Council, Shaikh Busairi said: \u201cIt is not wrong to advise the government on any issue. What is wrong is that anyone that intends well or means well should not play to the gallery when advising. That is an erroneous approach. If you actually mean well, there is nothing stopping you from making contact with the government, especially now that we have an SA on Islamic Affairs. You can channel our affairs through that office.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, we have gone into the archives to search into what actually used to transpire in government in Oyo State. We found out that the number of Muslim Commissioners in the previous government were not up to the number we had in the first two years of Governor Makinde.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut it has been the antics of the people behind that writing; they always cook up stories in the corners of their rooms and use such stories to represent the entire population of Muslims in the state. We in the NSCIA have been critical of that kind of approach. If at all we want to help the cause of Muslims and the cause of Islam, there are better ways.\n\n\u201cAnything that is going to represent the interest of the Muslims in a community, such things should be aired at a meeting of all interest groups. But that did not happen. If it did, then maybe they would have had reasonable information that would have dissuaded them from writing that open letter. So, in a nutshell, they are not representing the interest of Muslims in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the NSCIA, there was no bias in the appointments made in the state. In fact, we have been at the vanguard of telling the public that Governor Makinde has been fair to Muslims. In the last two years, he has not been found wanting in terms of doing that which was never in existence in the state before.\n\nHe said that among things, the governor has been identifying with Muslims, stating that Makinde has never been found wanting in terms of fairness to Muslims.\n\n\u201cBut we know the antics of those who signed that statement; they are just trying to cry wolf where there is none just to register that they are still in existence.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow such misrepresentation to go on; that is why we have come to the SA Islamic Affairs to register that what we are reading on the social media is not to our knowledge and that we do not subscribe to what they wrote in that press release and that they are not representing the interests of Muslims in the state. The views they expressed only represent the opinion of their clique and they know what they are gunning for. But they will never realise their diabolical ambition,\u201d Busairi added.\n\nSimilarly, the Grand Mufti of NSCIA, Oyo State, Alh. Alagunfon maintained that the governor has been fair to Muslims, urging those behind the criticism of Governor Makinde to soft-pedal, because \u201cMakinde has done very well for the Muslim Ummah and we should not be ungrateful to him.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the SA Islamic Affairs, Imam AbdulAzeez appreciated the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, for visiting his office, urging them to continue to encourage Muslims to support Governor Makinde\u2019s government and to pray for its success.\n\nAccording to AbdulAzeez, Governor Makinde\u2019s government will always be fair to Islam and other religions, adding that the governor is \u201ca lover of Islam and Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I once said, His Excellency has been a blessing to Islam and the Muslims in Oyo State. His government has undertaken several efforts that demonstrate that the governor believes in fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cWe have the celebration of Mawlud Nabiyy and declaration of Hijrah as public holiday, donation of buses to Islamic organisations including The Central Mosque of Ibadan land, Lanase Central Mosque, Sabo Central Mosque (of the Hausa community) and the maintenance of the use of Hijabs in schools in the state, among others, to show for the governor\u2019s fair disposition.\n\n\u201cMuslims should, therefore, continue to pray for the success of this administration and Oyo state at large,\u201d AbdulAzeez said.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu on Wednesday disclosed that more suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of Super TV Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Usifo Ataga.\n\nOdumosu said this at a news conference and parade of 1,320 hoodlums and miscreants at the Police Command, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nHe did not disclose the number of people arrested, but said investigation was still ongoing.\n\nOdumosu said the prime suspect, Chidinma Ojokwu, 21, was still a suspect with her rights guaranteed by the constitution, dismissing insinuations the police were attempting to give her a soft landing.\n\nOdumosu said: \u201cWe have established a case of conspiracy in the murder and we have arrested more suspects.\u201d\n\nHowever, the police commissioner said recently, the Command established some tactical units to tackle the new dimensions of social vices in the state.\n\n\u201cThis has paid off. Many cases that were recorded have been unravelled while many suspects arrested have been prosecuted. Isolated cases of robbery in traffic have also been tackled.\n\n\u201cThe perennial gridlock in the city is attributable to numerous road rehabilitations that are simultaneously going on in almost all parts of the city.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this on robbery in traffic is being adequately taken care of by the command The tactical teams and other science-based units of the Command have put their resources together to reduce these menaces to their barest minimum in Lagos State, since no society is absolutely free of crimes,\u201d he said.\n\nOdumosu added that due to the general appraisal of security of the state and robust intelligence gathering, the Command has embarked on constant raid of flash points, where miscreants who terrorise innocent people of Lagos State, especially attacking them in traffic, hibernate across the state.\n\nAccording to him, the idea was to be proactive and take the fight against crimes and criminality to their dens, disclosing that the Command, is parading 1,320 miscreants/hoodlums who were raided at various locations across the state and that many dangerous weapons, suspected hard drugs and weeds suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered from them.\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to reiterate its determination and commitment to harness all available means of reducing crimes and social vices in Lagos State as required of the Police,\u201d he said.",

According to him, such can only happen if those killed were staying with the bandits in the forest.

I feel its important I address this report. I just got off the phone with Alhaji Mohammad Ibrahim, the Director of Security, Ministry of Internal Security, Zamfara State who confirmed the happiness of the State Government over the precise nature of the strike by NAF jet.\n\nI am also aware that the State Governor has called our Commanders on ground to commend the NAF.\n\nA local contractor in the general area also confirmed the attack and its devastating effect on the bandits. Till now, the remnants of the bandits are evacuating and departing from the Sububu Forest general area.\n\nNow, the strike was in Sububu Forest and not anywhere close to any village. So stories of NAF hitting any target outside the Forest is false.

          "text": "The Nigerian political arena is currently agog with declarations and bids of many political heavyweights to succeed the incumbent President Mohammadu Buhari who will step aside in 2023 after his mandatory eight years in office. While some of the candidates are operating lip service structures, His Excellency Owelle Rochas Ethelbert Anayo Okorocha, a distinguished senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, already has a formidable structure that is making a strong impact in the six geo-political zones.\n\nThat is why his office, the Nigerian Unity House, is currently besieged by multifarious groups to endorse the presidential ambition of the Ogboko born charismatic politician. For the past two months, the unity house has become one of the busiest centers in Abuja with courtesy calls from not less than 1000 different groups from Owelle\u2019s beloved North West, North East, North Central, South West, South-South, and his indigenous South East.\n\nAll the various groups came with one swan- song, that Owelle stands the best chance to emerge victorious in 2023and extend his RESCUE MISSION mantra to Nigeria. In fact, one of the enthusiastic groups, the Nigerian Youths Alternative Council threatened to initiate litigations against Owelle if he does do not respond to their clarion call to officially declare for the presidency. Moreover, the mothers and other female groups were not left out. Recently, the Omalicha Umuadalgbo worldwide equally visited to extol his good dreams for New Nigeria that will actualize the gender balance for marginalized female folks.\n\nAs charity begins at home, his kinsmen from Umuma Ebemmano clan made up of 14 large communities in ldeato south LGA Imo state stormed the unity house to endorse and encourage the pride of their clan that the coast is clear for him to emerge as next president of Nigeria in 2023. During the courtesy call, their leader, Engr Jude Anayo Ibe thanked Owelle for his dynamic leadership and rescue mission in lmo state. Another respected royal father and elder from the community.\n\nHRH Ichie Uche Chineke. Chairman Eze lgbo Traditional Council FCTnot only prayed for God\u2019s grace to Owelle but crowned the courtesy visit with the presentation of a unique Igbosymbolicwalking stickof authoritythat will banish all unforeseen ugly forces that might stand as the Rock of Gibraltar against Owelle\u2019s march to Aso rock. The community women leader, Lolo Charity Ego Duru assured that their prayers will send a legion of Anges to protect and lead Owelle to the promised land. The question remains. Why are so many groups from the Nigerian six geo-political zones drumming support for Owelle Rochas? The answer lies simply in his detribalized credentials, religious piety, transparency, and philanthropism which have transformed the wellbeing of people in all parts of Nigeria.\n\nIn fact, there is no Nigerian geo-political zone that has not benefited from Rochas Foundation Colleges and multifarious investments in the 36 states of the federation. As messianic Governor of Imo state, his 8 years rescue mission moved the heartland state to the next level via ecumenical center, 27 standard hospitals, new government house, free education, school buildings in all the wards, universities, cargo airport, stadiums, palm revolution, best judicial infrastructure, community watch, civil guard and intra city road networks. Just like many Imo communities, his beloved Umuma Ebemmano clan was equally turned into a mini-city with universities, road networks, widows houses, youth vehicles, hospitals, modern schools, boreholes, etc.\n\nToday, with the numerous visitations and endorsement from Nigerians at his unity house, the coast is clear for Owelle to emerge as Nigerian President in 2023. His wealth of experience and leadership acumen in the political, religious academic, cultural, economic, and social realm will not only put the nation on strong footing but lead to the actualization of New Nigerian manifest destiny as a true giant of Africa and leader of the black world.\n\nLong live Excellency Owelle Rochas Ehelbert Anayo Okorocha, Nigerian detribalized servant leader with the Midas touch to take Nigeria to the NEXT level as President in 2023.\n\n\u2026 Chief Duruis is an Abuja based political analyst and policy advocate",

          "title": "Messi Agrees Five-year Barcelona Contract, Takes Huge Pay Cut: ESPN",
          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, with star accepting a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay, ESPN reports.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500 million over four years and that expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1 billion. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on August 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nThe report claims that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi in April that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",
