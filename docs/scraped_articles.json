          "text": "The Federal Government on Tuesday said it had delivered Moderna vaccine doses to 28 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nIt added that eight states had yet to receive the vaccine because they lacked requisite vaccine storage capacity, especially backup cold chain facilities.\n\nThe Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Faisal Shuaib, disclosed this at a joint briefing on COVID-19 vaccination by his agency, the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund and the World Health Organisation in Abuja.\n\nHe said the second phase of vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine would formally begin on Wednesday (today) and would end on September 5.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo far, we have deployed Moderna vaccine to 28 states and the FCT. It is pertinent to state that we could not deploy the vaccine immediately after NAFDAC certification because, unlike the AstraZeneca, the Moderna vaccine did not come with complete bar-coding. And this is needed for us to track the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe remaining eight states that we have not deployed the vaccine to have not demonstrated readiness in terms of their cold chain capacity.\n\n\u201cWhile they have the ultra-cold chain that the Federal Government supplied, we also require that they have backup cold chain equipment.\n\n\u201cFor these eight states that have not provided that type of backup plan, we are holding on to the vaccine to ensure that they are adequately prepared before we send the vaccine.\u201d\n\nShuaib did not disclose the affected states\n\nOgun, Borno begin vaccination\n\nMeanwhile, the Ogun State government has said it has set up 131 COVID-19 vaccination sites, including 105 fixed sites, as the exercise begins in the state.\n\nThe government, which took delivery of 187,426 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses on Thursday, said it listed Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, general hospitals and primary health facilities across the 20 councils among 105 fixed sites for easy access to vaccination.\n\nThe Commissioner of Health, Dr Tomi Coker, who said over 126,000 residents were vaccinated in the first phase of the exercise, added that the second phase of the vaccination would run between August 23 and September 11.\n\nShe added, \u201cCurrently, in Ogun State, the number of confirmed cases is 5,181 with 73 deaths being 1.4 per cent of the total number of cases.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Borno State Government said it started the vaccination on Monday after taking delivery of 63,336 doses of moderna vaccine last Wednesday.\n\nThe acting Director, Disease Control and Immunization, Dr Goni Abatcha, said, \u201cEight local government areas in central and northern Borno started yesterday (Monday).

          "title": "PDP splits as two chairmen emerge, Wike, Secondus divide NWC",
          "text": "\u2022Anti-Secondus faction fixes emergency NEC for Friday\n\n\u2022Pro-national chairman faction suspends NWC meeting indefinitely\n\n\u2022Protesters storm party secretariat\n\nNigeria\u2019s leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, was on Tuesday factionalised with the emergence of two acting national chairmen.\n\nThe two Deputy National Chairmen of the party, Yemi Akinwonmi (South) and Senator Suleiman Nazif (North), in separate announcements on Tuesday, claimed to be the party\u2019s acting National Chairman.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that while Akinwonmi was loyal to the Rivers State Governor, Mr Nyesom Wike, Nazif had the support of the suspended National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus.\n\nA Rivers State High Court presided over by Justice O. Gbasam of the Degema Judicial Division vacation court, sitting in Port Harcourt, had on Monday granted an order restraining Secondus from parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\n\nThis was sequel to the consideration of an ex parte application in suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 filed by Ibeabuchi Alex, Dennis Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen and Umezirike Onucha against Uche Secondus (1st defendant) and the PDP (2nd defendant).\n\nOn Tuesday, Akinwonmi issued a statement declaring himself as the acting national chairman in the absence of Secondus, citing Section 45 (2) of the PDP Constitution.\n\nHis statement read in part, \u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening (Monday) to a court order, which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\n\u201cSection 45(2) (b) of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party empowers me to summon and preside over party meetings in the absence of the national chairman.\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party, after consultation and in exercise of the aforesaid powers, I hereby deem it fit and proper to postpone the National Working Committee meeting earlier scheduled for today (Tuesday) until further notice to allow for broader consultation in the overall interest of our party.\u201d\n\nA few hours after the statement, members of the party\u2019s NWC under the leadership of Nazif stormed the PDP national secretariat in company with armed policemen and went straight into the NWC conference room for a meeting that started around 2pm.\n\nSoon after the meeting, which lasted about 40 minutes, Nazif addressed the media.\n\nHe said, \u201cMembers of the NWC will recall that this morning, we were in possession of a valid court order from a high court in Degema, Rivers State, issuing an order removing Secondus as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party as well as the national chairman of our great party.\n\n\u201cA court has also ordered that from August 23, 2021, Prince Uche Secondus should stop parading himself as the national chairman. The NWC hereby complies fully with the court order.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the NWC hereby calls for an emergency NEC meeting on Friday, August 27, 2021, at 10am prompt to deliberate on matters affecting the party. You are all aware that the PDP is a law-abiding party, the party that follows due process. So, we have received this order and this is it.\n\n\u201cAnd in line with the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party, and I quote Section 35, 3 a-d, \u2018Functions of a deputy national chairman: there shall be two deputy national chairman, one shall come from the northern part, while the other from the southern part of the country. The deputy national chairmen shall perform the following functions: 1) assist the national chairman in the discharge of his duty. 2) Perform such other functions as may be assigned to them.\n\n\u201c3) In a result of resignation, removal, death, incapacitation or absence of the national chairman, a deputy national chairman from the region part of the country where the national chairman originates from shall assume office as the national chairman in acting capacity without prejudice to Section 47 (6) of the party Constitution. 4) In the absence of the national chairman and the deputy national chairman from the region or part of the country where the national chairman originates from, the other deputy national chairman shall act as the national chairman without prejudice to Section 47 (6) of this Constitution.\n\n\u201cOn this note, distinguished NWC members, I hereby take full charge of the Peoples Democratic Party as chairman in an acting capacity.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining his reason for taking over, Nazif said, \u201cWe have waited this morning for the deputy national chairman (South), who has been incapacitated and who has not been attending the NWC meetings in the last nine months. As you know, in the absence of the deputy chairman (South), I take full charge; so, I am hereby calling for an emergency NEC meeting for August 27, 2021, by 10am prompt to deliberate on the new development.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe all the leaders of this party, the owners of this party, will be in attendance and that our governors and former presiding officers will be part of the NEC meeting to deliberate on all pending issues.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question as to whether there was now a division among members of the NWC, he said, \u201cLet me make this very clear that this meeting was called for 2pm and like I said, the deputy national chairman, South, has been incapacitated and did not attend any meeting in the last nine to 10 months as far as the NWC is concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has not been in communication with any member of the NWC for the last 10 months. This party must continue its process.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am not available, someone else will take over. If the national chairman is not available, someone will take over; if the deputy national chairman, South, is not available, the deputy chairman, North, will take charge.\n\n\u201cThis is the resolution that was passed by the expanded caucus. And this was the resolution passed by the NWC at our last meeting and we all agreed that there would be a meeting today, a meeting that was supposed to be presided over by the national chairman; unfortunately, the court order came from a competent court and stopped the chairman from acting as the chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThose who attended the meeting presided over by Nazif included the PDP National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Adamu Mustapha; National Vice Chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih; his South-East counterpart, Ali Odefa; National Vice-Chairman, South-West, Toafeek Arapaja; and National Youth Leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye.\n\nEarlier, a group of protesters stormed the National Secretariat of the party to protest in favour of Secondus.\n\nThe protesters accused Wike of being the brains behind Secondus\u2019 problems and displayed placards with inscriptions such as: \u2018Secondus Must Stay\u2019, \u2018PDP is a Law-Abiding Party\u2019, and \u2018Wike, leave Secondus alone\u2019.\n\nAt a press conference in Lagos, Akinwonmi said the crisis rocking the opposition party would not affect its fortunes in the coming elections.\n\nHe added that the zonal congress of the party would hold as scheduled.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe crisis rocking our party will not in any way affect its chances in future elections. When they say someone is a chairman, there are some people working for the party. So, the chairman of the party is just there to direct the affairs of the party; the people doing the work are there.\n\n\u201cThe crisis won\u2019t affect the planned zonal congresses; they will hold as scheduled.\u201d\n\nHe also refused to blame Secondus for the crisis in the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from a culture where you don\u2019t blame your boss; Secondus is my boss, I don\u2019t know what led to the crisis; so, it will be difficult to comment or blame anybody for the crisis,\u201d he added.\n\nAkinwonmi, who arrived at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja around 5.20pm, addressed secretariat staff members, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a man of peace and not a man of crisis.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has a good succession order. The National Chairman, Uche Secondus, is the head of all of us followed by the Deputy National Chairman 1, which I am.\n\n\u201cIt is the call of duty that caused me to be here. I come to address you as the acting national chairman. All other meetings conducted in which I was not here are null and void. At the appropriate time, I will arrange for a proper meeting of the party.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the media soon afterwards, Akinwonmi admitted that he was ill at some point, but that he was better now.\n\n\u201cSickness is not the friend of anybody. I was coming to Wadata House here and I had a stroke; I was in Cedar Crest Hospital for three months. I\u2019m getting better now; my recovery rate is up to 70 per cent now. I trekked from the car park to this place,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking on the occasion, the National Secretary of the party, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri, explained that there were no factions in the PDP.\n\nHe stated, \u201cToday, we are here to adopt the doctrine of necessity as the PDP is a law-abiding party. The meeting that was held this afternoon was because I sent the notices for the meeting yesterday (Monday). We were not aware of the judgment of the court in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was fixed for 2pm; unfortunately, the Deputy National Chairman (South) had not arrived at the time and in line with our constitution, at such times, his counterpart from the North presided over the meeting.\n\n\u201cThere is no division. We have given our lawyers the judgment; they will look at it and advise us. After this meeting, I will sit with Akinwonmi and prepare for NEC; after the NEC, we will prepare for the convention, which will be held very soon.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nLaments abandonment of region by FG, security agencies\n\n\u2026.Condemns continued killings of UniJos students\n\nBy Chris Ochayi, ABUJA\n\nThe Youth Wing of the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has taken a swipe at the Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, over its position on the killing of some Ondo State-bound travellers in Jos, the Plateau State capital while accusing the group of fanning the embers of violence.\n\nThe Youth Wing of MBF noted that the outburst of CNG through its press conference on the killings was the symbol of appalling bigotry that is slowly eating up the soul of the nation.\n\nThrough a statement issued by Nasiru Jagaba, Emmanuel Zopmal and\n\nChris Aba, respectively, the body called on CNG and other groups engaged in playing the script of their masters to stop this deceit of double standards that have become its acceptable ethics.\n\nThe Youth wondered why the CNG, which was silent on intermittent coldblooded murders on the Plateau and other parts of the North would only found its voice when some elements attacked travellers.\n\nThe Youth said it was unfortunate the CNG would quickly address the press on the incident and called for the arrest of Irigwe monarchs in the troubled areas shows that the group is engaged in fanning the embers of violence\n\nThe statement reads; \u201dThe attention of the Youth Wing of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has been drawn to the press conference addressed by a group known as the Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, on the recent attacks on travellers in Jos, Plateau State, last weekend.\n\n\u201dWhile we condemn the attacks and offer our heartfelt sympathies to victims and relations of the dead, we are appalled by CNG\u2019s malevolent attempt at painting the unfortunate incident in religious and ethnic colouration.\n\n\u2018Middle Belt Youths are surprised that despite the intermittent coldblooded murders on the Plateau and other parts of the North, the group only found its voice when some elements attacked travellers.\n\n:\u2019It is on record that not only Plateau State but the entire North has been turned into a river of bloodshed, with hundreds of communities decimated and thousands of innocent citizens killed without a whimper from the group.\n\n\u201dMore worrisome, the deliberate attempt at demonising the Irigwe ethnic nationality as perpetrators of these killings has been orchestrated without any evidence.\n\n\u201dNot only were hundreds of homes reduced into rubble in five Irigwe communities, but no fewer than 76 Irigwe persons were also brutally murdered within a span of four days in the last two weeks without any attempt by the security forces to bring the killers to justice.\n\n\u201dWhile these murderers have been enmeshed in destroying lives, homes and vast swathes of farmlands, the CNG embraced silence and looked the other way.\n\n\u201dThe CNG seems to be available for the highest bidder and only found its voice when the victims of the Saturday attack turned out to be Fulani people.\n\n\u201dThat the CNG would quickly address the press on the incident and called for the arrest of Irigwe monarchs in the troubled areas shows that the group is engaged in fanning the embers of violence.\n\n\u201dAs youths of the Middle belt region, there seems to be a veil over what truly happened in Jos last Saturday.\n\n\u201dIf actually, the travellers were coming from Bauchi, it is incongruous that instead of passing through Bauchi Road; what were their reasons for preferring the Rukuba Road leading to Miango where Irigwe people were engaged in mass burial of their members that were killed?\n\n\u201dThe Youth Wing of the Middle Belt Region calls on relevant security agencies to investigate thoroughly the circumstances surrounding this attack to determine whether one of the vehicles in the convoy was carrying a large cache of arms.\n\n\u201dWe condemn the attempt by the CNG to label the Irigwe ethnic nationality as the perpetrators of these killings as they were deeply involved in the burial of their people killed by heartless herdsmen.\n\n\u201dThe Irigwe people have rightly distanced themselves from the reprehensible and devious act and challenged the police to prove their culpability. It is now the responsibility of the police to me prove the culpability of the Irigwe people.\n\n\u201dWe note with heavy hearts that despite outcries from communities and patriotic Nigerians calling on the Federal Government to halt further genocidal attacks on our communities, our people living in the Middle Belt region have been abandoned by the government and left to the mercy of their attackers.\n\n\u201dWe are shocked that despite the horrifying cynosure of massacre unleashed on the Irigwe people and other ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Zone, the government and relevant security agencies have played the ostrich and refused to deploy genuine efforts at combating these murdering monsters.\n\n\u201dArising from the bland disposition of security agencies in bringing to justice murderers of innocent Nigerians, the Middle Belt Youth Wing calls on CNG and other groups engaged in playing the script of their masters to stop this deceit of double standards that have become its acceptable ethics.\n\n\u201dThe CNG through its press conference is the symbol of appalling bigotry that is slowly eating up the soul of our nation.\n\n\u201dWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to stop applying different standards in resolving the security challenges confronting our nation. The blood that flows in the veins of both Irigwe and Fulani people is still red in colour and represents our common humanity.\n\n\u201dThe Middle Belt Youth Wing calls on security agencies to put members of the CNG under serious security watch as their press conference has the potential of undermining and threatening the peace of not only the North but Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201dWe are quick to call the attention of the government on the continued killings of university students in Jos. Government should do everything to halt further unwarranted attacks on innocent citizens.\n\n\u201dWe further call on the Federal Government to take a closer look at the comments credited to a Sheikh who threatened retaliation in the event the government fails to handle the matter. Government must be just to all sides if it is committed to dealing with insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201dThe Middle Belt Youths are aware that there are plots to subjugate our people and enthrone the Fulani as masters over our people.\n\n\u201dWe shall resist such devious efforts within our constitutional rights. Nigerians must not allow themselves to be deceived by the hypocrisy of the CNG that is famed for its double standards.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He has made a very remarkable impact so that actually impressed me\u201d.\n\n\u201cI used to come to this state when it was barely nothing, and I want to pay tributes to Governor Victor Attah who laid the foundation this state today. We are here today to further cement that relationship, that brotherhood so that we can further take this state to the next level and the country also to the next level. We want to commend your brotherly welcome and hospitality extended to us which we acknowledge Akwa Ibom is at the top\u201d, he said.\n\nAtiku who decried the downward economic situation of the nation, however said, comparatively, Nigeria fared better under the leadership of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) saying.\n\nHear him, \u201cJust compare the economic indices during the PDP and also the APC reign, the growth in GDP and industrialization and other sectors of the economy, we did extremely well and we also promoted the growth of the private sector\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, former Governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu Muazu, described Governor Emmanuel as a silent achiever.\n\nAccording to Muazu, \u201cGovernor Udom Emmanuel has done so well with little noise in Akwa Ibom State, and has also succeeded in taming those that do not know that their tenure ends in eight years. He is one of the few with the ability to ensure that our party the PDP remains united\u201d.\n\nReceiving the guests, Governor Udom Emmanuel welcomed the former Vice President and his entourage to Akwa Ibom State, describing him as a detribalized leader who is committed towards the growth and progress of the nation.\n\n\u2019You are someone that we admire, today if you check the leaders of this country there are few leaders like you who are highly detribalized\u201d, he noted.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel stated that Akwa Ibom though richly endowed with mineral resources has not been given a fair share of its resources, lamenting the deprivation of the state evident in the near absence of federal government projects.\n\nIn his words, \u201cYou are one of the leaders I believe if God had given you an opportunity earlier than now, probably, Akwa Ibom wouldn\u2019t have been where we are now, we have been badly cheated. A state that sits on 36.5% oil and gas reserves of this nation let them tell you what the federal government\u2019s presence is, every single dual-carriage way you drive here is done by the state government, every single structure you see in the state outside the Police they posted to me they have not given me anything.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have a depot to store downstream petroleum product, I am developing one of the smartest and modern airport development in this continent, the simplest appreciation I would have gotten from the federal government would have been to give me a fuel Jet A1 dump as an Oil and Gas producing state\u201d.\n\nHe thanked the team for commending his strides in the state, and restated that he is committed to making life meaningful to people in the state through efficient management of the resources accrued.",

          "title": "Nigerian Army denies enlisting former terrorists into the Force",
          "text": "By Kingsley Omonobi\n\nThe Nigerian Army on Tuesday night denied recruiting former Boko Haram Terrorists who have surrendered and had gone through de-radicalization and rehabilitation saying the claims are baseless and a figment of imagination of its authors.\n\nThis is just as the Army headquarters also denied what it described as blackmail alleging that troop\u2019s in the South East are aiding and abetting Criminal elements from a certain part of the country.\n\nA statement by Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, Director, Army Public Relations said, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to an online video making rounds in the social media by one Young Elder and produced by Anthony Jay.\n\n\u201cIn the video, the so called Young Elder attempted to draw conclusion from the collapse of the Afghan military and trying very hard to relate it to the ongoing surrender by the Boko Haram/ Islamic State West Africa Province Terrorists in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Young Elder in a comic way tried to express worries about the surrendered terrorists.\n\n\u201cWhile it is understood that the situation in Afghanistan calls for concerns by any right thinking person or organisation, the manner in which the comic Young Elder presented it shows his lack of basic knowledge on the subject he hurriedly delved into.\n\n\u201cThe amateurish production conjured some unfounded and baseless claims that only exist in the figment of their imagination, claiming that surrendered terrorists where going to be absorbed into the Nigerian Army (NA).\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the NA does not have any repentant terrorists joining its ranks and does not have any plan for that.\n\n\u201cThere are teaming able-bodied Nigerians that are willing to join the NA and genuinely help in the fight against terrorism and other violent crimes.\n\n\u201cThe NA therefore is not desperate for prospective recruits to stoop so low and engage the services of former terrorists.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, it is not even recommended to absorb former fighters into the services of a regular military.\n\n\u201cThe NA wish to state that the campaign of falsehood embarked upon by some individuals who do not wish the nation well cannot distract its personnel from their resolve to bring an end to the violent crimes in the country.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate that the NA under the leadership of the Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya will continue to operate within the dictates of the law.\n\n\u201cSurrendered terrorists will be received, processed and passed to the appropriate Government agencies that are saddled with the responsibility of handling them.\n\n\u201cWhile we recommend that matters related to security be left with those who have the requisite expertise and experience, we wish to remind comic characters like Young Elder to focus on contributing towards nation building and not engaging in campaign of falsehood.\n\nSimilarly, it said, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a spurious allegation by an assembly member representing Isuikwuato constituency of Abia State who alleged that when security agents arrested suspected kidnappers of Abia State University lecturers, a certain call came from a high military formation ordering the release of the arrested suspects despite strong evidence linking them with the said crime.\n\n\u201cMuch as we do not want to join issues with the insinuators, it is is crucial to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cIf truly the claims in the said report emanated from the lawmaker, then we must state without mincing words that they are not only unfounded but a travesty of facts and reality.\n\n\u201cThe claim is completely devoid of truth. It is most unfair for anyone at that height of the social ladder to sponsor a smear campaign against the Nigerian Army for whatever reason; particularly knowing that he has access to the leadership of the military.\n\n\u201cContrary to the narrative being peddled in the said report, it took the gallantry of our men on patrol to rescue the victims of the said kidnap incident before handing them over to the police.\n\n\u201cHow then could the same Army that was instrumental to the rescue of the victims, turn around to order the release of the suspects. Evidently, this is illogical and a blatant lie.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army therefore, wishes to state that the misguided report is actually an abysmally failed attempt at blackmailing the NA for denying unscrupulous elements the freedom of action to foist lawlessness and violence on the good people and government of Abia state.\n\n\u201cThe Hon. lawmaker should have abinitio, sought clarifications from the Army before resorting to media trial.\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to members of the public to approach the Army on any issue requiring clarification rather than resorting to blackmail.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Army is firmly committed to the fight against banditry and criminality in the country. Nigerians, including residents of Abia state are assured of their security as we relentlessly continue to discharge our constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Ugwuanyi made the announcement when he addressed a delegation from JOHESU comprising members of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Nigeria Union of Allied Health Professionals (NUAHP) and Medical and Health Workers Sector Union of Nigeria (MHWUN), at the Government House, Enugu.\n\nMembers of JOHESU were at the Government House, Enugu, on a Thank-you visit to Gov. Ugwuanyi for his benevolence and unflinching commitment to the welfare of health workers in the state.\n\nPresenting their address, the State Chairman of JOHESU, Comrade Ezekiel Omeh, told Gov. Ugwuanyi that \u201cwe are very grateful to the Almighty God who has chosen you, Your Excellency, to actualize the implementation of Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) for the health professionals and workers in Enugu State\u201d.\n\nComrade Omeh disclosed that \u201cCONHESS is a dream that has eluded us for the past 11 years but made real by you (Ugwuanyi) in the month of May 2021\u201d, adding: \u201cWe thank you and salute your political wisdom to be used as a vessel to actualize God\u2019s will. We appreciate your kind heart and show of love\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further the JOHESU Chairman said: \u201cYour Excellency, we are happy that today, you have placed us at par with our peers and contemporaries in the health industry who have been enjoying the CONHESS which is the appropriate Salary Scale operational in the Country since 2010.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that in the previous times before your coming in as Governor, the Economy was good enough to implement CONHESS for us but our agitations for it then resulted in giving us more pains than relief.\n\n\u201cTo assuage the situation, Your Excellency (Ugwuanyi) approved 10 percent CONHESS in 2018 and in 2021, you approved additional 31 percent making a total of 41 percent CONHESS.\n\n\u201cYou also gave us COVID-19 allowance that lasted for upward of one year when other states, including Federal Government, had withdrawn the payment.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate your aggressive investment in the health sector in Enugu State. To mention a few, we are impressed and grateful for the transformation of Poly Clinic Asata to General Hospital, Uwani Health Centre to a General Hospital, renovation and reconstruction of Udi General Hospital, Awgu General Hospital and School of Midwifery, Awgu, reconstruction and renovation of Nsukka General Hospital, Enugu-Ezike General Hospital, the phenomenal progress in construction of permanent site of ESUT Teaching Hospital at Igbo-Eno and building of new General Hospitals in different Local Governments in the state that are ready for commissioning.\n\n\u201cThese and other people-oriented projects are simultaneously going on in the state, all for the betterment of the health and welfare of the citizens despite the escalating harsh economic conditions and social unrest in the country.\n\n\u201cYou have demonstrated how democratic government can be run with full participation of the citizenry, including workers. Hence our ability to get CONHESS approved and implemented Minimum Wage and its adjustment, COVID-19 allowance, 13th Month Salary all through dialogue and your show of understanding, transparency and prioritization of the welfare of workers and citizens.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your responsiveness to the yearnings of the people especially workers. Your disposition to govern Enugu State with the fear of God and Rule of Law has turned the state to be the most relatively peaceful state in the country and South East in particular.\n\nIn their remarks, the State Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC), Comrade Virginus Nwobodo and Comrade Benneth Asogwa respectively, endorsed the address by the leadership of JOHESU, stressing that the workers of Enugu State deeply appreciate all that Gov. Ugwuanyi is doing for the people of the state \u201cin this time of scarcity and economic meltdown\u201d.\n\nThey added that it was only during the administration of Gov. Ugwuanyi that the workers of Enugu State visit the Government House without carrying placards in protest, saying that \u201cwe are in Government House today to register our appreciation\u201d.",

          "text": "There was confusion on Tuesday as the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) split into two factions.\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, leads one faction while the Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif, has taken charge of the other.\n\nAkinwonmi and Nazif are laying claim to the position of the National Chairman, to fill the leadership gap created by the suspension of the substantive National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nA court in Port Harcourt had on Monday, issued an order restraining Secondus from parading himself as PDP National Chairman and taking part in any activity of the party while the order lasts.\n\nAkinwonmi announced his assumption of office as Secondus\u2019 replacement pending the determination of the restraining order slammed him by the court on Tuesday.\n\nThe three-paragraph statement reads: \u201cSection 45(2) (b) of the constitution of the People\u2019s Democratic Party empowers me to summon and preside over party meetings in the absence of the national chairman.\n\n\u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening to a court order which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as Deputy National Chairman (South) of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, after the consultations and in exercise of the aforesaid powers, hereby deem it fit and proper to postpone the National Working Committee meeting earlier scheduled for today until further notice to allow for broader consultations in the overall interest of our party\u201d.\n\nAs soon as the statement hit the media space, the Nazif faction hurriedly summoned a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) with about seven of the 18-member NWC in attendance.\n\nIt was at the meeting, held at the NWC hall at the party secretariat that Nazif pronounced himself the National Chairman, stressing that Akinwonmi, who has been battling a protracted stroke related ailment, was incapacitated and as such, could not perform the duties of national chairman.\n\nAccording to him, Akinwonmi has not been attending NWC meetings and other party functions in the last nine to 10 months.\n\nNazif sustained his argument with Section 47 (4) of the PDP Constitution.\n\nThe Section states: \u201cIn the absence of the National Chairman and the Deputy National Chairman from the region part of the country where the National Chairman originates from, the other Deputy National Chairman shall act as National Chairman without prejudice to 47 (6) of this Constitution\u201d.\n\nDeclaring himself the chairman, Nazif said: \u201cOn this note, distinguished NWC members, I hereby take full charge of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as Chairman in an acting capacity\u201d.\n\nElaborating on Elder Akinwonmi\u2019s indisposition, Nazif said: \u201cWe have waited this morning for the Deputy National Chairman (South) who has been incapacitated, who has not been attending NWC meeting in the last nine months and I believe there was a communication between the deputy national chairmen (south).\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Nazif announced that the much awaited National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting will hold on Friday, August 27, 2021 by 10am.\n\nHe added that the meeting would deliberate on matters affecting the party.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cLike you know, in the absence of the deputy chairman south, I take full charge, so I am hereby calling for an emergency NEC meeting on the 27th August, 2021, 10 am prompt to deliberate on matters affecting the party.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe all the leaders of this party, the owners of this party, that will be in attendance are our governors, former presiding officers will be part of the NEC meeting to deliberate all pending issues\u201d.\n\nAkinwonmi had announced the suspension of the NWC meeting until further notice, a decision Nazif overruled.\n\nGoing by the party\u2019s constitution, Akinwonmi, being from the same South as Secondus, is naturally the next in the line of succession to the chairmanship seat.\n\nHowever, Nazif has cashed in on his ill health to assume the position.\n\nFielding questions from journalists shortly after the NWC meeting that he presided over, Nazif said: \u201cLet me make this very clear that this meeting was called for 2 pm.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the Deputy National Chairman (South) has been incapacitated and did not attend any meeting in the last nine to 10 months as far as NWC is concern.\n\n\u201cHe (Akinwonmi) has not been in communication with any member of the NWC for the last 10 months. And like I said, this party must continue its process.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am not available, someone else will take over. If the national chairman is not available, someone will take over. If the deputy national chairman south is not available, the deputy chairman north will take charge.\n\n\u201cThis is the resolution that was passed by the expanded caucus. And this was the resolution passed by the NWC in our last meeting and we all agreed that there will be a meeting today.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was supposed to be presided over by the National Chairman. Unfortunately, the court order came from a competent court and stopped the chairman from acting as chairman of the party\u201d.\n\nThe leadership crisis in the party appeared to have defied solutions despite several conciliatory moves and concessions initiated by key stakeholders to douse the rising tension.\n\nThe crisis, which reared its head a few months ago, has continued to linger with disruptive effects on the activities of the party.\n\nThe crisis was ignited by moves by some forces in the party to remove Secondus from office.\n\nThe anti Secondus campaign is believed to have been instigated by the Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nAkinwonmi is in Secondus\u2019 camp while Nazif is championing Wike\u2019s cause.\n\nThe perception in Wike\u2019s camp is that the resolution reached by all the critical organs of the party on August 10 to have the PDP national convention brought forward from December to October, to pave way for the election of new NWC members is being resisted by Secondus.\n\nSecondus had, before the Monday court order that suspended him from office, continued to argue that the proposed October date for the national convention was not feasible.\n\nHe had cited pending ward, local and state congresses in no fewer than seven states, a development he said, could attract litigation from the affected states if not concluded.\n\nThe ensuing litigation, he had argued, could lead to the frustration or invalidation of the outcome of the convention.\n\nBut the Wike camp has rejected Secondus\u2019 argument, saying that it was a ploy for him to stay put in office.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Molly Kilete, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Sunday Ani\n\nThe attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna by bandits in the early hours of yesterday, which led to the death of two officers and abduction of a Major, has sparked outrage and tension across the country.\n\nThe bandits reportedly entered the NDA premises disguised in military uniforms and passed through the security gate into the academy officers quarters and started shooting sporadically.\n\nThe Academy spokesman, Major Bashir Muhammad Jajira, in a statement said: \u201cThe security architecture of the Nigerian Defence Academy was compromised early this morning by unknown gunmen who gained access into the residential area within the Academy in Afaka. During the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\u201d\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Iraboh, who has been on tour of the North East was said to have made a stopover at the NDA, yesterday. Iraboh, who arrived the academy at about past 5pm was taken round the academy by its commandant, Major General Yusuf and other officials to have a first hand information on what really happened.\n\nSecurity has been beefed up in and around the academy just as the Academy in collaboration with the 1Division Nigerian Army, Air Training Command and other security agencies have begun pursuit of the gunmen with a view to tracking them and rescuing the abducted personnel.\n\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed report said the abductors have contacted the NDA demanding N200 million ransom.\n\nPiqued by the development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the citizens has lost hope in the ability of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to combat terrorism.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, it said security situation has deteriorated so much that suspected bandits now attack military formations.\n\n\u201cBandits and terrorists are now freely ravaging our communities in Kano, Kaduna, Kogi, Benue, Zamfara, Adamwa, Taraba, Borno, Yobe, Imo and other states of the federation, including Mr. President\u2019s home state, Katsina, where the governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has now asked victims of terror attacks to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is distressing that having lost hope in the capacity and commitment of the President Buhari-led APC administration to protect their citizens, state governments are now sending vehicles to the University of Jos, Plateau state, to evacuate their citizens,\u201d PDP said.\n\nThis is as the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) through its Senior Elders\u2019 Forum, raised the alarm that bandits may overrun Aso Rock, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power in Abuja, if proactive steps are not taken to safeguard the Presidential Villa and the entire country, while the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) expressed regret that the nation\u2019s security system was operating on reverse gear. The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) described the attack as a national calamity as it showed that bandits were becoming superior to the military.\n\nFormer national president of YCE, Dansaaki Samuel Agbede, who spoke with journalists in Ibadan, Oyo State, said the invasion was unprecedented in the history of the Nigerian military.\n\nAgbede, retired colonel of the Nigerian Army, stated that the attack signified that \u201cchicken is coming home to roost. All our calls and cries for proactive actions against insecurity have been confirmed by this worrisome invasion. It is very worrisome that bandits could have the audacity to attack military academy and kill officers. This has never happened in the history of the military that bandits could have the effrontery to attack military academy.\n\n\u201cThis is too disgraceful and it is just confirming what we have been saying about the fifth columnist. We have seen why we should not allow those Boko Haram insurgents into the military. It is like putting fire on our thatched roof.\n\n\u201cIt is time to look up and gather elders together to do something about this issue. It is dangerous to leave governance of 200 million people in the hands of one man. To say that we have a Major-General as our Commander-in-Chief and this is happening is worrisome.\n\n\u201cJust like we have been crying, these bandits are everywhere. We should stop dancing around for politics. It is disgusting. We really have problems and we should not wait until they overrun Aso Rock. We still appeal to the Federal Government to gather people together to address this issue.\u201d\n\nReacting, spokesman of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, said in a statement that the incident was an embarrassment to first generation of northerners who fought hard to bring development to the north.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF have said it again and again that there is everything seriously wrong with management of our security. The other day, a Nigerian Airforce fighter aircraft was shot down by the so-called bandits. Today, the factory where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated. What else do we need to show that our national security system is running on reverse gear?\n\n\u201cThe latest security breach is another embarrassment to the ACF. The NDA is a proud monument of the efforts of the first generation of northerners who fought hard to bring development to the north; the likes of Muhammadu Ribadu, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Sir Ahmadu Bello who brought the institution to Kaduna. They did not bring it here for our generation to hand it over to bandits or whatever we call them.\n\n\u201cThis is an institution that is not only a pride of the north but a pride of Nigeria. Many African countries train their military officers here. It is really sad that ordinary street bandits will invade a military institution of such high national and international repute, outwit the security system and men there, kill officers and take one away to an unknown destination.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF are particularly sad because Kaduna is our home not only because our headquarters is located here, but for a long time, even after the split of our Northern region, Kaduna remained home to all northerners. The NDA is a proud reminder of the achievements of our fathers. Is that how our present generation of northerners will seat and watch as these legacies are destroyed?\n\nSpeaking through its national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonna, Ohanaeze Ndigbo described the country\u2019s security as scaring to any average Nigeria and called on the government to sit up because the development is threat to the corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a national calamity for this kind of attack to happen to the nation\u2019s defence academy because the armed forces are the symbol of national unity and last line of the country\u2019s defence,\u201d he said.\n\nFor MBF, the fact that the Air Force has not been allowed to bomb the bandits and mop up their bases means there is complicity on the part of the government.\n\n\u201cGovernment has to come clean because it is getting worrisome. If the government will allow the bandits to get this far, it means that something is wrong somewhere. To attack a defence academy where military offices are being trained is going too far. Government has to rise up and bomb the bandits out of existence,\u201d national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonna, submitted.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, said the development is shocking and disturbing.\n\nAfenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the NDA is the heart of Nigeria\u2019s military and should elicit fear in the hearts of criminals.\n\nAjayi, who spoke on behalf of the group\u2019s leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said for the attack to happen few days after President Muhammadu Buhari had a meeting with his security chiefs was an indictment on the security architecture.",
          "summary": "The bandits reportedly entered the NDA premises disguised in military uniforms and passed through the security gate into the academy officers quarters and started shooting sporadically.\nIt is very worrisome that bandits could have the audacity to attack military academy and kill officers.\nThis has never happened in the history of the military that bandits could have the effrontery to attack military academy.\nToday, the factory where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated.\nWhat else do we need to show that our national security system is running on reverse gear?",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\ncrisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) assumed a new twist, yesterday, as the Deputy National Chairman ( South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi and the Deputy National Chairman (North), Suleiman Nazif, laid claim to the leadership of the opposition party.\n\nA Degema High Court, in Rivers State, had on Monday, restrained the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, from parading himself as national chairman, pending determination of the substantive suit.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections and run-up to the PDP National Convention, power blocs in the opposition party had been at daggers drawn over the control of party structure.\n\nThe crisis blew open three weeks ago as a major crack emerged in the National Working Committee (NWC) with six of the members calling for the immediate resignation of Secondus.\n\nHowever, after a meeting of stakeholders, including PDP governors, members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) and members of the National Assembly, it was resolved that the party\u2019s convention, earlier scheduled for December hold in October.\n\nIt was also resolved that Secondus should convene a NEC meeting to set up convention and zoning committees. Nevertheless, Daily Sun gathered that NWC at its meeting, last Wednesday, could not agree on convening the NEC immediately, as resolved by the stakeholders.\n\nIn the aftermath of the court order restraining Secondus from functioning as party chairman, Akinwonmi, in a statement, yesterday, said he had taken over the affairs of the party in line with Section 35(3) (b) of the PDP constitution, 2017. Consequently, he announced indefinite suspension of the NWC meeting earlier scheduled for yesterday.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cSection 35(3) (b) of the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party empowers me to summon and preside over party meetings in the absence of the national chairman.\n\n\u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening to a court order which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party, after the consultations and in exercise of the aforesaid powers, hereby deem it fit and prosper to postpone the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting earlier scheduled for today until further notice to allow for broader consultations in the overall interest of our party.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a twist, Nazif and some NWC members stormed the party\u2019s secretariat at about 2.30pm for a meeting.\n\nThe party officials were escorted by a team of mobile policemen, civil defence operatives and plain clothed security operatives. Immediately, the anti-Secondus NWC members commenced the meeting, the escorts took over the security arrangement around the venue.\n\nNazif explained that Section 35(3)(d) of the PDP Constitution (2017) empowers him to take over the affairs of the party in acting capacity, in the absence of the national chairman and deputy national chairman (South).\n\nThe NWC members at the meeting were the PDP national secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri; national auditor, Adamu Mustapha; national vice chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih; his South-East counterpart, Ali Odefa; national vice-chairman, South-West, Toafeek Arapaja and national youth leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye.\n\nAccording to him, the NWC was in receipt of the court order restraining Secondus from parading himself as PDP and has complied.\n\nHowever, Akinwonmi insisted he was the authentic acting national chairman of the party and declared Nazif\u2019s decisions null and void.\n\nAkinwonmi, who was accompanied by the national secretary, Ibrahim Tsauri, said every decision taken by the Nazif group, was null and void.\n\n\u201cI am a man of peace, not a man of crisis. PDP has a good succession order. There is order here. The chairman is followed by the deputy national chairman 1 (South), followed by the deputy national chairman (north).\n\n\u201cEverything conducted here while I was not here is null and void. At the appropriate time, we will call on a meeting of NEC, BoT and we will meet here.\n\n\u201cI appeal to party loyalists, when a father is dead, another father will come. I did not play a part in the death of the former one.\u201d\n\nAkinwonmi, while reacting to the allegation that he was incapacitated, admitted that he was sick for some months but was getting back on his feet.\n\n\u201cSickness is not a friend of anybody. I was on my way to Wadata Plaza when I had stroke in my car. I was at the Cedacrest hospital for three months. Anybody can be sick but I am getting back and better. It was not my making to be sick. In the past, I could not stand up but I stop up singing the national anthem here this afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for people to start making reference to my ill health. Anybody can be sick but I am getting better now.\u201d\n\nTsauri, who was one of those, who attended the NWC meeting presided over by Nazif, earlier in the day, said there was no division the opposition party.\n\n\u201cWe are here to adopt the doctrine of necessity. PDP is a law abiding party, with people of integrity and respect.\n\n\u201cYesterday( Monday), we were faced with something very challenging; which we never expected. We have no other option but to accept the order if the court. There are lawyers that took this matter to court. We have given the judgement to the lawyers to study.\n\n\u201cThe meeting that was held this afternoon happened because the constitution says if the national vice chairman 1 is not around, the national vice chairman 2 should take over. The crisis that brought all this started here, it is here and it will end here. We shall be prepared for NEC and convention. NEC will decide when the convention will hold.\u201d",

Some are teenagers, below the ages of 11, 12, who can handle AK-47 and there\u2019s one very important thing that Nigerians need to understand; if this issue of Boko Haram, insurgency, is not resolved, I believe it will never end because it is a generation. Those that came out from the bush you can see one person has two wives, three wives in the bush, he\u2019s having 10 children. These children are well trained to behave in such manner.\u201d\n\nZulum, who said he had been attacked by insurgents about 50 times, also promised to support victims of insurgency, especially those whose parents were killed.\n\nHe expressed support for ongoing surrendering by insurgents, saying it was in the best interest of peace and a way to eventually bring the protracted insurgency to an end.\n\n\u201cIn the last 12 years thousands of lives were lost, people have completely lost their means of livelihood. We have a total number of over 50,000 orphans and widows, these are official figures, the unofficial figures are more than this, and we were able to cultivate not more than three percent of our total arable land because of the insurgency and right now, the whereabouts of not less than 10 per cent of people of Borno State is not known to all of us at all. This is a very serious matter and I think the report of the surrendering of the insurgents, to me in particular and to the greater people of Borno State, is a very welcomed development. Unless we want to continue with an endless war, I see no reason why we shall reject those that are willing to surrender.\u201d",

          "title": "PDP Crisis Worsens as Court Restrains Secondus from Parading as Chairman",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nEfforts by elders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to quell the leadership crisis might have come to naught as a High Court of Rivers State yesterday issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, has been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nBut the embattled chairman of the main opposition party has said if he and the party were taken to court, they would defend themselves.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, in the suit marked PHC/2183/CS/2021 were Ibeawuchi Alex, Dennis Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen and Umezirike Onucha, while Secondus and PDP were the first and second respondents, respectively.\n\nMr. H. A. Bello, who argued the exparte application on behalf of the plaintiffs, urged the court to grant the reliefs sought by his clients in the interest of justice, even as he sought an order of court directing that the matter be heard during the court\u2019s vacation owing to the urgent nature of the case.\n\nPart of the prayers were that Secondus be stopped from performing the functions of national chairman of the PDP while on suspension as a member of the party.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Gbasam granted the reliefs requested by the applicants and issued an order, \u201crestraining the 1st defendant from parading himself as a member of the 2nd defendant or National Chairman of the 2nd defendant or performing the functions of National Chairman of the 2nd defendant or calling, attending or presiding over any meeting of the 2nd defendant or any committee of the 2nd defendant at ward, local government or state level.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked to stay away from \u201ccalling for any ward, local government or state congresses of the second defendant or setting up committee for such congresses, or participating in any activity of the 2nd defendant whatsoever, while on suspension as a member of the 2nd defendant, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\u201d\n\nJustice Gbasam, in addition, ordered that the restraining order and all other orders as well as originating summons and motion on notice be served on Secondus by substituted means.\n\nAccording to the ruling, the order and all other court\u2019s documents were to be pasted on the gate of the residence of Secondus at number 1, William Jombo street, old GRA, Port Harcourt, Rivers State as well as published in a national newspaper.\n\nThe court processes once pasted at Secondus\u2019 residence and published in a national daily, the court held, was deemed to have been properly served on him.\n\nThe latest court action against Secondus might not be unconnected to the failure of his National Working Committee (NWC) to conduct a NEC meeting recently directed by the expanded Board of Trustees (BoT) meeting of the PDP.\n\nThe BOT, at a recent meeting to resolve the face-off between Secondus and some aggrieved leaders of the PDP, particularly the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, decided that Secondus should continue in office and that a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting be summoned to constitute the members of the National Convention of the party slated for the end of October,2021.\n\nThough the NWC had immediately advanced reasons why the NEC could not hold, the resort to litigations was not foreseen.\n\nBefore the extended meeting of the BoT, there were two opposing groups: those plotting the removal of the NWC led by Secondus and those, who wanted him retained till the end of his tenure in December 2021. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the expected implosion in the party, due to the intractable leadership crisis.\n\nHitherto, the PDP was in serious crisis following the defection of three governors \u2013 David Umahi of Ebonyi State; Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State \u2013 and members of the National Assembly, who were elected on its platform. They all defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe mood dampening situation in the party was becoming worrisome as the PDP had lost 17 senators. The membership of the party in the House of Representatives had also diminished. Thus, some members believed the best way to resolve the crisis was by sacking the Secondus-led NWC.\n\nThe crisis, however, took a twist for the worst, when seven national deputies resigned in one day. Those who resigned were the Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nThe resignation had ruffled feathers of the NWC, and was like a joke taken too far, as it triggered several reactions from stakeholders. First, was the PDP governors\u2019 forum through its chairman, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto State, who summoned a meeting of his colleagues to resolve the crisis.\n\nIn line with series of meetings and a determination to resolve the crisis to save PDP, Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jubrin, summoned an expanded board meeting.\n\nThe perception in some quarters was that the new wave of crisis that has engulfed the PDP might not be unconnected to speculations that Secondus, might seek a second term at the national convention coming up in December. But some stakeholders, including Wike \u2013 Secondus\u2019 governor \u2013 were not comfortable with that.\n\nIn the long run, BoT chairman, Walid Jibrin, identified numerous problems in the PDP, which needed urgent attention.\n\nThey included lack of cohesion within and among major stakeholders that needed the intervention of the BoT as the highest advisory body of the party.\n\nJibrin urged his compatriots in the PDP to seize the moment, but this must begin with the PDP putting its house in order, by starting the right preparation for the impending elective convention to elect PDP\u2019s national leaders, that would lead the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nHe warned that the anticipated success of the PDP at the polls must not be sacrificed on the altar of personal interest and unnecessary in-house fighting, aimed at killing the objectives set by the party, noting also that PDP ruled for 16 years as against the total failure of the current government, which he claimed was characterised by incompetence and total insecurity.\n\nJibrin\u2019s line of thought aligned with other stakeholders and members of the BoT. It was a masterstroke that eventually dictated the terms of engagement at the meeting.\n\nBefore the meeting, a statement by Senator David B. Mark, Prof. Jerry Gana, Dr. Iyochia Ayu, Alhaji Sule Lamido, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senator Ayim Pius Ayim, Senator Ibrahim Mantu, Senator Adolphus Wabara, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, Dr. Ibrahim H. Dankwambo, Senator Helen Esuene, Hajiya Zainab Maina, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Hon. Austin Okpara, Senator Biodun Olujimi, Senator Zainab Kure,Senator Agboola Hosea, Senator Odion Ugbesia, Chief Mike Ogiadomhe, and Hajiya Hadiza Adodo, had appealed for calm while the crisis was being addressed.\n\nBy these interventions, the plot to move against Secondus and members of the NWC was defeated, even before the meeting commenced.\n\nIn taking that crucial step towards a resolution, the BoT members, NEC and other PDP stakeholders, erected a bridge over the troubled waters.\n\nUnfortunately, some stakeholders within the PDP had taken a hardline position already and it was only a matter of time before the boiling cauldron of repressed anger brimmed over with naked emotions.\n\nOne of the immediate steps taken by the BoT was to urgently meet with PDP governors, the NWC and other critical stakeholders.\n\nCuriously, those who wanted Secondus to stay in office till the end of his term, argued that it would leave a sour taste if Secondus was unceremoniously booted out of office. But his opponents left him with one foot of opportunity in the doorway. They wanted him to publicly renounce a second term ambition.\n\nTo enforce this position was a group led by Wike. This, sadly, underscored how much Secondus\u2019 ouster meant to the Rivers governor, hence he attended the BoT meeting for the first time.\n\nWith Jibril\u2019s agenda, which insisted that the meeting was crucial to the party\u2019s survival in 2023, it was clear that the meeting was not going to fulfil the agenda of the anti-Secondus elements.\n\nGiven the opportunity, a visibly relieved Secondus thanked the BoT for its intervention and an opportunity to live another day. He commended the party\u2019s reconciliation committee led by a former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, stating also how he tried to resolve the issue of the resigning deputies in the NWC.\n\nHe noted that the party\u2019s internal conflict resolution mechanism was quickly deployed so that the issues were not escalated to the point that the party would be greatly damaged.\n\nThe meeting ended after over four hours. The thrust of discussion was given fillip and made public by Senator David Mark, who said the meeting had resolved to set up a committee made up of the governors, members of the BoT, members of the National Assembly, all the members of the NWC, former governors, former ministers, so that they could holistically resolve the problems.\n\nA pointer to the fact that the crisis was about to be resolved was when the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Diran Odeyemi, one of the officers that tendered their resignation, withdrew his resignation from office and vowed to work with the Secondus-led NWC to ensure a successful national convention, which would usher in new national officers.\n\nOdeyemi said in a letter dated August 4, 2021, that his decision to withdraw his resignation was taken in view of the activation of the internal method of resolving issues by leaders of the PDP across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\nBut Secondus\u2019 media office, while reacting to the development, has said, \u201cIf Secondus and the party are taken to court, they will defend themselves.\u201d\n\nThe office of the National Chairman of PDP was reacting to calls from media houses on a press statement sent to newsrooms by one Kelvin Ebiri, Special Assistant Media to Wike announcing that, a court had restrained Secondus from parading himself as national chairman and member of PDP.\n\nThe media office, in a statement by Ike Abonye, said, \u201cPDP and Secondus are not afraid of court. It\u2019s disheartening that the interim order of court used in removing the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen unilaterally in January, 2019 for which PDP vehemently condemned is resurrecting again from Port Harcourt.\n\nThis party is a child of history, owned by Nigerians, bigger than any individual or group including desperadoes.\u201d\n\nHowever, from all indications, it\u2019s not yet uhuru for the PDP, until after all the meetings and the coast is completely clear. Until then, the jury is still out.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to review grazing reserves across the country is unconstitutional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Benue governor said it is worrying that while most states have agreed that ranching is a better way to resolve insecurity, the president has maintained his position on open grazing.\n\nThis statement comes following Buhari\u2019s approval of the recommendations of a committee to review 368 grazing reserves across 25 states in the country \u2014 a development that has been met with criticism.\n\nFemi Falana, human rights lawyer, had criticised Buhari for the decision, adding that open grazing is \u201cobsolete\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the development when he featured on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Tuesday, Ortom described the president\u2019s decision on grazing reserves as \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the presidency. One would expect that we\u2019re in a democratic governance and the presidency would have understood this,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cSome weeks ago, Mr. President challenged Nigerians on whether he is not ruling this country according to the rule of law. And I came out and I said \u2018Mr. President, if some people are deceiving you, let me tell you the facts on ground. You\u2019re not ruling this country according to the rule of law in some aspects\u2019. And here we are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDoes Mr. President not have an attorney-general to advise him on what the law says about land administration? There is a land use act enshrined in the Constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and it amazes me for Mr. President to say that he will revive obsolete grazing reserves and grazing routes.\n\n\u201cI have had personal conversations with Mr President and his handlers. I have said \u2018Look, when we had grazing routes and grazing reserves, what was the total population? Less than 40 million. This was when it was initiated and then it was as a result of the laws governing northern Nigeria. Today, we are over 200 million people. How do you expect the same thing?\u2019 The land hasn\u2019t increased, and now, it\u2019s even less because of the ceding of Bakassi to Cameroon. Now, in 2021, you\u2019re talking about open grazing.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to achieve this? If Mr. President respects the law, the land use act gives governors the power to preside over land administration on behalf of the people. So, it is amazing and I am surprised to hear this coming from Mr President as if he doesn\u2019t have an attorney-general or lawyers around him to advise him.\n\n\u201cI think Mr President was misquoted or he did it out of error. He should come out to apologise to Nigerians. There is no basis whatsoever for this to be going on when we have the Constitution.\u201d",

In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Bitnob to launch a free, 10-second remittance transfer service for Africans via Bitcoin Lightning Network",
          "text": "Last week, Jack Mallers, the founder and CEO of Zap Solutions and Strike, a bitcoin payments company, posted a video showing a free and super instant (within 10 seconds) transfer of $10 from his U.S. bank account to the Bitnob account of Bernard Parah.\n\nFor many, the transaction may appear like any other financial payment on a fintech app. But the Bitcoin Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob is a system that could upend the global remittance market and threatens the very existence of legacy players.\n\nHow does the super-fast global money transfer technology work? TechCabal caught up with Bitnob CEO, Bernard, to find out.\n\nWith @Bitnob_official's Lightning Network integration, we now have free, instant, non-reversible remittances of any size to and from the United States, Nigeria, and Ghana.\n\n\n\n$10 in my US bank account became spendable NGN for @bernard_parah in seconds.\n\n\n\nMonetary history. pic.twitter.com/UXTf70qkpR \u2014 Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) August 19, 2021\n\nMichael: How did you get involved in Bitcoin and what was your work experience before cryptocurrency?\n\nBernard: I first learned about Bitcoin in school. There wasn\u2019t a lot of prior professional work before then. I had dropped out of the University of Abuja sometime in 2011 and in 2013, I moved to Ghana to study computer science. It was during this time, around October in my first year in school, that I got to know about Bitcoin.\n\nAs a student, I got a lot of freelance gigs and contract jobs with companies. So after my first year in school, I spent most of my spare time just coding and building things for companies in Ghana and around the world. I had a professional life that started in school and spent most of my time working than going to lectures. I only read seriously when it was a few weeks before exams.\n\nAt the time, I worked for the biggest PR agency in Ghana back then, Global Media Alliance, on a couple of platforms for influencer marketing. I worked for companies in the U.S. and Canada as well. I also ran technical stuff for a number of digital marketing agencies, which gave me a blend of marketing and software engineering.\n\nI got back to Nigeria sometime in 2018 and started some work with my current co-founders while consulting for companies in Nigeria and abroad. It was mostly freelance and consulting before starting Bitnob in 2020.\n\nMichael: So what led to the founding of Bitnob?\n\nBernard: I have a personal story with Bitcoin. In 2016, there was a CBN ban on the use of naira cards abroad. I had money in my bank account but couldn\u2019t withdraw it in Ghana. The only way was to get someone who sent me Bitcoin and I exchanged that for Cedis. That event was a turning point \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe someone would give an order and my money was gone. Bitcoin made a lot more sense to me. It was money that could easily cross borders and I can always find someone in any country I\u2019m in who\u2019s willing to take my Bitcoin for cash. So it changed my perspective and I decided to dive deeper into Bitcoin.\n\nSometime in 2017, I quit my full-time job to fully focus on the space and then founded Bitnob with a colleague. We initially did over-the-counter transactions for people who wanted to buy large amounts of Bitcoin \u2013 $50,000, $100,000. We were the guys who could get it for you. Such amounts were not easy to come by on online platforms so we had to move around the streets of Accra, find people who had Bitcoin, gather them for sale. Then I realised this was going to be useful for a lot of people in the future and decided to build a career in this space.\n\nRight now, we do more than just broker. Bitnob allows people to save and invest in Bitcoin and the whole process is automated. Instead of wondering when should you buy or sell Bitcoin, the app eliminates takes care of that using the dollar cost averaging technique. You can automate your savings to say, for instance, buy $10 worth of Bitcoin every week. Bitnob will handle the rest. We also offer loan services. If you have Bitcoin, we take that as collateral and give you a loan in naira. We\u2019ve gone into payments across countries as well.\n\nMichael: How many users does Bitnob currently have?\n\nBernard: We came out of private beta with less than 1,000 users. Today we have more than 11,500 users and that\u2019s from January until now. So it\u2019s been an exciting year. Bitnob is registered as a U.S. company and has no Nigerian office. We target the African market and diaspora, looking to connect both parties.\n\nBitnob Co-Founder and CEO, Bernard Parah.\n\nMichael: Tell me about the Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob. How does the technology work?\n\nBernard: When you send Bitcoin on a blockchain, there\u2019s a confirmation time. You have to wait for maybe ten minutes to receive the Bitcoin and probably wait another 10-20 minutes to actually confirm that the Bitcoin has arrived. In some instances when Bitcoin prices go really high, a lot of people complain that their transactions are getting stuck or taking too long. That\u2019s because they pay network fees to miners who process their transactions. That\u2019s what\u2019s called the base layer or layer 1. You can think of it like a road where everyone moves and whenever there\u2019s huge traffic, it gets choked and vehicles move much slower.\n\nThe Lightning Network is another layer, like flyovers that are built over the main road to help ease the traffic and get people moving faster. The network is built on the original layer. Like flyovers that are much faster and with less traffic, the Lightning Network does the same Bitcoin transactions but it is instantly settled, regardless of where you\u2019re sending Bitcoin from. This is because it\u2019s not moving on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. The Lightning Network is what we call the layer 2 technology \u2013 like a highway on top of a road for people to move faster.\n\nIn addition, the Lightning Network is an open system that anyone can plug into. You can simply set up a Lightning node and immediately have access to a global payments system that offers superior functionality to legacy platforms. So Strike was able to immediately connect to Bitnob\u2019s node after linking with the Lightning Network. Strike users can then transact with Bitnob users using the cheapest, most instantaneous remittance option between the U.S. and Nigeria. More so, there\u2019s no need for the two companies to know each other, nor have any formal or commercial relationship. Neither us nor Strike built the system \u2013 it was built by bitcoin and the Lightning Network over the last decade.\n\nMichael: Won\u2019t there be delayed settlements if there are huge volumes of transactions on the Lightning Network?\n\nBernard: By design, the Lightning Network is supposed to ease transactions from the main Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions can never get too much because what causes traffic on the Bitcoin blockchain is the fact that it uses blocks. In a block, you have a certain number of transactions which take around 19 to 20 minutes for confirmation. Within those minutes when several people are doing a lot of transactions, it piles up and the Bitcoin itself processes around seven transactions per second. But by design, the Lightning Network can process more than one million per second. So it eases the traffic to a significant extent and it never gets crowded because the transactions are settled instantly. There\u2019s no wait time.\n\nMichael: What informed the integration with Strike on instant remittances?\n\nBernard: Chad and I both share similar visions of a world where you\u2019re not restricted to do your transactions. A system that\u2019s open, unlike traditional networks which only a few people can access, there\u2019s a lot of permissions and fees needed because of the several intermediaries involved. As Africans, we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of it. We\u2019re the ones who haven\u2019t really enjoyed this system.\n\nThe interesting thing about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network is that they\u2019re open. If two entities become nodes on the network, they become interoperable with each other. Let\u2019s say you wanted to send money from a Nigerian app to a Cash App account today, there\u2019s no way to do that. But with Bitnob you can do that because Cash App and Bitnob both support Bitcoin. It\u2019s an open network \u2013 as long as you follow the rules, you can communicate with one another. It\u2019s similar to the internet; if your device follows the rules, connected as an IP address, then you can talk to anybody anywhere in the world. The Lightning Network is also a protocol where any two nodes can talk to each other.\n\nSo Bitnob and Strike got together, tested the system between the two platforms and it\u2019s good. We figured for the Nigerian in the U.S., you can send money back home without having to touch/buy Bitcoin. You only download the Strike app, connect your bank account the amount you wish to send is deducted from your account. It is then sent directly to the receiver in Nigeria who has a Bitnob account. On the other end, the recipient in Nigeria can convert the money into Naira, on the Bitnob account.\n\nBecause we\u2019re interoperable with Strike, we\u2019re able to instantly settle transactions via the Lightning Network without the sender or receiver needing to touch Bitcoin or knowing that the transaction was done through the Lightning Network. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: How many test payments and how much have you transferred so far? And when is the official launch of the service?\n\nBernard: It\u2019s still in beta testing and we\u2019ve done thousands of transactions via Lightning since the video was released. We\u2019re opening it up gradually to a lot of people, giving more testers access to it, and just gauging interest before launch. The testing has been going very well with people moving money back and forth. It will soon be available to everyone, maybe in four or five weeks\u2019 time.\n\nMichael: The instant remittance service is free. How and why?\n\nBernard: We have other services on Bitnob that we make money from. People do automatic savings, buy and sell Bitcoin, take loans, etc. And on the Lightning Network, there\u2019s a number of ways to make money as a node. So we don\u2019t worry about the fees on remittances. Whatever amount you\u2019re receiving, it\u2019s coming totally free. We run a full Bitcoin and lightning infrastructure and are not really dependent on any third parties. So we can afford to shave off a lot of fees in different ways and still be okay.\n\nMichael: Can a user receive any amount or there are limits on transactions?\n\nBernard: When you\u2019re receiving, there\u2019s no amount. You can receive less than $1. For senders, the limit will vary based on the availability of liquidity and KYC standards. You can\u2019t just say you want to transfer $1 million. We have to watch out for things like that. So there are limits and levels based on your access level.\n\nMichael: Everything seems to be going perfectly. Do you see any possible challenges to this new super light transfer tech or a potential regulatory roadblock?\n\nBernard: It\u2019s not something I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s not like we have a bank account or any direct connection with a bank. So there\u2019s really nothing. All we\u2019re doing is Bitcoin transactions. And I\u2019m not sure anyone has banned Bitcoin transactions. Strike is just selling Bitcoin to us and it\u2019s entirely a peer-to-peer transaction with no bank in the middle. There are no ties with Nigerian banks or anything. If they let us have one, we will. But currently, we don\u2019t.\n\nMichael: What else are you working on currently? Are there exciting projects you\u2019d like to share?\n\nBernard: We\u2019re working on things that are potentially bigger than this and are excited about them. Let\u2019s see where we\u2019ll be in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "For getting low pay while in employment, late enrolment or non-compliance of employers to the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), about 3,398 retirees who left employment in the first quarter of 2021 would not be able to get a pension package for retirement.\n\nThe reason is that the balance in their Retirement Savings Account (RSA) as at the date of disengagement is below the threshold required to procure a pension package as provided in the Pension Reform Act.\n\nThe National Pension Commission (PenCom) during the first quarter of 2021 granted approval for Enbloc payment of retirement benefits to 3,398 retirees whose RSA balances were N550,000 below and considered insufficient to procure Programmed Withdrawal or Retiree Life Annuity of a reasonable amount for an expected life span.\n\nIn this regard, a total sum of N803,027,095.31 was paid to the 3,398 retirees, and they all came from the private sector, as against 3,499 people that received N848.92 million during the last quarter of 2020.\n\nYear-on-year basis, the figure was 2,227 retirees in the first quarter of 2020, and when compared with 3398 in the first quarter of 2021, it is a 52.6 percent increase.\n\nIndustry analysts say some of the reasons for this unhealthy development is poor compliance among private sector institutions, as some started compliance late, and when they started remittances were irregular.\n\nThey also attribute it to low pay earned by some employees, which amounts to almost nothing and too low to procure a pension package in retirement.\n\nThe implication of this is that many of these retirees would have to depend on their families for survival if they were not able to make other kinds of savings while in employment or become a nuisance to society, which is what the CPS seeks to address.\n\nRead also: Nigerians\u2019 persistent pension withdrawal mirrors rising unemployment\n\nPius Apere, an actuarial scientist and chartered insurer, says Nigerian pensioners have two basic expectations under the CPS, namely \u201cto have a sustainable standard of living in retirement and their benefits paid as at when due.\u201d\n\nApere, who is also the chairman/CEO of Achor Actuarial Services Limited, says the above expectations cannot be fully met for all pensioners without the implementation of the Minimum Pension Guaranteed (MPG) as stated in Section 84(1) of the Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2014.\n\n\u201cThis is true, particularly for those retirees with small Retirement Savings Account (RSA) balances because they have not accumulated enough as at the date of retirement to have a decent standard of living in retirement.\u201d\n\nAccording to Apere, the delay in implementation of MPG by the regulator many years after the CPS was established in 2004 has resulted in growing sense of disenchantment among current pensioners with relatively small RSA balances at retirement.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the small monthly pension they have been receiving over the years relative to the huge gains (from investment returns and/or dividends) the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) are currently making. The MPG if implemented would have eliminated the disenchantment among the current pensioners, he states.\n\nHe notes however that the implementation of the Enhanced Pension (EP) programme by PenCom effective from December 2017 aimed at providing sustainable standard of living in retirement for the Programmed Withdrawal (PW) pensioners could be seen as cushioning the effect of the non-implementation of MPG for these PW pensioners, but stated that this could not help those in retiree life annuity.\n\nMeanwhile, the Centre for Pension Right Advocacy (CPRA), has called on PenCom to put in place modalities for the full implementation of the MPG in the Pension Enhancement Framework, which PenCom introduced recently.\n\nThe group says the introduction of the Pension Framework by PenCom aimed at enhancing pension of those who are on Programmed Withdrawal under the CPS might not meet the expectations of pensioners.\n\nIvor Takor, executive director of CPRA, had however applauded the commission\u2019s initiative to enhance pensions but noted that what had been introduced through the framework was just a palliative.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for increased synergy between the government and security agencies to tackle the proliferation of arms and combat insecurity in the state.\n\nThe governor, who received the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya at the Government House in Benin City, on Tuesday, appealed for the setting up of military base in areas prone to kidnapping and armed robbery along Benin \u2013 Auchi Road.\n\nObaseki also received the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, stating the need to set up a special squad to tackle arms build-up in Edo communities.\n\nSpeaking to the Army chief, Obaseki noted: \u201cFirst, l have to commend you and your men for the cooperation that we have continued to enjoy with them. However, we are still having security challenges, especially the spate of kidnapping on Benin \u2013 Auchi axis.\n\n\u201cWe have military formations in Edo South, as well as in Auchi and Agenebode, both in Edo North Senatorial District; so that 120 kilometers space between them does not have any military presence, hence it is difficult for them to respond either from the Edo South or North when there is an incident.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the Nigeria Army to consider setting up a forward operating base to close the distance between the Edo North and South, as that will help us cover the axis where we are beginning to experience a lot of incidents.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cThe 4 Brigade has been very helpful in terms of supporting our community crisis. We also appeal that you support us with a special squad to complement our efforts in calming the restiveness that we are seeing around communities, largely because of land disputes.\n\n\u201cWe have laws in place that will help us deal with these issues, but when these communities find out that there are heavily armed men within their communities, peace will return to the affected areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say that we are very happy with you and will continue to support you by providing some logistics to ensure that you function optimally,\u201d Obaseki assured.\n\nUrging the IGP on the need for a special squad to tackle arms buildup in the state, the governor said: \u201cOne main challenge that we are faced with as a state is that of land grabbing, which has resulted in conflicts and arms buildup in our communities. We have enacted a law to tackle this challenge and set up special court that can prosecute anyone guilty to about ten years imprisonment.\n\n\u201cWe will be seeking your assistance to help us set up a special squad to handle this problem, especially the arms buildup in communities across the State. Some of these people have continued to pile up arms as they use sophisticated arms against themselves; this, we will not tolerate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a governor, my responsibility is to provide protection and security for Edo people and I can\u2019t do it alone without your support,\u201d he noted.\n\nEarlier, the IGP commended Obaseki for ensuring synergy between the government and the police, noting, \u201cEdo State is the best amongst states in the federation in terms of community policing. The federal government has adopted community policing to complement other security agencies to reduce crime and criminality in the nation.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the army chief disclosed that he was visiting formations and units in the army to interact with officers and men on ground to motivate them.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Deputy National Chairman (North) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Suleiman Nazif, has declared himself the acting national chairman of the party further deepening the crisis rocking the main opposition party.\n\nThis follows an order of a Rivers High Court restraining Uche Secondus from parading himself as the occupier of the position.\n\nMr Nazif, a former senator from Bauchi State, declared himself national chairman at the party\u2019s headquarters hours after his southern counterpart, Yemi Akinwonmi, laid claim to the position.\n\nThe court sitting in Port Harcourt had on Monday issued the order restraining Mr Secondus not only from parading himself as national chairman but also from taking part in any activity of the party while the order lasts.\n\nRelying on Section 45 (2) of the PDP Constitution, Mr Akinwonmi had declared himself national chairman pending the determination of the restraining order on the embattled Mr Secondus.\n\nBeing from the south as Mr Secondus, Mr Akinwonmi is next in line to the national chairman, going by the party\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening to a court order which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as Deputy National Chairman (South) of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, after the consultations and in exercise of the aforesaid powers, hereby deem it fit and proper to postpone the National Working Committee meeting earlier scheduled for today until further notice to allow for broader consultations in the overall interest of our party,\u201d a statement by the \u2018office of the national chairman\u2019, said.\n\nNew twist\n\nHowever, a few hours later, relying on Section 47 (4) of the PDP Constitution, Mr Nazif convened a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) which was attended by seven out of the 18 members of the organ.\n\nThe section states: \u201cIn the absence of the National Chairman and the Deputy National Chairman from the region part of the country where the National Chairman originates from, the other Deputy National Chairman shall act as National Chairman without prejudice to 47 (6) of this Constitution\u201d.\n\nAt the meeting, the former senator pronounced himself the national chairman, explaining that Mr Akinwonmi \u201chad been ill and incapacitated as a result of which he (Akinwonmi) would not be able to carry out the duties of national chairman.\u201d\n\nMr Nazif also said Mr Akinwonmi had not attended the NWC meeting and other party activities \u201cin the last nine months\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn this note, distinguished NWC members, I hereby take full charge of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as Chairman in an acting capacity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have waited this morning for the Deputy National Chairman (South) who has been incapacitated, who has not been attending NWC meeting in the last nine months and I believe there was a communication between the deputy national chairmen (south).\u201d\n\nMr Nazif also announced that the National Executive Committee (NEC) will meet on 27 August by 10 a.m. during which it would discuss matters affecting the main opposition party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLike you know, in the absence of the deputy chairman south, I take full charge, so I am hereby calling for an emergency NEC meeting on the 27th August, 2021, 10 am prompt to deliberate on matters affecting the party.\n\nALSO READ: Court restrains Uche Secondus from parading self as PDP chairman\n\n\u201cAnd I believe all the leaders of this party, the owners of this party, that will be in attendance are our governors, former presiding officers will be part of the NEC meeting to deliberate all pending issues.\u201d\n\nMr Nazif overruled Mr Akinwonmi\u2019s earlier declaration that the NWC meeting had been suspended until further notice.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMy position- Nazif\n\nSpeaking with journalists, Mr Nazif explained why he took over as acting national chairman.\n\n\u201cLet me make this very clear that this meeting was called for 2 p.m,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the Deputy National Chairman (South) has been incapacitated and did not attend any meeting in the last nine to 10 months as far as NWC is concerned.\n\n\u201cHe (Akinwonmi) has not been in communication with any member of the NWC for the last 10 months. And like I said, this party must continue its process.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am not available, someone else will take over. If the national chairman is not available, someone will take over. If the deputy national chairman south is not available, the deputy chairman, north will take charge.\n\n\u201cThis is the resolution that was passed by the expanded caucus. And this was the resolution passed by the NWC in our last meeting and we all agreed that there will be a meeting today.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was supposed to be presided over by the National Chairman. Unfortunately, the court order came from a competent court and stopped the chairman from acting as chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nRuptured by crisis\n\nThe leadership crisis in the main opposition party deepened a few weeks ago when some members of the party demanded the exit of Mr Secondus.\n\nMembers of the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives led by Kingsley Chinda (Rivers) were among who asked him to resign.\n\nThe crisis took a new dimension when seven deputy officers of the NWC resigned their positions and demanded Mr Secondus\u2019 exit for alleged incompetence. But the embattled national chairman vowed to hold on to his position.\n\nAt the height of the crisis, some party organs, including the Governors Forum and the Board of Trustees (BoT) held meetings to wade into the crisis.\n\nAt one of the joint meetings of the governors, BoT members and other senior members of the party at its national secretariat in Abuja, it was decided that the national convention should be moved from December to October this year to calm frayed nerves.\n\nNew members of the NWC are expected to be elected at the convention.\n\nMr Secondus-led NWC was elected in December 2017 and should round off their tenure by December this year.\n\nThere are allegations that governors elected on the platform of the party are divided over demands for Mr Secondus\u2019 exit.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Army (NA) has allayed the fears that repentant Boko Haram Terrorists are being enlisted into the Nigerian Army.\n\nA statement by the director of Army public relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, on Tuesday, dismissed such insinuation on the social media.\n\nNwachukwu stated this while reacting to a viral video by a comic actor, Young Elder, comparing Nigeria with Afghanistan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the video, Young Elder in a comic way expressed worries about the surrendered terrorists in Nigeria.\n\nHe said while it was understood that the situation in Afghanistan calls for concerns by any right thinking person or organisation, the manner in which the comic Young Elder presented it shows his lack of basic knowledge on the subject.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to an online video making rounds in the social media by one Young Elder and produced by Anthony Jay.\n\n\u201cIn the so called Young Elder attempted to draw conclusion from the collapse of the Afghan military and trying very hard to relate it to the ongoing surrender by the Boko Haram/ Islamic State West Africa Province.\n\n\u201cThe amateurish production conjured some unfounded and baseless claims that only exist in the pigment of their imagination, claiming that surrendered terrorists where going to be absorbed into the Nigerian Army (NA).\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the NA does not have any repentant terrorists joining its ranks and does not have any plan for that.\u201d\n\nThe Army spokesperson said there are teeming able-bodied Nigerians that are willing to join the NA and genuinely help in the fight against terrorism and other violent crimes.\n\nHe added, \u201cthe NA is not desperate for prospective recruits to stoop so low and engage the services of former terrorists. As a general rule, it is not even recommended to absorb former fighters into the services of a regular military.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu said the NA under the leadership of the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, will continue to operate within the dictates of the law.\n\n\u201cSurrendered terrorists will be received, processed and passed to the appropriate Government agencies that are saddled with the responsibility of handling them,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to the public that matters related to security should be left with those who have the requisite expertise and experience.\n\nHe also called on the comic actor to focus on contributing towards nation building and not engaging in campaign of falsehood.",

Douglas Fabeke, commended the Court of Appeal for the judgement confirming NPDC as the valid operator of Oil Mining Lease (OML) 11, stressing that the Ogoni people welcomed with great joy the intervention of the Federal Government and the takeover of the oil assets by NPDC following the judgement of the Appeal Court in Abuja.\n\nThe Ogoni leader described the judgment that handed OML11 to NPDC as liberation for the Ogoni people, stressing that the people of Ogoni have \u201clooked forward to this freedom over the years\u201d.\n\nHe further praised President Muhammadu Buhari for his administration\u2019s commitment to the development of Ogoniland, adding that his people would support all efforts aimed at restoring the environment and exploring its huge natural resources for the benefit of all.\n\nHe declared that Ogoni leaders have resolved to eschew bitterness and work with the Federal Government to ensure that the people benefitted from the resources in their land.\n\n\u201cThe Ogoni people are ready for oil and gas business in the land to entrench development in partnership with the NNPC and the Federal Government of Nigeria through a transformed template and practical community development delivered by the host communities.\n\nThe Ogoni people are ready to do all forms of businesses with the State, Federal and Global Corporate Communities for the development of their land, provided the business is anchored upon Ogoni development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe submitted a communique on behalf of the people of Ogoni to the Federal Government as the request of Ogoni people and as condition for the mutual relationship between the people and NPDC.\n\nThe communique, among other things, requested that \u201cthe issue of clean-up in Ogoniland should be re-visited and the Government should mandate the handling agency to expedite actions and clean the land in tune with the UNEP Report\u2019s recommendation or allow the Ogoni people to bring experts that would perfectly implement the recommendations of the UNEP Report to the letter\u201d\n\nIt also called on the Federal Government to expedite action on the provisions of infrastructure to the Ogoni people.\n\n\u201cThe Ogoni people will not work under any political manipulation that will affect the development and smooth operation in the land without capturing the interest of the people. We stand by every word drafted here and will implement it to the letter, and also ready to give the Federal Government of Nigeria maximum cooperation to achieve its aim for the success and benefit of the nation and the Ogoni people.\u201d the communique stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Managing Director of NPDC, Mr. Mohammed Ali-Zarah, said the company understood the concerns and yearnings of the Ogoni people and shared in their pain.\n\nHe said NPDC and the Federal Government would work with the Ogoni people to bring development, employment and growth to the land, remediate the environment and ensure that future exploration and production activities do not impact negatively on the environment.\n\nAli-Zarah noted that the large turn-out of people, including traditional rulers, at the event was a huge moral boost to NPDC\u2019s confidence in its re-entry plan.\n\n\u201cIndeed, this is a clear testimonial and demonstration of the strong cordial relationship that has existed between us over the years. This, for us, is our social license to operate in this peace-loving community\u201d, the Managing Director said.\n\nHe observed that it was in the best interest of the country to speedily restore the environment of Ogoniland and create the needed condition for the social economic development of the communities.\n\n\u201cAs a viable partner, we would join you to pursue the greater good of our people and the nation. We stand with you and would work with you to achieve this within the shortest possible time,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the communique submitted by the Ogoni Liberation Initiative signed by leaders of various communities that make up Ogoniland, Ali-Zarah assured them that he would send the document to the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for onward transmission to the relevant quarters, including the Presidency.\n\nOil production operations were suspended in Ogoniland in the early 1990s due to disruptions caused by local unrest. The oilfields and other installations have since largely remained dormant.\n\nHope was, however, rekindled last week following an Appeal Court judgment that paved the way for NPDC to take over the operatorship of the oil assets in Ogoniland from Shell.\n\nThe Appeal Court sitting in Abuja upturned the August 23, 2019, ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja which held that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was entitled to the renewal of the Lease on OML 11.\n\nIn the ruling, the Appellate Court held that the Minister of Petroleum Resources has the discretion whether or not to renew the OML 11 Lease in favor of SPDC. The Court further held that the Minister rightly exercised his discretion in awarding the OML 11 Lease to NPDC, a subsidiary of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

During the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\n\n\u201cThe Academy in collaboration with the 1Division Nigerian Army and Air Training Command as well as other security agencies in Kaduna state has since commenced pursuit of the unknown gunmen within the general area with a view to tracking them and rescue the abducted personnel.\n\n\u201cThe NDA community and Cadets are safe in the Academy. We assure the general public that these unknown gunmen would soon be apprehended and the abducted personnel rescued.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of Kaduna State House of Assembly, Alhaji Yusuf Zailani, has described the invasion as an assault on the country\u2019s territorial integrity\n\nZailani, who stated this in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ibrahim Danfulani, in Kaduna, on Tuesday, said that the incident must be treated with all seriousness and thoroughly investigated.\n\nThe speaker described NDA as the premier training citadel for members of Nigeria\u2019s armed forces and pride to the country and Africa.\n\nHe said the attack on such an institution was unacceptable and must be investigated by the military hierarchy.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening and unfortunate for such an attack to have taken place, catching those in charge of its internal security off-guard,\u201d Zailani said.\n\nWhile commending security personnel for making efforts to decimate bandits and insurgents nationwide, he said that they should not let the NDA incident demoralise them.\n\n\u201cI sincerely commiserate with the families of those who lost their lives.\n\n\u201cI am, however, pleased that the NDA authorities have given assurance that the assailants are being trailed and that they will be apprehended,\u201d the speaker added.",

This is the highest research grant ever. It has never gone beyond 200. We have 217 research grants that have recently been approved,\u201d Bogoro said.\n\nSpeaking on the recent special allocations by the TETFund\u2019s Board of Trustees,BoT, Bogoro revealed that N5 billion each was approved for University of Lagos,UniLag, and Ahmadu Bello University, ABU,Zaria, for massive infrastructural projects\u2019 development.\n\nThe TETFund boss said N1 billion was also approved as funds for the completion of special intervention projects for Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and another N1 billion for Imo State Polytechnic, Umuagwo, adding that more tertiary institutions would benefit from the special allocations in not too distant time.\n\nBogoro said TETFund is also providing support to boost research activities in Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria,DICON, among others, to address the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nOn TETFund\u2019s intervention in the health sector, Bogoro stated that the Fund has provided N1 billion to one university each in the six geo-political zones for medical research as well as providing facilities for treatment of major ailments like prostate cancer, kidney problems, among others.\n\n\u201cWith the Urology and kidney facilities made available, we are expecting a number of our teaching hospitals to come up with the capacity, granted that the equipment we provided, they should be able to do kidney transplant etc, in our universities.\n\n\u201cWe intend to continue strengthening some in terms of cancer facilities, urology research clinical facilities and heart facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe forum also provided Bogoro an opportunity to explain that the Board of TETFund has approved the review of overseas masters and PhD courses/specialization.\n\nAccording to him, more emphasis would now be placed on masters or PhD programmes that are science based.\n\nAmong the overseas masters and PhD courses specializations with effect from August 2021 includes: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, Biosciences, Biomedical Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, Industrial Systems and Engineering, Geosciences, Behavioural Sciences, Nuclear Engineering, Oceanography, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, among others.\n\nThe highlight of the event was the presentation of allocation letters to the beneficiary institutions.",

          "title": "Algeria Cuts Diplomatic Ties With \u2018Hostile\u2019 Morocco",
          "text": "Algeria\u2019s Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra said Tuesday that his country has severed diplomatic relations with Morocco due to \u201chostile actions\u201d, following months of resurgent tensions between the North African rivals.\n\nThe countries have long accused one another of backing opposition movements as proxies, with Algeria\u2019s support for separatists in the disputed region of Western Sahara a particular bone of contention for Morocco.\n\n\u201cAlgeria has decided to cut diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Morocco from today,\u201d Lamamra announced during a press conference.\n\n\u201cHistory has shown\u2026 Morocco has never stopped carrying out hostile actions against Algeria,\u201d he added.\n\nREAD ALSO: Zambia Swears In New President\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Rabat to the announcement.\n\nAlgiers\u2019s move came following a review of bilateral relations announced last week as it alleged Rabat was complicit in deadly forest fires that ravaged the country\u2019s north.\n\nLamamra accused Morocco\u2019s leaders of \u201cresponsibility for repeated crises\u201d and behaviour that has \u201cled to conflict instead of integration\u201d in North Africa.\n\nLate last month, Morocco\u2019s King Mohamed VI deplored the tensions between the two countries, and invited Algeria\u2019s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune \u201cto make wisdom prevail\u201d and \u201cto work in unison for the development of relations\u201d between the two countries.\n\n\u2018Provocation\u2019\n\nBut Algeria\u2019s forest fires, which broke out on August 9 amid a blistering heatwave, burned tens of thousands of hectares of forest and killed at least 90 people, including more than 30 soldiers, further stoking tensions.\n\nWhile critics say Algerian authorities failed to prepare for the blazes, Tebboune declared most of the fires were of \u201ccriminal\u201d origin.\n\nAlgerian authorities have blamed the independence movement of the mainly Berber region of Kabylie extending along the Mediterranean coast east of the capital.\n\nAlgiers has accused Rabat of backing the separatists.\n\n\u201cThe Moroccan provocation reached its climax when a Moroccan delegate to the United Nations demanded the independence of the people of the Kabylie region,\u201d Lamamra said Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Algeria recalled its ambassador to Rabat for consultations after Morocco\u2019s envoy to the United Nations, Omar Hilale, expressed support for self-determination in that region.\n\nAt the time, Algeria\u2019s foreign ministry said Morocco thus \u201cpublicly and explicitly supports an alleged right to self-determination of the Kabylie people\u201d.\n\nAlgerian authorities have also accused the Movement for Self-determination of Kabylie (MAK) of involvement in lynching a man falsely accused of arson during the recent forest fires, an incident that sparked outrage.\n\nAlgeria last week accused Morocco of supporting the group, which it classifies as a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d.\n\n\u2018Bad decision\u2019\n\n\u201cThe incessant hostile acts carried out by Morocco against Algeria have necessitated the review of relations between the two countries,\u201d the presidency had said.\n\nIt also said there would be an \u201cintensification of security controls on the western borders\u201d with Morocco.\n\nThe border between Algeria and Morocco has been closed since 1994.\n\nMohamed, a Moroccan bus driver, called Algeria\u2019s latest move \u201ca bad decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like cutting ties with your next-door neighbour,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe two North African countries along with Tunisia were united, he added, saying \u201cthere are no differences, this happens between governments\u201d.\n\nAlgeria\u2019s foreign minister also accused Morocco of leading \u201ca media war\u2026 against Algeria, its people and its leaders\u201d.\n\nBut Lamamra also said consular assistance to citizens of both countries would not be affected.\n\nRelations between Algiers and Rabat have been fraught in past decades, especially over the flashpoint issue of the disputed Western Sahara.\n\nMorocco considers the former Spanish colony an integral part of its kingdom, but Algeria has backed the Polisario movement which seeks independence there.\n\nA normalisation deal between Morocco and Israel in December triggered fresh tensions between Rabat and Algiers because the US recognised Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara as part of the accord.\n\nLamamra on Tuesday accused the Israeli foreign minister of \u201csenseless accusations and veiled threats\u201d after Yair Lapid expressed \u201cworries about the role played by Algeria in the region\u201d.\n\nOn his first visit to Morocco since the countries normalised ties, Lapid said his concerns were based on fears Algeria was \u201cgetting close to Iran\u201d, as well as \u201cthe campaign it waged against the admission of Israel as an observer member of the African Union\u201d.\n\nAFP",

Lockdown measures pushed Zambia into its first recession since 1998 and the economy contracted by 1.2%, according to the World Bank.\n\nAn easing of the lockdown measures in the latter part of 2020 and the global rise in copper prices resulted in some recovery, although inflation reached a high of 22% in February this year, according to the World Bank.\n\nZambia has established a reputation as one of Africa\u2019s stable democracies, with regular elections and peaceful transfers of power since the founding president, the late Kenneth Kaunda, introduced multi-party democracy and subsequently accepted defeat in 1991.\n\nHowever, fears of a reversal of those gains emerged recently as Lungu closed some media houses and detained critics.\n\nAP",
