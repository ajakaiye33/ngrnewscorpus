Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi.\n\nThe president affirmed that Victoria\u2019s incredible strength and exceptional courage during one of the darkest moments in our nation\u2019s history, pedestals her as a mother of the nation, God-fearing and a foremost woman of valour.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also joined other citizens in congratulating the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, on his 65th birthday, marked on Aug. 24, 202.\n\nOn Aug. 24, the president also hosted Senate President Ahmad Lawan at the Presidential Villa.\n\nLawan, who spoke to State House correspondents after the closed door meeting, described as false the 10 million dollars bribe allegedly offered to members of the two chambers of the National Assembly to pass three per cent host community development fund.\n\nThe president of the Senate frowned at the way and manner that some citizens had been spreading fake news and misinformation against the NASS and the government.\n\nNAN reports that an online publication had reported that the leadership of NASS had been allegedly accused of taking bribe to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nAccording to the speculators, Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, were paid in dollars to ensure the passage of the PIB which was signed into law on Aug. 16 by President Buhari.\n\nHowever, Lawan said: \u201cPeople say anything or everything about the President, about the administration, about members of National Assembly, they call us names and this is part of the intangible dividends of democracy.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso on Aug. 24, the president met behind closed door with Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno where he was updated with latest development on mass surrender of Boko Haram insurgents and members of their families.\n\nZulum told State House correspondents at the end of the meeting that 2,600 suspected Boko Haram insurgents who surrendered had been taken into custody by the security agencies in the state.\n\nHe revealed that over 100,000 people also lost their lives due to the deadly activities of the insurgents the 12-year old insurgency in the North-East.\n\nAccording to the governor, the state government is yet to account for the whereabouts of 10 per cent of its population following the 12-year old insurgency in the North-East.\n\nNAN reports that available statistics indicated that Borno State had a population of 5.6 million people as at 2016.\n\nThe president also met with Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau on Aug. 25, over the ethno-religious crisis in Jos and its environs.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents at the end of the meeting, the governor said he updated the president on the security developments in Plateau.\n\nLalong said President Buhari pledged that support would be given to victims of the violent clashes in the state.\n\nBefore meeting the governor, Buhari had earlier condemned the attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) by bandits, assuring that the attack will never dampen the morale of the security agencies in ending banditry and criminality in the country.\n\nHe noted that the attack, which led to loss of lives, came at a time that the military had put insurgents, bandits, kidnappers and other types of criminals on the retreat.\n\nThe president said \u201cthe heinous action would accelerate the total uprooting of evil in the polity, which members of the Armed Forces are solidly resolved to accomplish in the shortest possible time\u2019\u2019.\n\nBuhari commiserated with the families who lost their loved ones, praying God to comfort them.\n\nThe president vowed that the deceased would not die in vain, as the degenerate act would have consequences that would eventually clean the country of vermin, and emancipate the polity from deliberate, targeted and contrived atrocious acts.\n\nThe Presidency again condemned the promotion of ethno-religious politics and divisive utterances by Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue.\n\nMalam Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, made the condemnation in a statement issued on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nGov. Hope Uzodinma of Imo was also in the Presidential Villa during the week under review.\n\nThe governor briefed Buhari on security and socio-economic developments in his state.\n\nUzodinma called on Nigerians, particularly those in leadership positions, to protect the sanctity of the nation by upholding the Rule of Law.\n\nAccording to him, all citizens must condemn criminal activities whenever they occur and justice must be served on whoever is found wanting.\n\nSpeaking on the backdrop of Tuesday\u2019s attack on the NDA Kaduna, Uzodinma said people must not take the laws into their hands no matter their grievance.\n\n\u201cThe business of government is the protection of lives and property and we must act as a government and live up to the responsibilities of government.\n\n\u201cSo, we try to maintain law and order and condemn illegal and criminal activities as well as make those who are apprehended to face the law.\n\n\u201cSo many people are taking laws into their hands and some aggrieved people have resorted to self-help. Illegality upon illegality is still illegality.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Aug. 26, the Nigerian leader, who doubles as Minister of Petroleum Resources, announced a Profit after Tax of N287 billion by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in 2020.\n\nBuhari stated that the declaration was in fulfillment of an earlier pledge by the Federal Government to publicly announce the financial position of the NNPC.\n\nHe noted that the net profit was the first in the 44-year history of the establishment.\n\nAlso Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, on Aug. 26, presided over the virtual meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cAll 28 States that established Judicial Panels following the EndSARS protests last year have now completed the assignment, except Lagos State\u2019s panel which will conclude later this year in October.\u2019\u2019\n\nOsinbajo disclosed that eight States had so far turned in their reports on the EndSARS protest, saying the Council looked forward to discussing them in full at its next meeting as more States were expected to make their submissions as well.\n\nREAD ALSO: NDA of Irabor and Yusuf\n\nSpeaking on the consideration of the panel reports, Osinbajo said already Abia, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ondo and Rivers States had submitted reports of their respective panels, while Lagos state submitted an interim report.\n\nThe Presidency also inaugurated anti-corruption unit, warning that it will not hesitate to make an example of anyone who betrays the trust and confidence reposed in him in the course of his/her assignment.\n\nPermanent Secretary, State House, Mr Tijjani Umar, gave the warning at the inauguration of the State House Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit on Aug. 27, in Abuja.\n\nThe unit was inaugurated by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso on Aug. 27, Buhari welcomed Thursday\u2019s Q2 2021 report by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showing a third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, the president noted that the report also showed the highest quarterly growth in GDP since 2014.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01 per cent in Q2, 2021, following 0.51 per cent growth in Q1 2021.\n\nThis growth, which continues the progress of the preceding two quarters, is a continuing trend reflecting Nigeria\u2019s economic rebound, following the COVID-19-induced contractions seen in Q1 and Q2 of 2020.\n\nThe non-oil sector is a significant contributor to the economic performance in Q2, 2021, with growth of 6.74 per cent in real terms, the fastest growth in the sector since the third quarter of 2014.\n\nThe contribution of the non-oil sector to GDP increased from 91.07 per cent in Q2, 2020, to 92.58 per cent in Q2, 2021, according to the NBS.\n\nThe president commended managers of the economy for hard work and commitment, urging them to maintain the tempo till the positive development \u201ctouches the lives and pockets of the average Nigerian\u201d.\n\nThe main drivers of the Q2, 2021, economic growth included Trade, Information and Communication (mainly Telecommunications), Transportation, Electricity, Crop Production and Manufacturing, even though the service sector, specifically also recorded its strongest performance in more than a decade, growing at 9.27 per cent.\n\nThese main growth drivers of this second quarter performance are reflective of the gains from easing restrictions of movement locally and internationally and the improvement in the business and economic environment compared to the same period in 2020.\n\nBuhari, on Aug. 27, received a border security briefing from the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammed Babandede.\n\nBabandede later told State House correspondents that the agency had acquired sophisticated equipment and gadgets to help in exposing persons illegally staying in the country after the expiration of their visa.\n\nBabandede said new measures had been put in place by NIS to check illegal movement of foreigners into the country.\n\nVice-President Osinbajo was also in Ogun where he paid a condolence visit to Gov. Dapo Abiodun and the family over the transition of their 89-year-old father, Pa Emmanuel Adesanya Abiodun.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, Pa Abiodun lived a fulfilled life and this is why his memory is cause for celebration.\n\nThe vice-president was accompanied to the family house by both the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and former Ogun State governor, Chief Olusegun Osoba, among other top government officials.\n\nBuhari however ended the week on a sad note as he condoled with family, friends and associates of legendary musician and multi-talented artiste, Sir Victor Uwaifo, who passed on Saturday.\n\nHe joined the Nigerian music industry and performing artistes, home and abroad, in mourning the former first Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism (Edo), who was also the first musician and instrumentalist to be given National Honours Merit, Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) in 1983.\n\nThe president believed the renowned musician, with global appeal and recognitions lived for many firsts, which include invitation to the State House by four presidents and Heads of State, and winner of a gold disc in Africa for his song \u201cJoromi\u2019\u2019, released in 1965 at the age of 24.\n\nBuhari also extended heartfelt condolences to the Grillo family, friends, associates and art lovers on the passing of Prof. Yusuf Cameron Grillo, the pioneer Head of the Department of Art and Printing, Yaba College of Technology, Lagos.

          "text": "*Says finger print, graphology key to police efficiency\n\n*Nigeria is long overdue for national data bank\n\n*Faults thumb, index fingerprint by banks\n\nProf Michael Nwokolo is a retired Superintendent of Police. He is a Forensic, Security and finger print expert, National President, Institute of Public Safety and Security in work Environment and Lecturer in Criminology, University of Lagos.\n\nHe is the first police officer to be confirmed Professor while in service in 2015. He retired from the police force in 2019 and before retiring; he wrote many books and also made concerted appeals to police authorities for deserving promotion to no avail.\n\nHis last place of work was Force Criminal Investigations Department, FCID, Alagbon annex, Lagos Central Criminal Registry. The 58-year-old professor spoke exhaustively on the critical issue of using finger print and graphology in crime detection and prevention and highlighted efforts made to ensure its practical use in Nigerian without minimal success.\n\nExcerpts\n\nBy Emma Nnadozie, Crime Editor\n\nLast place of work\n\nI served for 28 years at Force CID Alagbon, Central Registry, Lagos. I was in charge of the fingerprint section for so many years. My services in the police were awesome. All the people I worked with loved me. I was fully dedicated.\n\nI was heard, I was visiting crime scenes all over Lagos and other states of the federation and having worked there, I started as a sergeant in 1990. I was enlisted into the Nigerian police force as a constable on 1st February 1984 after secondary school with recruit number 1859 and force number 144588. I attended Unity school, Agbaro, a special school for the brain child, near Warri, Delta state.\n\nHow I joined police force\n\nBefore I joined the police force, I was teaching at Otologbomi Secondary School in Ika northeast of Delta state. When they said they wanted to terminate auxiliary teachers, I started thinking what to do. Then, one thought came that I should join the police and start reading. On the day of enlistment, I was shocked they were measuring people.\n\nThe crowd was too much, then I went to one man and said, look you\u2019re measuring all these people, you are calling five papers but I have nine papers. One Calabar man called me and said asked if I have credit in French. He spoke French, I responded. He drove everybody out and said they should measure me. I was recruited and sent to police college, Ikeja. I graduated and was posted to Ogwashi-Uku, Delta state as a constable where I was in charge of firearms and secretary of police community relations.\n\nFrom there, I was transferred to State CID, Benin in 1987 -1992 before I came to force CID, Alagbon, Lagos where I professionalized.\n\nHow did you professionalize?\n\nI took many courses while in the force because since I joined the police, my mind is anywhere I stay, it should be very close to the office. So that I will be able to read very well and actualize my vision as an academic. From the force CID, I was attending so many courses. I had my B.Sc from Ondo state University, but before then, I did my diploma in University of Lagos where I studied computer management. When I finished that, I did higher diploma in computer management also. Then I did PGD in Business administration in Nigerian Institute of Journalism before I did 3 years direct entry in Ondo state university. After I finished from Ondo state university, I did my Master degrees in University of Lagos where I read sociology\n\nWhen I finished my masters, I was working with African Campus University, it was online, I wasn\u2019t being . I was just assisting them with training and some courses. All I did was just to assist them with my intellect with that they asked me to run their PhD. I did the PhD and I passed. I got nominated for professorial in that University and also Edeze University in Benin republic. As at that time, my rank was moving gradually from sergeant. I was a sergeant from 1990 to 2002. In 2003, I was promoted Inspector. Then in 2006, I was promoted assistant superintendent of police. Then in 2009, I was confirmed as full superintendent. Then in 2014, I was promoted DSP, then 2017 I was promoted superintendent of police. And while in the force, I wrote that those that are veterinary doctors were promoted to superintendent -double promotion, then why can\u2019t I be given this double promotion.\n\nHow I perfected in forensic and finger print\n\nIn 1990, I attended the first fingerprint course at Detective College, Enugu where I came out first in the whole federation and I was highly recommended. It was because of my brilliant performance at Detective College, Enugu that made them transfer me to Force CID, Alagbon, Ikoyi, Lagos because of my performance and when I came to Force CID Alagbon, I was attending so many courses. One, I attended an Abuja expert course on finger prints. I also attended some other forensic courses, laboratory courses, scene of crime courses, and so many other courses. Luckily enough, I was one of those that the police sent to Russia to go and study for the Advanced Fingerprint Course. So, I went to Russia and came back and I started heading a section, head of latent Fingerprint section. I started giving evidence in court.\n\nMost of the courts I give evidence to, because of my educational qualification, some of the lawyers were amazed. One lawyer asked me, you are a police officer, you are supposed to sweat but you made me sweat in the court today. I said yes, I made you sweat because I have a lot of knowledge, both educational and forensic. I am a certified security specialist. I am also an occupational safety and health specialist. I am also a port facility security officer and a fellow of about 15 organizations. I have handled so many cases while in the police. For security purposes, I don\u2019t want to give you all the details because I sent some people to jail.\n\nState of Forensic and Fingerprint in the area of detecting crime\n\nNigerian police are doing great because you cannot achieve more than what you have. So, compared to the resources the Nigerian police have, they are doing a lot in the forensic aspect. The Nigerian Police by now should have digitalized all the criminal records but the federal government has not given them the full assistance that is needed.\n\nThe records we have at Force CID, Alagbon, Central Criminal Registry, are in manual. Few are digitalized while some are not digitalized. The police are still working with the manual and partly digitalized. Police need more resources, more funds so that they will be able to digitalize all the criminal records. So many organizations have been coming that they want to digitalize the Nigerian police record but their problem, their hiccup or constraint is that some of the organizations don\u2019t have experts or software that can code the fingerprints. The instruments or equipment that would be required would be that of affix tracker, because the police had some equipment from Russia but we later realized that this equipment will not be in line, it will not interface. It is a papilon machine that records, interprets, documents, retrieves and searches fingerprints.\n\nThey gave Nigeria police twelve papilon machines that was about 2008 when we came back from Russia. But we found out that the Russian system cannot interface with so many parts of the world but the affix from USA system can interface with most of the countries of the world. What we need is finance and real people, transparent people that can do this digitalization. Another thing that I want the federal government to look into is that the job of Nigerian Police is very vital but the federal government doesn\u2019t know the importance of the Nigerian Police duties.\n\nThe Nigerian policemen receive lower salary compared to other countries of the world and I have written that in my masterpiece because there is a contention that if they are paid well, they will still take bribes. That is not it, it should not be so. Pay these people well and let them perform their job well. Thank God I am already out but I am still part of them because the police is your friend.\n\nREAD ALSO: Suspected members of IPOB flee over Police arrest in Bayelsa\n\nThey should be well paid so that they can do the job. And people like us should be employed to teach them some other areas like Graphology, Numerology, Psychology and Criminology so that they will be able to handle the civilian populace with soft hands. There are so many things that we need to imbibe in them because we are more experienced now than those that are behind. There are so many things that we have seen in the Police. These experiences that we have gathered in the police, we need to make them imbibe such experiences.\n\nWe want the Police to learn more from those of us that are Doctors and Professors and Forensic experts and Security experts. That is why I wrote to the Police that there are so many areas that they need to learn from me in investigation. Presently, I lecture Criminology in the University of Lagos and there are so many things that the Police should know in investigation. How many Police can interpret people\u2019s handwriting and tell you their behavior in this country?\n\nHow many?\n\nI can\u2019t count two or three. We need to teach them, we need to lecture them in Psychology, Graphology. We need to teach them facial expression and body language. I learnt all these things while in the police and since I retired, I have learnt all these things. Like this year, I have gotten about 11 certificates. We need to teach them psychology; we need to teach them ethics of the job, ethics of the Nigerian populace, the philosophy to love your neighbor as yourself. There\u2019s another area that we can teach Police, it is called Criminal Statistics.\n\nCriminal Statistics involve mathematics and graphs. If you watch, how many DPOs use graphs in doing their statistical data about criminals? If you\u2019re in a situation, in a place as a DPO, you should be able to get boys that are very good in Geography and in Mathematics. They\u2019ll be able to draw what we call crime statistics. Oshodi, Ikeja has this crime record, stealing is this number, murder case is this number, cybercrime is this number. Why are they committing these crimes? How can we get these people committing these crimes? You draw the graph and know the one that is higher, and find out why this crime is higher, in this particular area. Do we have those that can draw graphs in the police? No. but I teach this in the University of Lagos. This is because of my wide experience.\n\nHow it affects crime detection in Nigeria\n\nWithout being told, we must know that you cannot give what you don\u2019t have. I have earlier said that police are doing their best but those of us that have more experience in detecting crime using graphology, mathematical analysis, graphs should be allowed to be lecturing them in all the police colleges and in every police stations so that they will perform more than what they are doing.\n\nHow it can help the state of insecurity\n\nThe security situation, almost everybody is aware of, one of the problems is unemployment, and another one is illiteracy. These things should be tackled and if you watch, parents and teachers are no longer controlling their children. When you want to admit people, do we check the type of people we are admitting? They should be profiled, where do they live, how can we check whether they are cult people. These things should start when we are admitting people, we need to start checking if they are fraudsters, are they in cyber crime, and are they yahoo yahoo Boys. Do we check these things before admitting people in the school, no we don\u2019t do that.\n\nThe same thing in the police force, same thing in the army, we don\u2019t do profiling, we don\u2019t have profilers. We need to have profilers, who would check people\u2019s profiles. We have an intelligence section everywhere. Even before they enter school, we should start checkmating these things from the school. When people are sentenced, their fingerprints are not recorded, the lawyer will not talk about it, the judge will not talk about it, now everybody is pushing it to the police.\n\nIt is not only the police. Whenever you see something you say something. Security is everybody\u2019s business but in Nigeria, are we taking it as such? Those days when people are fighting they are reported. How many people are reporting cases to the police again? Most people don\u2019t report cases to the police again. So when cases are reported to the police and the record is made then the crime would start reducing.\n\nRole of telecommunication in crime detection, fighting\n\nThe telecommunication companies are not even helping the police. When you are talking about this person, when suspected money enters into account, will the police be alerted? If the police are alerted, police will do their job. And when we are talking about security, the bank should help the police when there is a suspicious amount, entering someone\u2019s account because the bankers know the kind of job each person is doing. So, when a sum of money enters into someone\u2019s account, they will alert the police, they will not, and this is one of the things that are causing crime to increase. So, if the bankers can help us, if the telecomunicators can help the police, then the police would do well.\n\nRole of forensics in fighting kidnapping, Boko Haram etc\n\nForensic will play a lot in reducing crime, that is if they allow them to come in fully because, as I told you, when you are talking about forensics, you are talking about the scientific way of establishing cases or to prove your case in court. What we should do is to train more people on forensic, when we train more in the police on how to check mate crime, fraud of any type, why is crime in this area prevalent? Once that graphing, the statistics is done, then it is a counter measure, it will reduce crime.\n\nDetecting activities in crime scenes\n\nActivities in the crime scene, that one will also pay a lot. I have visited so many crime scenes, uncountable. I have worked on so many crime scenes that they still call me to come and give evidence as a police expert witness and I have gone to so many places to give evidence. But where our base is, let us start by reducing crime while those that are fighting Boko Haram will continue fighting it.\n\nThen the police at their level, the DPO\u2019s, those in the training school should be properly trained. Police that are serving in various places should be trained, they should know more about this forensic, about detecting crime. No how to draft charges, know how to draw graphs about crime. Do you know any police station where they use graphs? We need to use graphs to analyze crime, to know crime statistics in particular places but the problem we are going to also have is finance.\n\nWere you frustrated out from the police?\n\nWell, I can\u2019t say I have not achieved my best because I have done great in the police and the police they know up till now, I am still a police expert witness and I am a lecturer in a University, University of Lagos. I lecture criminology. The police can invite me anytime to lecture people from one college to the other. I can do that, from one police station to the other. They need to get this knowledge; I have gotten some sought of knowledge indifferent areas that the police cannot offer. I thank God I have written so many books even in the section where I work. I am the first person that has written a book on Forensic fingerprint and that goes a long way. In that book, you have the history of finger print, how fingerprints started, the importance of fingerprints, when fingerprints can be destroyed and how to compare fingerprints.\n\nFuture projection about\n\nMy projection is that if I can be given a very good appointment in the Nigerian Police Force or outside the Nigerian Police force by the State or the Federal Government, given an appointment where my voice can be heard, I will do great for the country. I will elevate both finger printing and graphology in the force.\n\nAdvice on managing crime scenes and forensics\n\nThe advice I will give to the Federal Government and IGP is that they should collaborate. The IGP should continue to meet the Federal Government to assist in financing the police because the police are poorly financed. If you go to the DPO level, the DPO has nothing, no money. I think it is N30,000. What can he do with that? Can that one fuel Car? Can that one do the analysis we are talking about by drawing a graph, by visiting a crime scene, by analyzing, that one cannot do it. So, the Federal Government should come up wholeheartedly to assist the Nigerian Police Force and also assist Education because some people need this education.\n\nEducation is very, very important. I used to tell my children, seek you first the kingdom of academic glory and all other things will be added unto you. If I am not well educated now, you will not call me for this interview. I will not know the problems of the police. I know the problems of the police even if I am sleeping and I know how it can be solved but my voice cannot be heard because I have not been given an appointment. If I am given an appointment where my voice can be heard, where I can work with the Federal Government or the State Government, things will change, things will go higher. If I am given an appointment, maybe adviser to the IGP, adviser to the Federal Government, Special Adviser on security or forensic, I will do much.\n\nStill on fingerprints and forensic\n\nAs I told you, forensic science is that science that has to establish facts, evidence in any criminal or civil offences. It doesn\u2019t through operation but what it means is that people must be taught how evidence can be used. How evidence can be prepared, how crime scenes can be visited. It is the area where forensic comes in, the knowledge. There is nothing like a fingerprint. Finger print is very, very important. So when you\u2019re talking forensic, it hinges on finger print because if the fingerprint of suspects is not recorded, it means you don\u2019t have any record. It means there\u2019s no criminal record. So, people should be trained on finger print. Once they are trained on finger print, crime scene that\u2019s forensic, they should be able to record finger print of suspects. So many people are sentenced without recording their fingerprint. Forensic is moving forward.\n\nOn Central Criminal Registry\n\nWe have a central criminal registry that started in 1992. It started at Hunter Street, Lagos. The new name now is kaka Street in Lagos Island by Tinubu. That is where Force CID started. That is where forensic started. The first born of forensic is finger print. People must be taught forensic; how to record fingerprints, any suspect caught, before you are sentenced, your finger print must be recorded. So many people are released from prison without their fingerprints being recorded. We have a manual database but fingerprints should be well recorded and anybody going to court should be recorded. For now, we have little equipment, we are still on manual, why Ghana is digital.\n\nHowever, it is of utmost importance to digitalize the Nigerian police force criminal record and also we are ripe to have a national data bank. Once you enter this country, your fingerprint should be recorded in the database. It is like NIM but it is not, the database is everybody, in the country their name should enter into the database and their fingerprints so that whenever police want to use that, they can go there and get information.\n\nWhat about BVN and Co?\n\nWhen I went to represent police Central criminal registry from Lagos branch in Abuja, they were talking about BVN, they were talking about NIM and their record is incomplete. The fingerprints they take are just the thumb and index, while the police take the full fingers. The police are very reliable. Whenever you are recording fingerprints, it should be the complete ten fingers, the template, so that if anyone uses any finger to commit crime you will be able to track and get the person.\n\nBut why banks are using this is that they thought that in most crimes you can use these two to commit crime, that is the philosophy why they normally use these two. Many of them including INEC don\u2019t know this. They need to be well trained on forensic. When we are talking forensics, we are talking about fingerprints. If the fingerprints are not well recorded, it can be like yours, it can be like mine. If it is well recorded, there is nowhere in the world where two people\u2019s fingerprints can be the same. Strangely, in Nigeria, somebody\u2019s child fingerprints opened the mothers phone. It is defective. It was not recorded by an expert. That is why people should be taught.\n\nWhat about electronic transmission?\n\nAll these fingerprints they are using for election, if you watch they are not recording the fingerprints very well. For a fingerprints to be good, to be correct, the ink must be very light, the data must be there, the call must be there, all the rich characteristics must be very clear. I highlighted this when I talked about sanitizer, that sanitizer does not wipe fingerprints, those that are saying sanitizer wipes fingerprints they don\u2019t know what they are saying, they don\u2019t know the characteristics of fingerprints. There was a letter from the federal government for clarifications over the issue of sanitzer by the police but we said no.\n\nThere is no way sanitizer can remove fingerprints or the ridges in our hands. Those lines on our hands are called ridges. Those ridges are well arranged and there are some characteristics there called lake. So if you aren\u2019t a fingerprints expert, how would you know you have recorded a good fingerprint. That is why people must be taught about fingerprints. Fingerprints are very important.\n\nAny regrets?\n\nThere is no regret because I have acquired the knowledge that will help Nigeria. Because they will look for me one day, I am a certified security specialist and I am a senior lecturer in the university, if I am given vice chancellor I can do well, if I am given commandant, I can do well, if I am given head of any university I can do better. With my 35 years in the police and all the universities that I have attended and all the qualifications, I will do fine.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The fifth Saturday night party had several highlights worth knowing.\n\nIn the previous edition, the housemates turned up in African prints when DJ Sose held on to the wheels of steel but for the fifth Saturday, it was going back to the 70s.\n\nThe fun,which DJ Wysei dished out for the remaining 20 housemates, was immeasurable despite eviction lurking around the corner.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs always, drinks flowed ceaselessly. This time it was the global brand Johnny Walker that housemates gulped, and as expected, some had too much.\n\nHere are some of tit bits from the party:\n\nThe photo booth\n\nBig Brother decided to spoil the remaining 20 housemates with a new addition. A pre-party photo booth was installed by Tecno for the housemates to enjoy some photo sessions.\n\nThough not all the 20 housemates went through the session, Saga, Emmanuel, Pere, Queen, Angel, Nini, Sammie, Jaypaul and Whitemoney took more pictures than others. The housemates took time to bring out their inner modeling abilities.\n\nDJ Wysei turned it up\n\nDJ Wysei dished out unlimited fun on the turntable, becoming the fifth DJ to play for the housemates in the BBNaija Shine Ya Eye edition.\n\nDJ Wysei, spotting an unusual hairstyle, came prepared as she kept the housemates on their feet all night. She registered herself as the second female DJ that had appeared on the show in the sixth season of BBNaija. Viewers\u2019 agreed that Wysie delivered the best party of the season yet. The female disc jockey thrilled with a fine mix of Nigerian classic hits that successfully kept housemates away from the mirrors and on the dance floor.\n\nThe Afros\n\nSince the theme was old school, all the 20 housemates came to the dance floor rocking an Afro and some tight-hugging attires. On the dance floor, the housemates appeared to have had an amazing night with no exceptions. Unlike previous parties, the theme party saw the mirror gangs and the photo-ops gangs rocking more the vibes blaring from DJ Wysei\u2019s turntables.\n\nJackie B left Michael hanging\n\nIt turns out that Michael and Jackie B\u2019s hope of sailing a relationship finally capsized during the fifth Saturday night party. Towards the end, Michael and Jackie B got into a conversation that left him wearing a long face for the rest of the party and viewers believed it might have been Jackie B\u2019s insistence on moving on from Michael after what she considered an embarrassing action with Angel.\n\nNini, Saga remain inseparable\n\nThe party gave Saga another opportunity to enjoy the warmth and ambience of Nini\u2019s personality. Unlike Michael\u2019s cross, Saga enjoyed the night rocking his Afro, tight pants and obviously Nini\u2019s body. Saga and Nini\u2019s bond remained solid and seemed unshakeable during the party. As always, the pair remained almost inseparable keeping mostly to themselves on the dance floor.\n\nOn JMK\u2019s vibes\n\nOne housemate that has continued to give viewers and fellow housemates a run for their money on the dance floor is 26-year-old JMK. The trained lawyer with a massive derriere has continued to teach dance lessons on the dance floor. Aside from bringing new tricks and steps to the party every week since joining in the second week, JMK has remained a vibe and all the male housemates regularly take turns to savour her dance moves.\n\nCross unmoved despite eviction cross\n\nUndeniably the party beast, Cross displayed his usual positive vibe at the fifth Saturday night party. Known for his bare-chested moves, Cross remained unmoved about the Sunday night eviction as she coordinated the groove while partying like there\u2019s no tomorrow.",

          "title": "Southern govs open grazing ban: One voice, divided action",
          "text": "By Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri), Tony John (Port Harcourt), Okey Sampson (Umuahia), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Femi Folaranmi (Yenagoa), Obinna Odogwu (Awka), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Judex Okoro (Calabar), Geoffrey Anyanwu (Enugu), Tony Osauzo (Benin), Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan), Joe Effiong (Uyo), Lukman Olabiyi (Lagos) and Priscilla Ediare (Ado-Ekiti)\n\nWhen the governors of Southern Nigeria met in Lagos State on July 5, they were in high spirits to get a lasting solution to the rising menace of deadly herders in the region. The governors had earlier met in Asaba, Delta State, where they took far-reaching decisions.\n\nThus, in one voice, the 17 governors in Lagos agreed to end open grazing of cattle in their various states in a final move to check the atrocities perpetrated by \u2018killer herders.\u2019\n\nThey consequently set a September 1 deadline for the various states to enact an anti-open grazing legislation, which they hoped would end incessant killing, kidnapping, maiming and rape of women by suspected herdsmen in the region.\n\nImmediately after the Lagos parley, Osun, Ondo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Enugu states put machineries in motion towards enacting an anti-open grazing law, which our investigation revealed is already existing in Abia, Ebonyi, Ogun, Oyo and Ekiti states. In Imo, during the administration of Achike Udenwa, a similar law existed, but it is not operational in the state.\n\nThe Imo situation became clearer when last week, its governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma broke away from the joint decision of the Southern governors to ban open grazing of cattle in their respective states by his public declaration at Aso Villa that Imo State has no law forbidding open grazing by Fulani herdsmen, even when the law already exists in the state.\n\nIn this report, Sunday Sun looks at the positions in the 17 states in the South three days to the S\u200eeptember 1 ban on open grazing in the region.\n\nImo\n\nIn Imo State, a law prohibiting open grazing is already in place . The bill was assented into law on January 19, 2007 by the then governor of the state, Chief Achike Udenwa.\n\nAccording Section 3 of the law, \u201cRearing of cattle on the streets, main roads, residential and commercial places in Owerri capital territory and cultivated areas identified as Restricted Areas in Imo State is hereby prohibited \u201c.\n\nWhile Section 4 says: \u201cA cattle rearer shall not take his cattle into cultivated farms within Imo State.\u201d\n\nPenalties of contravening Section 3 and 4 is contained in Section 5. According to the law, defaulters of Section 3 shall pay a fine of N50,000 while that of 4, the defaulter will not only compensate the owner, but will also be left at the discretion of the magistrate for further punishment.\n\nThe current state Commissioner for Information and Strategy who was also a member of the state assembly then, representing Oru West, Mr Declan Emelumba, attested to the existence of the law.\n\nBut Governor Uzodimma in a chat with newsmen in Abuja last Wednesday verbally set aside the Imo law and rather asked for synergy between herders and farmers in the state.\n\nThe governor who had earlier maintained a stand with the Southern governors on banning of open grazing in Southeast and South-south in a dramatic twist after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday announced that there is presently no anti-grazing law in the state.\n\nHowever, Uzodimma on Friday through a statement made by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Emelumba, said that he was quoted out of context in his comments at Aso Villa, agreeing that a law banning open grazing already exists in the state.\n\nRivers\n\nConsistent with his public perception as a no-nonsense state chief executive, Governor Nyesom Wike worked with the Rivers State House of Assembly to secure enactment of the Open Rearing and Grazing Prohibition Law, which he assented to at the Government House, Port Harcourt, recently.\n\nIn his remarks at the signing ceremony, Wike said it was inimical to development and peace for any state to condone open grazing, noting that cattle rearing is a form of agricultural business. He said that the law has provision for ranching, which would end the frequent clashes between herdsmen and farmers, resulting in killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is no longer a story. All of us know what our people have suffered in terms of this open grazing. Today, all Nigerians have come to accept the reality that open grazing is no longer fashionable. Even our brothers in the North have agreed that it is no longer fashionable.\u201d\n\nAlso, Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, while presenting the bill to the governor for assent, said that the new law would serve as \u201ccure to the symptom and the disease of herders and farmers bloody conflict.\u201d\n\nAgreeing with Ibani, the Leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Martin Amaewhule, said that lawmakers delineated and gave speedy passage to the bill because of its relevance to the socio-economic progress of the state.\n\nThe law also forbade livestock owners or ranchers in the state from possessing or bearing licensed or unlicensed firearms within the vicinity of the ranch.\n\nReacting to the signing into law the anti-open rearing and grazing, Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Samuel Nwanosike, expressed optimism that the law would impact positively on the state.\n\nHe assured the people of the preparedness of the 23 local government areas of the state to enforce the law to the fullest. He said that with the law in place, the perennial herders and farmers crisis would become history.\n\nOn the key issue of enforcement, he said the government would definitely announce modalities for implementing the law in the 23 LGAs.\n\nAbia\n\nLong before the resolution of Southern governors, the \u201cControl of Nomadic Cattle Rearing and Prohibition of Grazing Routes/Reserve Law, had been in operation in Abia State since 2018, after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu signed the bill passed by the state assembly into law.\n\nThe law significantly stipulated that cattle could only be moved into the state by either road or rail haulage and also stated that movement of trade cattle to major towns in the state shall be by truck, trailers/vehicles or pickup vans. The law equally prohibited nomadic cattle rearing and abolished grazing routes in the state.\n\nConsequently, the law made it mandatory for any cattle found on any road in the state to be impounded by the appropriate authority or taken to the nearest ranch as may be provided by the appropriate authority in the state.\n\nThe law, which makes provision for ranch, stipulated that any violator would on conviction be liable to a fine of N200,000 or six months imprisonment or both.\n\nEnforcement of the law was bestowed on the police. However, the state Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, expressed displeasure over the poor level of enforcement, which he described as unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cThe police have the mandate to enforce the law and the level of enforcement presently is unsatisfactory. We are working on the security authorities to ensure satisfactory enforcement,\u201d Okiyi-Kalu said.\n\nIn the wake of continuing herders\u2019 activities in the state since the law came into force, there have been growing concerns over non-enforcement of the law.\n\nThere have been attacks on farmers by killer herdsmen in their farmlands in Ndi Okereke Abam in Ovukwu Autonomous Community, Arochukwu Local Government Area, which left scores of the indigenes critically wounded. Also, murderous herders attacked Ozuitem in Bende Local Government Area and killed scores of farmers.\n\nIn one of the incidents, the heartless attackers chopped off the fingers of Sunday Oru, one of the victims. Similarly, in Aba, a Fulani herdsman chopped off three fingers of a lady for daring to stop him from grazing his cattle on her farmland.\n\nOru told reporters that the herdsmen invaded their farmlands and fed their cattle with crops such as rice, cassava, okra and plantain.\n\nIn the Ozuitem incident just like in the one before it, the police did nothing when the affected communities reported the incidents. Instead the traditional ruler and some of the indigenes were detained at the police headquarters for allegedly killing the cattle.\n\nWith obvious disregard of the anti-open grazing law by the herders not abating, there appears to be no end in sight to the activities of the herders in the state.\n\nEbonyi\n\nEbonyi State was one of the first states in the Southeast zone to enact a law against open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe law became imperative following intermittent violent clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in the state.\n\nThe law had been effective, but without serious enforcement until March 31, 2021 when suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked three communities in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state and killed over 20 persons.\n\nWorried by the development, Governor David Umahi directed council chairmen to use local vigilante groups in conjunction with security agencies in their various communities to enforce the state law against open grazing.\n\nUmahi, who had been very accommodating of the herders, expressed frustration and disappointment over the Ishielu killings and warned violent herders who were still within the state to leave immediately for their own safety.\n\nHe also directed the police to work with traditional rulers to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that our law against open grazing of cows is still operational. I am, therefore, directing the council chairmen and the traditional rulers to use the community vigilante in their council areas and localities to enforce this law. Security agencies should also help us to enforce this law,\u201d he said.\n\nBayelsa\n\nWhen the Bayelsa State House of Assembly passed the Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Bill into law on March 9, 2021, Governor Douye Diri promptly assented to it the very next day, to demonstrate the abhorrence of the people to the atrocities committed by murderous herdsmen, who use cattle grazing as cover.\n\nThe law clearly and unequivocally stated that any herdsman found with arms, whether licensed or not, should be arrested. It also prohibited movement of cattle on foot from other parts of the country into the state.\n\nDiri, while signing the law, noted that its essence is to ensure harmonious living between cattle dealers and other inhabitants to forestall violent clashes being experienced in other parts of the country. He announced the establishment of a livestock management committee to regulate livestock activities in the state.\n\n\u201cFrom the commencement of the law, no person shall breed, rear or trade in livestock in the state in any other place as may be designated by the committee and approved by the state government,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the law having come into force, Diri warned that any person found engaging in open grazing of livestock would be deemed to have committed an offence, stating that the person would be arrested and prosecuted while the livestock would be impounded.\n\nOn March 17, one week after the law was signed, Diri inaugurated the implementation committee to enforce the law. The committee, which is headed by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr David Alagoa, has members representing various of security agencies in the state and traditional rulers.\n\nAlagoa in an interview said aside the initial hiccups of implementation all parties in Bayelsa are alive to their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThere has been no violation of the law aside the first time when there was a violation. What we did as a committee was that we invited all parties involved -Miyetti Allah and Butchers Association \u2013 for a meeting. We all agreed on achievable milestones at each point in time. Though there were initial issues about compliance, but now everybody understands the law.\u201d\n\nOgun\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of its counterparts in some other states, the Ogun State House of Assembly passed into law a bill sponsored by Hon. Ganiyu Oyedeji, representing Ifo II State Constituency, to regulate animal grazing and the establishment of cattle ranches in designated grazing areas in the state.\n\nHowever, Governor Dapo Abiodun, as at the time of filing this report, had not assented to the bill, which the Speaker of the state assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, had directed the Clerk of the legislature to send a clean copy to the governor.\n\nUnder the bill passed by the assembly, a section prescribed a three-year jail term without option of fine, including the forfeiture of the herds of cattle or livestock under his/her control to the state government except within the permitted ranches.\n\nDelta\n\nIn a twist difficult to understand, Delta State, where the decision to ban open grazing in southern Nigeria was taken, is yet to pass requisite law. This has led to growing concern that it may not meet the deadline.\n\nMembers of the state legislature debated the private member bill titled, Delta State Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation, during the plenary and sent it to a committee on July 14 after it scaled through second reading.\n\nMr. Yakubu Reuben Izeze, representing Ughelli South sponsored the bill, which has been stalled in the Joint committees on Special Bills, Agriculture and Natural Resources since July 26 because the assembly adjourned plenary, which is slated to resume on September 21, 2021, exactly 20 days after the expiry of the September 1 deadline for southern states to enact laws on open grazing ban.\n\nWhen contacted on phone, Mr. Izeze requested a text message, which he responded to very late by simply confirming that the bill was still at the committee stage.\n\nOur correspondent, however, learnt that the bill is suffering a set back due to the demand by the Cattle Dealers Association that at least 30,000 square meters of land should be designated in each local government area for livestock breeding and sales across the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the civil Society organisation, Victor Ojei, has bemoaned the lack of security architecture and logistics to enforce the ban in the state, when the bill is eventually passed into law.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying anything, no security meetings with the public regularly, no empowerment of local vigilantes through traditional rulers who are closer to their people. Delta Hawk is under-staffed, it does not operate with drones for aerial surveillance.\n\n\u201cNo town hall meetings in each local government to get first hand information on the challenges they face from these Fulani herdsmen who go about the state kidnapping, raping, killing and committing all sorts of crime.\n\n\u201cA provision was made in the bill for land use for livestock owners or businesses in the state, but we are hoping that those who will benefit from this compliance with the Land Use Act of Nigeria will not end up violating it,\u201d he contended.\n\nAnambra\n\nAnambra State which has been under the throe of herdsmen has not enacted anti-open grazing law and there were no indications that the state would be coming with one anytime soon.\n\nSunday Sun learnt from the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, that Governor Willie Obiano has not revealed his position on the matter.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take part in that meeting and the governor has not briefed me on it,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\nA member of the Anambra State House of Assembly representing Nnewi North Constituency, Nonso Okafor, confirmed that no executive bill on the matter had yet been sent to the assembly for consideration.\n\n\u201cAs of today, no such law has been passed in the House of Assembly. As of now, no bill has been presented because if it had been, it would go through 1st, 2nd and 3rd readings.\n\n\u201cI can tell you authoritatively that it hasn\u2019t come; except that it has come and it is still with the admin department. Such a bill has not been presented on the floor of the house\u201d, Okafor said.\n\nAsked why none of the members had thought about presenting one to the Assembly, he said: \u201cI actually put up a motion on that, to call the attention of the state government on the need for us to have an anti-open grazing law. But the motion was not debated before we went on recess.\n\n\u201cThat motion would bring about discussion for a bill. With the experience in the house, for such a bill to go faster, most times it comes as an executive bill or the house takes it up as a bill that needs urgent attention.\u201d\n\nCross River\n\nThe people of Cross River State may have to wait for a messiah to come to champion their desire to see the end of open grazing in the state.\n\nThe former Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Rt Hon John Gaul Lebo, in a chat with Sunday Sun disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass the anti-open grazing law in 2017.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun, Lebo, a two-time lawmaker and Speaker between 2015 and 2019, said that though the law was passed in the interest of the people, to protect the state\u2019s massive arable land, Governor Ben Ayade refused to assent to it.\n\nHe explained that the lawmakers rather opted for ranching because the state lacks empty landmass, adding that the culture of the people does not permit movement of cattle from one place to another because the people engage in arable cropping of cassava, yam, cocoyam and maize.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t support open grazing in our state. But if it is the culture in the North to move cattle around, no problem, they can do so there. The president under our present constitution does not have land to give to anybody because by the 1975 Land Use Act the lands are under the management of state governors.\n\n\u201cFor me I don\u2019t understand what makes the Presidency think that those cattle grazing routes are still in existence because those routes have been overtaken by development. Besides, to be talking of movement of cattle from state to state in this 21st Century Nigeria is inverse development and inverse engineering.\u201d\n\nEnugu\n\nNews of the introduction of the Anti-Open Grazing Bill on the floor of the Enugu State House of Assembly on August 10 brought joy to residents of the state especially those in the rural areas.\n\nThe executive bill, which was introduced by the Leader of the House, Hon. Ikechukwu Ezeugwu, who represents Udenu constituency, passed the first reading on the same day.\n\nWithin a week of introduction, the bill passed through the second reading and was committed to a joint committee comprising the House Committee on Agriculture, House Committee on Public Petitions, Ethics and Privileges and House Committee on Youths, Sports and Culture, with the Chairman of House Committee on Agriculture and member representing Isi-Uzo constituency, Mrs. Amaka Ugwueze as chairman.\n\nThe Hon. Ugwueze-led Joint Committee has fixed Tuesday, August 31 for public hearing on the bill.\n\nSpeaking to Sunday Sun on the deadline, the House Leader, Hon. Ezeugwu assured the people of the state that the House would meet up with all that is necessary for the bill to be passed into law, saying, \u201cwe are working on it and we will meet up with the deadline.\u201d\n\nHowever, an Enugu-based lawyer and rights activist, Olu Omotayo, frowned at the lack of willpower being shown by southern governors on the matter, noting that enacting the said law should not take more than one month.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom my own perspective, the governors have just been using that issue of open grazing as political gimmick. When you are talking of security that is the basis of any democracy. If security is lacking, you cannot be talking of democracy. Every other right starts from that; fundamental rights guaranteed in a democracy setting, stand on this issue of protection of lives and property. There is no way democracy can flourish without protection of lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the southern governors are just making political statements over a serious matter. Even before their statement, the states have attorney generals, who should have advised them that before you prohibit something there must be a law against it. There is no need for public ceremony. If they are keen as they always say repeatedly, I don\u2019t think to make such laws should even take more than one month, given the seriousness of the attacks we are seeing.\n\n\u201cBecause without that law, you cannot criminalize open grazing, so the law is very important to be made by the respective states in the Southern region. So without making the law you have not taken any step further.\n\n\u201cEnugu used to be the capital of the then Eastern region. Any decision taken here will have impact across the old region. So, it is important for the people in authority to make sure they live up to expectations of the people in the Southeast.\u201d\n\nEdo\n\nWith just two days to the S\u200eeptember 1, Edo State is yet to comply with the directive, checks by our correspondent have revealed.\n\nIt was learnt that Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to forward an Executive Bill to the House of Assembly on the issue for consideration by the House.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Marcus Onobun, who confirmed that he was yet to receive the bill, said that he would crosscheck with the Clerk of the House to ascertain if the bill had been forwarded.\n\n\u201cPlease, let me find out from the\u200e Clerk of the assembly\u201d, he said. He, however, declined to pick repeated calls made to his mobile phone afterwards.\n\nOyo\n\nOn Thursday October 24, 2019, the Oyo State House of Assembly passed the Anti-Open Grazing Bill into law with a view to fostering peace, promote agricultural business in the state, avoid continuous damage to farmlands, and end loss of lives and unquantifiable investments to constant clashes between herders and crop farmers.\n\nThe Speaker of the Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, said that all suggestions and Memoranda of Understanding submitted by various groups, agencies and representatives of different communities and tribes at the public hearing on the open rearing and grazing regulation bill 2019 was painstakingly looked into before it was passed into law.\n\nThe bill was thereafter signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, the law recommends establishment of a task force to be named, \u2018Open Grazing Prohibition Task Force\u2019, which will see to the implementation of the law, and would comprise representatives of the state government, security agencies, farmers\u2019 association, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, vigilante and the judiciary.\n\nThe governors of the Southwest of Nigeria had in January 2021 unanimously announced their decision to ban open grazing of cattle in the region, owing to the tension between herders and their host communities.\n\nThis was followed by the Lagos declaration by governors of the southern region that also set September 1, deadline for all states in the southern part of the country to have anti-open grazing laws in place.\n\nAkwa Ibom\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, the governor\u2019s executive bill on anti-open grazing was still awaited as at Friday. The Chairman of the state House of Assembly Committee on Information, Mr Aniefiok Dennis told our correspondent that information at his disposal had it that an executive bill through the state attorney general would be sent to the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment we have one that was sponsored by the member representing Mkpat Enin State Constituency, Bar Victor Ekwere. It has passed through first reading. But we have information that the governor is about to send in an executive bill. If they come with that one we will just marry the two and do the needful. But if they don\u2019t come, we have to continue with the one we have.\n\n\u201c I think we still have time and we can suspend every other thing and go ahead with it and have a public hearing so that members of the public would come and make input.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at doing something about it next week. Though we have the bill, we would like to have the executive bill and marry the two because the Southern governors appear to have had a template of the law.\u201d Dennis explained.\n\nWhen contacted, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Uko Udom, simply said; \u201cThe process is ongoing\u201d.\n\nLagos\n\nBarely three days to the deadline, which Southern governors set for their states to pass laws against open grazing, investigations have shown that Lagos State is not bothered about the \u2018September 1\u2019 deadline as the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had not yet transmitted an Executive Bill on the matter, to the state assembly.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, a credible source within the Lagos State government said that going by the body language of the governor, he would not join in the bandwagon of southern states enacting laws against open grazing.\n\nEkiti\n\nThe Majority Leader, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Olugboyega Aribisogan, said: \u201cThe law was enacted in 2017 in Ekiti State and it has remained in force ever since. At the commencement of the operation of that law, the state government set up a task force which they codenamed Anti Grazing Task force for Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cThis Task force has been monitoring and enforcing all the clauses in the law making sure that there are no violation of that particular law and in the cause of their operation, violators have been arrested and prosecuted in the court of law, some have been fined, some have been sent to jail and some cattle were confiscated by the government of Ekiti State.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.\n\n\u201cThis has practically reduced the incident of farmers-herders\u2019 clashes in Ekiti in the last three years and we have been able to proliferate this particular law into some other South western states and even the one being operated by other South western states was taken from Ekiti State and we have in the last three years been operating that law without so many problems. Up till I am speaking to you there are cases of violators that are still pending in court.\u201d",

We are going into warfare and we must go to a warfare united, you cannot win if you are divided. So, let\u2019s not lose hope. We must remain focus with our eyes on the ball.\n\nAnd we shall, by the grace of God, score that goal.\u201d Earlier, the acting National Chairman of the PDP, Yemi Akinwonmi, speaking at the opening session of the NEC meeting, said that efforts to resolve the crisis in the opposition party are yielding fruits. The PDP has recently been embroiled in crisis as its leaders battle for supremacy ahead of the party\u2019s national convention to elect a new leadership. The crisis assumed a new twist last Monday after a Rivers State High Court, in Degema, restrained its National Chairman, Uche Secondus, from functioning as the lead- er of the opposition party. However, on Thursday, a Kebbi State High Court, in Birnin Kebbi, issued an order asking Secondus to resume his functions as national chairman. In another twist, a Federal High Court in Calabar, Cross River State, on Friday, restrained the PDP chairman from presiding over yesterday\u2019s NEC meeting. However, Akinwonmi, who explained that the NEC meeting was convened to take critical decision relating to the convention, urged party leaders not to allow anyone divide their ranks. Similarly, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, commended those involved in the various efforts to resolve the crisis rocking the PDP. Atiku noted that \u201cif you look at PDP, it has the most experienced people in this country, whether in the executive wing, whether in the legislature, whether in party administration, we have the most experience and most competent individuals in this party. \u201cTherefore, PDP in internal crisis management is far more efficient and far more better than APC and the APC government itself\u2026 and Nigerians should no longer be in doubt, of our sense of patriotism, and our sense of commitment to get this country moving again. \u201c Meanwhile, the PDP has said its national convention scheduled for October 30-31, will hold in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this, yesterday, while briefing journalists on the outcome of the 92nd meeting National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party. Ologbondiyan said that the NEC will meet again on September 9 to approve nominations into the convention planning committee, as well as the committee on zoning.",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nBeautiful plus-size actress-cum-social media influencer, Mary John, has opened up on her sojourn in Nollywood, her love life, unique selling points and other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nHow would you describe yourself and personality?\n\nI am a strong and determined woman. I also see myself as a go-getter. Mary is fun-loving and easy going lady.\n\nHow long have you been acting and how has it been?\n\nI\u2019ve been acting professionally for six years now, but I have been on and off. This is because of my other activities and businesses. To be honest, in 2018, I became pregnant so I had to stop filming for two years.\n\nHow\u2019s the baby doing?\n\nHe is doing very well. Thanks. He clocked three a few months ago.\n\nSo, how has it been generally? What are some of the challenges you\u2019ve been facing in the industry?\n\nComing to the industry isn\u2019t easy at all; you have to put in some extra work. To me, I am not all about the everyday movies. If I have two good movies a month that\u2019s okay for me. However, I am okay and doing fine. There is no challenge that I can\u2019t handle.\n\nYou took a break to have your baby, when you returned did you feel you missed out on some things?\n\nYes, I felt it, but seeing my baby\u2019s smiles, I felt he is also worth the break. My baby\u2019s smiles worth everything and more\u2026\n\nHow does your husband react seeing you play romantic roles in movies?\n\nPlease skip this. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nAs a plus size TV star, what are the issues you encounter on and off set?\n\nFor the kind of body I have, men were all over me. But due to my determination and drive, I didn\u2019t give them the opportunity. I knew what I wanted, so I just waived off all the temptations that came my way. Many were coming for the body not because they were in love with me, but as an experienced woman, I know what I wanted and I stood my ground.\n\nHave you had any embarrassing encounter lately?\n\nAh! A lot, but the recent one was this fateful day that I was walking on the road and people started taking pictures of my butt, shouting that it was too big. It was funny and embarrassing at the same time, but we move on.\n\nWhat were your parents\u2019 reactions when you opted to join Nollywood?\n\nAt first, my dad wasn\u2019t in support, but when my movies began to show on Africa Magic he became a fan.\n\nWhat are the main difficulties people of plus size encounter?\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else because people face their own challenges. For me, none because I carry myself with so much pride. I\u2019m me and I will never want to be anyone else.\n\nIf given a chance, would you like to go under the knife for your body?\n\nYes oh. Just to remove belly fat, no additions to or subtractions from any other part of my body.\n\nLooking back, what are your regrets?\n\nThe only regret is that I got involved in a business that almost got me into depression.\n\nCan you mention titles of movies you\u2019ve done recently?\n\nAdaku is out, Perfect Game is a series and it\u2019s coming out soon. Perfect Marriage is coming out soon too. It was nominated for BON Awards. My other jobs aren\u2019t out yet.\n\nWhat would you say is your unique selling point?\n\nMy eyes, but most people will say \u2018Mary is a liar, it is her bumbum. However, I\u2019ll always choose my eyes and voice any time.\n\nWhat turns you on or off in relationship?\n\nMy turn on will be a responsible, caring, God-fearing man, who allows his woman to be herself at all times. A man who understands the word \u2018respect\u2019. My turn off will be an uptight man who thinks he owns the world. A man who does not understand that a woman too can be busy. Some men are so insecure that when she doesn\u2019t take his calls, she feels she\u2019s with another man. That is a big turn off for me.\n\nWhat kind of movie would you reject even if the pay is enticing?\n\nTo go completely nude is a no, no for me.\n\nBut you can play romantic roles?\n\nYes, but it shouldn\u2019t be too deep.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nWill Smith. I love him. But in Nollywood, it\u2019s Jim Iyke, I so much love that guy. His gangster game should be studied in Harvard.\n\nWho are those stars you\u2019re looking forward to act alongside?\n\nIn Nollywood, Funke Akindele because she\u2019s a strong woman with a funny character. She is a wife, producer, director and a business mogul. I respect her so much. Also, Mercy Johnson and Genevieve Nnaji. And for mothers, I like and respect Joke Sylvia and Ebelle Okaro because they are really strong women.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do?\n\nI am a plus size model, an interior decorator and social media influencer. I am also into real estate, and always open to business collaborations.\n\nCan you tell us briefly about your educational background?\n\nMy educational story is very deep. My mates wrote JAMB once, but mine was four times. Well, it\u2019s not because I was not brilliant, but I didn\u2019t know the forces behind me not passing. However, the last time I wrote JAMB, I got admission into a private polytechnic and I studied Performing and Media Art. That was how I started my career as an actor.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "title": "PDP governors joining APC signal we\u2019ll retain power in 2023 \u2013 Senator Osita Izunaso",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nArmed as an English graduate, a journalist, politician and now a lawyer, Senator Osita Izunaso, has no doubt become an indispensable asset of sort in the country.\n\nAfter his Call to Bar recently, he spoke to Sunday Sun on various range of issues including his motivation to return to school to study Law at old age, the contentious APC zoning arrangement ahead of the 2023 presidential election, the crisis rocking the APC in both national and his state, Imo, and the possibility of the APC retaining power beyond President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHaving equipped yourself in areas of journalism, politics and now law, what is next for you?\n\nI will remain in politics, but will not go far away from law. The only thing I may probably not do again is journalism. Once the court resumes from vacation, I will start going to court. I am going to attach myself with one of the most serious chambers in town to go through the practical legal tutelage before setting up my own chambers and employing lawyers to work with me.\n\nGoing by the enviable records you have built in politics, would you say that this is the APC of your dream?\n\nYou know that the party came to be as a merger and amalgamation of three, four or five entities. While three came in full, two others came half. The party struggled to gain power. Yes, we are still in power, but you don\u2019t expect us to get everything right. Don\u2019t forget that even the PDP that ruled for 16 years did not get everything right. What the APC is doing now is still a learning process of a learning party. We are still putting our acts together and putting things right. We might make some mistakes, but the truth of the matter is that whenever there is a problem in the APC, such problems never scatter the party. APC is doing well, but there is still room for correction of what we have not done well.\n\nWhich regime created more problems for APC between Oyegun not returning or Oshiomhole\u2019s removal?\n\nYou know that I was directly involved and would not want to comment on this so that people will not misinterpret me. However, everybody knows that when Oyegun was chairman, there was some level of proper party administration and cohesion. He does not go to NWC meetings with a mindset and believes that his thoughts will prevail. That is not correct. Under Oyegun, the meeting decides what happens. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to dabble into those areas. The good thing is that our party is on the right track and footing again. The congresses are conducted which will end with a national convention. The convention will guarantee the final stability of the APC.\n\nWhat are your fears against APC coasting home in the 2023 elections?\n\nWhy should I entertain any fear when the governors of the PDP are joining us, the APC, on their own? Even the blinds could see that the APC is growing bigger than what it was previously. Yes, I admit that the party grew high at one point and shaded weight; however, it is getting fatter again. The indication of the growth is that APC is getting fatter towards the election, which means that the party will certainly coast to victory in the 2023 general elections. Let me emphasize it that even if there are crises after the convention, it will still be sorted out well enough before we go into the primaries that will produce the candidate of our party for the 2023 elections.\n\nDid you take into consideration the fact that President Buhari will not contest the election in expressing confidence for APC victory?\n\nIf President Buhari is not contesting, does it mean that he will not have interest in what is going on in the party? An Igbo adage says that traditional rulers should not put hands in politics did not say that they should also remove their eyes. President Buhari will remain a major factor in deciding who the party\u2019s presidential candidate will be in 2023 whether he is contesting or not.\n\nWhat is your take on Igbo presidency in 2023?\n\nThat matter will be settled very soon. The party has not zoned any position to any place. There is going to be a zoning committee to decide which zone gets what. Party members will understand what is expected of them. But, you should know that APC will start zoning with the party\u2019s leadership positions. It is after this first zoning that we decide on the elective zoning arrangements. There is no need for anybody to get worried about the zoning arrangements for the 2023 presidential ticket. I am sure that APC must do what is fair and right. We should not start putting the cart before the horse. We are almost there and there is no need for this hurry and anxiety over zoning.\n\nHave you also heard the speculations that Southeast has no competent person to give the party\u2019s ticket?\n\nHow can anybody say such a thing? It is not true because there is no zone in this country that does not have thousands of competent hands to rule this country. People should dismiss with the wave of the hand the speculation that the Southeast has no competent person to produce a president.\n\nDid your attending Imo APC stakeholders\u2019 meeting confirm that there is peace in the party\u2019s state chapter?\n\nOf course, there has always been peace in the APC in Imo State. The governor is in charge. So, what is wrong in attending the meeting as major stakeholders of Imo State? On the contrary, if I didn\u2019t attend, it would be a confirmation that I am not politically relevant in the state. For your information, some of the people that did not attend were actually invited, but could not make it due to one engagement or the other. I don\u2019t think there is any debate over the peace in the APC fold in Imo State. Yes, there are people who may not agree with one another, but that does not mean that the party is not peaceful in the state. In Nigeria today, there are people who don\u2019t agree with President Buhari, but does that dispute the fact that he is the president of this country? Even if there is disagreement, there must always be a forum for reconciliation.\n\nWhy has it become difficult for Imo APC stakeholders to reconcile the governor and Okorocha?\n\nIt is wrong to say that the governor and Okorocha are fighting each other. It is a misinterpretation of what is going on in the Imo APC. There is no basis for any fighting because one is the governor while the other is the past governor. The party is big enough to accommodate everybody. During registration, everybody was told to register and how is it anybody\u2019s fault if someone chose not to register. I don\u2019t think that there is any quarrel, so to say, between the governor and the past governor. The question necessary now is what Imo people want at this point. Is the governor doing what Imo people want or not and if he is not, then it means that he is not doing well. It is not a personality thing and we must know that no singular person is above the state. A governor will come and go, but the state remains. The most popular person to govern Imo State is no longer alive, yet people still talk about him. His legacy is speaking for him and every governor must try to leave a legacy for people to remember him when he is no longer here.\n\nAs a member of the Campaign Committee for Anambra governorship election, are you comfortable with the aftermath of the state party primaries?\n\nAPC has bright chances to win the Anambra governorship election. I did not play an active role in the primary, but I can tell you that some people are not happy with the way the primary went. However, what is certain is that there is always room for reconciliation. Therefore, the first assignment for the Campaign Committee will be to reconcile the aggrieved persons. We have to do that even before we start election strategy and planning. We must have to listen to the aggrieved persons and even create a reconciliatory sub-committee to ensure they were not shutout.\n\nWhat advice do you have for those behind the spate of insecurity in the Southeast?\n\nI am happy that peace is gradually returning in the Southeast especially in Imo State. There are great improvements from what it used to be three months ago. Some people are beginning to reason better. Even in war situations, people still engage in dialogue. What we actually need most in the zone right now is peace. Even in protesting against those things we felt were denied us, we need a peaceful atmosphere to make our agitations known. Only recently, we saw the traditional rulers pouring libation on the ground in Imo, urging our sons and daughters to calm down and embrace peace. Nobody is saying that people should not air their minds, but we must give peace a chance. What is happening is not what anybody should encourage and no Igbo culture encourages anybody taking another person\u2019s life. It should be detested because killing is an abomination in Igbo land. In Igbo land, no matter how you struggle for anything with anybody, it is not possible to allow it to degenerate to the level of killing someone.\n\nWhat motivated you to return to school to study law at an old age?\n\nReading law was an ambition I nursed even when I was a young person. After getting my A-Level, my ambition was to go back to school and read Law. But I was given English instead of the course I desired when I gained admission in the University of Jos. I thought I would switch over after the first year, but because it was a direct entry for three years, it became very difficult to change the course. When I graduated, I left the ambition to read Law for a while and ventured into journalism after a Post Graduate Diploma in Journalism. I practiced journalism until I ventured into politics which is also very time-consuming. Despite all these, the desire to return to school to study law still persisted. I actually did by gaining admission to Nile University to read the course. However, after graduation, I faced the challenge of going to Law School because it is time consuming and stressful. The lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic struck three months after my commencement of the programme, but they continued online until we finished all the course work. The satisfaction is that I was eventually called to the Bar after everything. It is the satisfaction of a long-time ambition. I like my tenacity, resilience, perseverance and doggedness to continue with the programme because it is something that any small thing would have disrupted. I even lost some opportunities because reading law prevented me from getting one government appointment or the other. I resolved that good things can always come because once you are appointed into any executive position; you have to withdraw from Law School.\n\nFrom journalism to politics and now law, where do you think you can fit in most?\n\nOn the contrary, we should look at it from the point of versatility. However, I can tell you that journalism properly prepared and propelled me into venturing into politics. As a journalist, you read a lot; meet many people, and you are a custodian of the past and the present. Journalism brought me close to the political class and was a very fantastic foundation and launchpad for me to venture into politics. I have worked in both chambers of the House of Representatives and Senate as a staff. I have also been a member of both chambers as a legislator. All these are courtesy of my background as a journalist. As a politician, I noticed that politics is an interesting game. I am already deep into politics and I am not quitting it for now. I love the intrigues in politics. It is a game with lots of interests Law, as I said earlier, is something I have always dreamt of. Now that I have done it, I will still practice the profession and my satisfaction is to practice what I have learnt and the profession I believe was my first calling. I am full of expectation of how far I can fit into it. Even when I relate with people, they keep asking me if I am a lawyer. Others even called me an apprentice lawyer while we were in the APC NWC. I don\u2019t attend NWC meetings without arming myself with both the party and Nigeria constitution. I even go deeper to read the other party\u2019s constitution which helped me to speak with authority on most legal issues. I almost dropped out in my second and third year because the pressure of work was getting too much, but my happiness is that I persevered especially when I was rigged out of my victory during the last APC National Convention. I saw it as divine directive to help me complete the studies.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "*Insists his tenure ends December\n\n*Party crisis deepens as another court sacks national chairman\n\n*NEC meets September 9 for approval of zoning of offices, convention committees\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) took place yesterday in the absence of the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nSecondus last night insisted that his four-year tenure would end in December.\n\nNEC, however, asked the six-man committee headed by the former Senate President, Senator David Mark to meet with stakeholders to resolve the matter.\n\nIt also adopted October 31 as the date of the national convention scheduled in Abuja, as recommended by the 40th meeting of the National Caucus of the party held on Friday.\n\nThe NEC also resolved to meet again on September 9 to adopt recommendations for the zoning of offices for the convention.\n\nBefore the meeting, Secondus in a deft political move, asked the Deputy National Chairman (South), Mr. Yemi Akinwomi, to preside over the NEC meeting of the party in his stead.\n\nSecondus, however, clarified last night that he has not resigned from his position but was only obeying court order.\n\nHe had been fighting for survival as the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nA Rivers State High Court had restrained Secondus from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nBarely 24 hours later, a Kebbi State High Court reinstated him as the chairman of the party.\n\nBut few hours after returning to his desk, a Cross River High Court stopped him from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party and also restrained him from presiding over the NEC meeting that took place yesterday.\n\nSecondus in a letter to Akinwomi, said: \u201cI hereby request you to preside over the National Executive Committee meeting of the party, taking place today, 28th August, 2021@ noon, in my absence.\u201d\n\nThe interim order from a Cross River High Court was issued by Justice Edem Kufre, on Friday upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani, ahead of the PDP NEC.\n\nSecondus had obtained a Kebbi High Court order to return to his desk as national chairman last Thursday following an earlier injunction obtained against him from a Rivers State High Court.\n\nBriefing journalists after yesterday\u2019s NEC meeting, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said, \u201cNEC has resolved that Abuja will be the venue of the PDP National Elective Convention slated for October 31, 2021.\n\n\u201cNEC is to meet on the 9th of September to approve the various nominations into the respective national convention committees,\u201d the spokesman of the PDP said.\n\nAccording to the PDP spokesperson, \u201cNEC emphasised the indivisibility of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and stressed the need to remain united as a party as we work assiduously towards removing the inept, indolent and corrupt APC from government, come 2023.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan said that the NEC meeting of September 9 will come up with recommendations on zoning and composition of the various convention committees.\n\nHe said that NEC urged members to continue to make personal sacrifices in the overall interest of the party while commending the PDP governors\u2019 effort in inaugurating landmark projects in all states of the federation where the party has been handed over the responsibility of government.\n\nAccording to Ologbondiyan, the NEC urged Nigerians to take a cue from the deliverables in the respective states as a sign of the improvements that the party wishes to deliver when elected in 2023.\n\nHe said the party boasts of more experienced hands in party politics as well as governance, saying that its internal crisis management mechanism is far better than the operations of the APC as a party and even as government.\n\nHe added that NEC commended all party members for their various involvements in resolving issues that have recently occurred in the party and expressed confidence that the PDP has earned the trust of Nigerians once again and that the party will do better when allowed to lead the nation.\n\nAlso, he said that NEC condemned the media gagging and the attempt by the APC and President Buhari\u2019s government to promote obnoxious laws against the freedom of speech as well as media practice in Nigeria.\n\nNEC, he said, condemned the harassment and intimidation of media outfits in a desperate ploy by the APC to stifle free speech.\n\nSpeaking at the opening session of the NEC meeting, the chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal commended members of the party for their support.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs your ambassadors, we thank every one of you, our leaders, and our members across the country, for your support for your prayers, for all of the successes we have recorded in our state. Of course, you know, whenever I hear of any major event activity, or commissioning a project is happening only in PDP states, we shall continue to do our best. And we assure you of our total loyalty to our party.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issues of the moment, challenges, disputes, and disagreements are part of life, and indeed, politics. But what is important is how they are resolved. We have activated all mechanisms that we have in PDP, to resolve all of our issues. And as the chairman of PDP said, I concur.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to hold together, remain together because we are the hope of the people of Nigeria and Nigerians are looking forward to PDP and we cannot afford to fail them.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are quite many and we need to continue to work together as a family. We are going into warfare and we must go to a warfare united, you cannot win if you are divided. So let\u2019s not lose hope. We must remain focus with our eyes on the ball. And we shall, by the grace of God, score that goal,\u201d Tambuwal explained.\n\nAlso, the Senate Minority Leader Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said: \u201cI want to assure you that as members of the National Assembly, we are with our party. The chairman and Deputy Chairman have this morning made statements to show that there is no crack in PDP.\n\n\u201cAs we were coming yesterday, I think we\u2019ve seen from the news that there were alternate chairman, deputies, and all that. But today, I think it\u2019s clear to everyone that PDP is one and we\u2019re moving forward. I want to thank our chairman of the governor\u2019s forum for assuring us that PDP will take over the government in 2023. Nigerians are looking for us.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired of that party that doesn\u2019t even have a board of trustees, not to talk of any other organ of the party. Nigeria\u2019s are tired of the party that is looking for a word to gag you the press, in an interview that was done that showed clearly how things are going bad in this country, and people are being summoned to answer queries at the NBC, which has never happened in this country. And so PDP is coming, Nigerians wait for PDP, and in 2023 give us your votes and will we deliver you back to where we came from.\n\nAlso, the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar in his speech said, \u201cIf you look at PDP, it has the most experienced people in this country, whether in the executive wing, whether in the legislature, whether, in party administration, we have the most experienced and most competent individuals in this party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, PDP in internal crisis management is far far more efficient and far better than APC and the APC government itself. So, I want to use this opportunity to commend and thank everybody who has been involved in trying to resolve the recent crisis. And Nigerians should no longer be in doubt, of our sense of patriotism, and our sense of commitment to get this country moving again.\n\n\u201cWe are being taken aback by the APC government and we have shown to Nigerians that, when we are trusted again, we will do even much better than we had done before,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nI Have Not Resigned, Says Embattled PDP Chairman\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus last night debunked rumours making the rounds that he had resigned from his position.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi, the embattled PDP national chairman said it was not true that he has resigned but was obeying the interim order by the Cross State High Court sitting in Calabar.\n\nHe added that as a law-abiding citizen who has been an adherent of rule of law as a basis for democracy, he had to stay away in respect for the courts.\n\n\u201cMedia office of Prince Uche Secondus wishes to correct erroneous news circulating that he has stepped down as the National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus by his unavoidable absence at the party\u2019s NEC meeting on Saturday was merely obeying an interim order from Cross River State High Court.\n\n\u201cAs a law abiding citizen who has been an adherent of rule of law as a basis for democracy stayed away in respect for the courts.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus\u2019 four-year mandate to lead the party given on December 10, 2017 ends by December, 2021.\n\n\u201cBy this release, the media office wishes to urge media houses and members of the public, particularly beloved members of PDP, to disregard any news suggesting that he has stepped down,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*South Africa\u2019s GDP now $370bn, Nigeria\u2019s $432bn\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nNigeria has maintained her position as Africa\u2019s biggest economy after South Africa released the report of its rebased Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that pushed the latter\u2019s economy up by 11 per cent, an analysis of a new report by Statistics South Africa (SSA), has revealed.\n\nAfter a comprehensive overhaul of its national accounts up to the end of the 2020 fiscal year, South Africa disclosed in the SSA that the value of her economy increased to $370 billion as a result of the rebasing exercise.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nDuring the period under review, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the World Bank put Nigeria\u2019s GDP at $432.29 billion, indicating that her economy was $62.29 billion bigger than South Africa\u2019s after the latter rebased its GDP.\n\nIn a summary report obtained from its official website at the weekend, South Africa\u2019s statistics agency said the latest GDP rebasing and benchmarking exercise had resulted in an upward revision in the size of the economy, as well as changes to the composition of the supply and demand sides of economic activity.\n\nSpecifically, SSA\u2019s rebasing report showed that the rebased GDP \u201cis 11 per cent larger in 2020 than previously estimated. Between 2011 and 2020, the percentage difference between the previous and revised levels averaged 9.6 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe percentage difference ranged between 8.6 per cent in 2014 to 11 per cent in 2020. The time series was revised from 1993. Differences between previous and revised levels are a typical outcome of rebasing and benchmarking exercises,\u201d SSA revealed in its latest report released midweek.\n\nComparatively, the report said the average increase between previous and revised GDP estimates across OECD countries was 3.8 per cent in 2010, ranging from 0.2 per cent for Luxembourg to 7.8 per cent for South Korea.\n\nIt added: \u201cLatin America recorded an average increase of 8.8 per cent and closer to home; Botswana revised the size of its economy down by 10 percent. How does South Africa\u2019s revised GDP affect its standing in Africa?\n\n\u201cIn terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), the World Bank currently ranks South Africa as the third biggest economy on the continent after Egypt and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEgypt\u2019s GDP (PPP$ in current prices) was PPP$1,290 billion, according to the World Bank\u2019s estimate, higher than that of Nigeria (PPP$1,069 billion) and South Africa (PPP$717 billion),\u201d the report said.\n\nDespite the 11 per cent increase recorded after rebasing, Africa\u2019s most advanced economy still lags behind Nigeria, which is at N154.25 trillion or $432.29 billion in 2020 as shown in the data of the NBS and World Bank.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe latest growth, according to the NBS in its new report, makes three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\nIn the report, the NBS said: \u201cThe Q2, 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10 percent growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51 per cent recorded in Q1, 2021 year on year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen before the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70 per cent in 2021 compared to -2.18 per cent for the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, quarter on quarter, real GDP grew at -0.79 percent in Q2, 2021 compared to Q1, 2021, reflecting slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\n\u201cThe nominal GDP growth rate in Q2, 2021 was higher than -2.80 per cent growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic. The Q2, 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than the 12.25 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2021. For better clarity, the Nigerian economy has been classified broadly into the oil and non-oil sectors.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development yesterday, the immediate past Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf told THISDAY that the size of an economy \u201cmatters a lot.\u201d\n\nYusuf, an economist, and a leading private sector advocate, pointed out that the size of an economy \u201cindicates the inherent opportunities for investment, revenue, profit, job creation and the welfare of the people.\u201d\n\nHowever, the economist observed that the size of the economy \u201cis not an end in itself. Rather, it should be a means to an end. The quality of lives must be positively impacted.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, pointed out that economic inclusion \u201cis critical in ensuring an impactful economy. Nigeria and South Africa are the two biggest economies in Africa. Yet, the two economies are grappling with profound challenges around inequality, poverty, social discontent, and insecurity.\n\n\u201cAll of these are manifestations of the absence of inclusion and social dislocations. Only recently, the two countries witnessed looting and destruction on an unprecedented scale.\n\n\u201cAlthough the triggers were different, the events were reflections of the underlying social problems that existed in these two countries. The standard of living in many countries in Africa is far higher than what we have in the two leading economies of the continent.\u201d\n\nYusuf, therefore, challenged the governments of Nigeria and South Africa to design economic and social policies to fix these gaps, which according to him, would require a greater focus on investment in social infrastructures such as education, healthcare, and the environment.\n\nHe explained that high investment in social infrastructure \u201cimpacts significantly on people\u2019s welfare. Investment in economic infrastructure \u2013 roads, railways, or power \u2013 is critical as well. This would impact productivity, cost of production, inflation, and the general level of competitiveness of firms.\n\n\u201cThe macroeconomic management is also crucial to ensure that the economic fundamentals support investment and productivity. This should support low inflation, stable currency, and low-interest rates. The growth of small businesses is vital to the promotion of economic inclusion because of their number and spread across the country.\n\n\u201cAn investment-friendly policy, regulatory and institutional environment is imperative. Hostile regulatory and institutional environments undermine investors\u2019 confidence and impact negatively on the economy,\u201d Yusuf explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) expended N541.65 billion subsidy on petrol between February and July this year, a document detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for August 2021, has shown.\n\nThe document obtained by THISDAY showed that N25.374 billion was spent on what the corporation terms under-recovery or value shortfall in February, it was N60.39 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April.\n\nIt more than doubled to N126.298 billion in May, markedly reduced to N164.337 billion in June, and further came down to N103.286 billion in July.\n\nAs a consequence of the payment, the NNPC has been largely unable to fully remit its \u2018calendared projected monthly contribution of N209 billion to the joint account since February, with the worst case being in April when it remitted zero amount to FAAC.\n\nOn Friday, THISDAY reported that the corporation was again set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint federation account, being a combination of N175 billion subsidy sum and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, an improvement on the N47.162 billion in June, with the succeeding month\u2019s payment being about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, the net revenue to FAAC by the NNPC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June, and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nYear-to-date, the document showed that the NNPC had only been able to make a contribution of N349.254 billion to the three tiers of government with a huge deficit of N1.115 trillion.\n\nIn all, in July, as released on August, 16 local and international oil trading companies had dealings with the NNPC under the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase arrangement in 28 transactions in the month.\n\nNNPC\u2019s profit was N67.2 billion, with contributions from JV crude being N1.632 billion, domiciled crude being N31.73 billion, while miscellaneous income and domiciled gas were N27.11 billion and N6.795 billion respectively.\n\nIn terms of federal government priority projects, national domestic gas development gulped N2.52 billion during the month, gas infrastructure development cost N2.977 billion, and the Brass LNG gas supply project did not get any funding.\n\nIn addition, frontier exploration services gulped N2.975 billion, renewables consumed N885 million, total spending on pipeline security and maintenance was N7.352 billion, and refinery rehabilitation, the main payment for salaries and utilities, was N8.33 billion. Furthermore, N83 million was spent on the Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nOf all the cost centres during the month, only under-recovery and pipelines security were fully funded, leaving other projects like domestic gas financing, for instance, under-funded to the tune of N24.3 billion, gas infrastructure with a deficit of N17.853 billion, and frontier exploration by N14.652 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, N1.304 trillion has been deducted for recurrent and capital expenditures by the NNPC, according to the document, while total distribution plus miscellaneous hit N1.653 trillion in July. However, a deficit of N1.250 trillion remained hanging.\n\nVandalism of NNPC infrastructure continued as a breakdown of the pipeline and management cost of N3.659 billion indicated that N2.708 billion was for security maintenance, pipelines, and facilities repairs were N392.950 million, while the NNPC\u2019s strategic holding was N577.410 million.\n\nThe status of the NNPC\u2019s payment to its Joint Venture cash call arrears obligation has remained unchanged since May at $3.22 billion out of a total negotiated sum of $4.689 billion since 2016. The outstanding balance remained $1.464 billion since May this year.\n\nBut added to JV cost recovery and priority projects, the document revealed that the total distribution, made by the corporation in January was N195.624 billion, it was N191.194 billion in February and hit N224.589 billion in March.\n\nIn addition, it was to N156.366 in April, but again hit a high of N320.315 in May and was N295.396 and N270.405 billion in June and July respectively.\n\nIn June the corporation had continued its regime of deductions from the federation account withholding N117.4 billion from the three tiers of government.\n\nTwo months ago, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres and worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nThe national oil company stated that the under-recovery or subsidy that the government pays on the product every month had begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThis, it said was making the corporation unable to contribute fully to the national coffers, the federation account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the gains made from rising international oil prices.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, had also explained that with the exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre in June, maintaining that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nA THISDAY check-in July showed that the NNPC\u2019s payment to the federation account had declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "VERBATIM: What retired naval officer said on Channels TV about Boko Haram, NDA attack",
          "text": "Kunle Olawunmi, a retired commodore of the Nigerian Navy, is currently in the news following his recent comments on Nigeria\u2019s security challenges when he featured on Sunrise Daily, a programme on Channels Television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlawunmi, who is currently the head of the department of criminology and security studies at Chrisland University, Abeokuta, Ogun state, was said to have been declared wanted by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) after the interview, but the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has debunked the claim.\n\nSpeaking on the August 24 attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna, the retired naval officer commented on the need to improve Nigeria\u2019s security architecture across military formations, with particular focus on addressing insurgency by prosecuting persons accused of sponsoring acts of terrorism. Reproduced below is what he said, as listened to by TheCable.\n\nON THE NDA ATTACK\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy impression, I think, is just the impression of every Nigerian at this point. This is an aberration. I mean, you don\u2019t attack Nigerian Defence Academy and kill officers and get away with it. The last time I was in NDA was in 2017. I went to carry out an investigation by the minister of defence that wanted me to check what is going on with the training, and the security environment there.\n\n\u201cI remember I spent about a week at the NDA, with the commandant, and with the staff. But something struck me. And that was every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open, and everybody has access to come and pray in the mosque. I want to actually enjoin journalists to go to all military formations across the country on Friday by one o\u2019clock. You are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations.\n\n\u201cIf you go to Defence Headquarters \u2014 I served at Defence Headquarters as the deputy director, defence administration between 2015 and 2017. Throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors only twice because of the strict security architecture at the Defence Headquarters. But every Friday, the gate of Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and do Juma\u2019at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I\u2019ve served in military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural. People expect me to come here and start talking about kinetics, about operations, and so on. I\u2019ve been an operation commander all my life. I\u2019ve commanded warships, troops, men outside Nigeria and so on. But I\u2019m not going to come to your station to discuss kinetics. The problem is not kinetics. In 2017\u2026 2016, I\u2019m always a member of the security and intelligence brief at the Defence Headquarters. I told them \u2013 General Olonisakin then \u2013 that the challenge we have in this country cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nON ALLEGED SPONSORS OF BOKO HARAM INSURGENCY\n\n\u201cI told Olonisakin that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram and insurgency in Nigeria are the sponsors of that programme. It was beyond us, because the job we need to do is kinetics; fight, destroy places, resolve issues. But we cannot resolve issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know, that we know then.\n\n\u201cI was in the military intelligence and the Defence Headquarters\u2019 staff that I worked with know and that was how we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved that problem, because you need to arrest people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram. Why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them?\n\n\u201cIn April this year, the government said they have arrested 400 Bureau de Change (BDCs)-related people that were sponsoring Boko Haram. They told us. And Abu Dhabi also helped us to arrest few Nigerians. Why can\u2019t this government, if not that they are partisan, and part of the charade going on, why can\u2019t they bring these people out for trial?\n\n\u201cThe people I mentioned that are in government are not these ones that they just arrested. You remember this Boko Haram issue started since 2012 and I was in the military intelligence that time. We arrested those people. It\u2019s my organisation that actually conducted interrogation and interview and they mentioned names.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government now that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now. Some of them are in the senate. Some of them are in Aso Rock. Why should a government try to cause this kind of embarrassment?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe truth I\u2019m telling you now, not about sentiment, is that there are groups of people that feel that this country should be Islamised. This is a fact, except you want me to start mentioning names of people in this government that we have interrogated. I was a member of an interrogation team and I\u2019ve interrogated a very high-ranking member of this government in 2007, 2008 on issue of Boko Haram. I interrogated him. He\u2019s in the government right now. And what was the issue? Boko Haram. And this senior officer was actually let go, because he was found culpable. But right now, he\u2019s in the government.\n\nON EFFORTS MADE BY GOVERNMENT TO TACKLE INSURGENCY\n\n\u201cWhen you have a problem at policy level, strategic level or operational level, what you need to do is identify the centre of gravity of the problem and attack it. What they (the federal government) are doing is not attacking the centre of gravity of the problem of Boko Haram and insurgency.\n\n\u201cSo if the president is buying Super Tucano (jets), changing service chiefs, that is not the solution. We are looking at the wrong side. It\u2019s not kinetics, it\u2019s politics. The centre of gravity is what they should look at and it is the sponsor of Boko Haram and bandits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was surprised at the tremendous information at the DSS. There have so much information presently at DSS about what I am talking about. But if a fish is going to get spoilt, it is going to start getting spoilt from the head. The DSS will not do anything except the commander-in-chief\u2019s body language shows that this is the direction I want to go. That is what the problem is.\n\n\u201cThe DSS has tremendous information. By the time 2023 is here and somebody take over and wants to undo some of these evils that I have seen in this country, you will be surprised names that the DSS will bring out. They have the information, there is nothing I want to say here that they don\u2019t have. The Defence Headquarters has the solution for the kinetics aspect, they do. I am not going to come here to advise them. I worked with them and they are still there.\n\n\u201cThe chief of naval staff was in the intelligence with me, we were together in Defence Intelligence Agency, that is Vice Admiral Gambo. I know these people are good, they know what to do. It\u2019s not that they have problems. It has to do with politics, the sponsors, people that feel this country should be Islamised.\u201d\n\n\u2018END GAME IS TO TURN NIGERIA TO A TALIBAN COUNTRY\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen you want to look at these type of challenges, what you do is go through what we call the intelligence circle. When you do the processing and analysis before dissemination point, you discover that the end game for them is to just turn this country to a Taliban type of country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mindset and anything goes. In other words, 10 percent casualty, 20 percent casualty is allowed in trying to achieve the end game of Islamising this country.\n\n\u201cThe sponsors of Boko Haram and the bandits are the problems. And Defence Headquarters, army headquarters, naval headquarters, and the air force cannot do anything about that. Buhari has to do something about it.\n\n\u201cThe Interpol has the list of those people sponsoring Boko Haram. I worked with Interpol. If they don\u2019t know, they should ask. The government of Dubai have the list of those people during the trial, names were mentioned; they have the list. The government also said they arrested 400 sponsors of Boko Haram, why should a government not try those people and bring peace, harmony and safety to this nation. Why wouldn\u2019t a government do that?\u201d",

          "text": "Six days, four deaths; these are arguably not the best of times for the Nigerian creative industry following the demise of some of the biggest names in the sector in less than a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt all started on Monday. As it\u2019s the case with deaths, no one saw the passing away of Yusuf Grillo, the legendary Nigerian visual artist, coming.\n\nGrillo, famous for his stained glass paintings, died of COVID-19 complications at the age of 80 in the early hours of August 23.\n\nHis death had elicited multiple reactions as people took to social media to pay tributes to the artist who is considered one of Nigeria\u2019s outstanding and academically trained painters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut barely four days after Grillo\u2019s death, Victor Olaotan, the lead actor of \u2018Tinsel\u2019, the popular Nigerian soap opera, also passed away.\n\nThe veteran Nollywood personality breathed his last on Thursday, August 26, after a prolonged illness caused by a ghastly road accident in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Olaotan had sought financial aid for medical treatment outside Nigeria to avert the amputation of his legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaotan\u2019s death had also come as a shock to many movie lovers who witnessed his heroics on the screen during his heydays.\n\nHowever, the dust over the news of the \u2018Tinsel\u2019 actor\u2019s demise had yet to fully settled when that of Prince Ifeanyi Dike, another movie star, surfaced.\n\nThe film star, who was the board of trustees (BoT) chairman for the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), died on Friday.\n\nHis death had come on the same day when Rachel Oniga, the Nollywood actress who passed away in July, was buried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, Dike\u2019s death sparked reactions with colleagues and movie lovers penning tributes to celebrate his illustrious career as an actor.\n\nAbubakar Yakubu, national secretary of the AGN, had described Dike\u2019s death as \u201cdevastating\u201d, citing the circumstances surrounding it.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how these things happen! Today, we buried Rachel Oniga. Victor died too. Just as we\u2019re trying to get over that, Ifeanyi Dike followed. It\u2019s a very devastating moment for all of us. We\u2019ve been crying since,\u201d he had told TheCable Lifestyle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very bad mood. He\u2019s our BoT chairman and an entirely good colleague of ours. It\u2019s sad, really. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few hours after, the country\u2019s creative industry was again struck by the news of the death of Victor Uwaifo, the veteran Nigerian highlife.\n\nUwaifo, better known as \u2018Guitar Boy\u2019, breathed his last on Saturday after reportedly battling a yet-to-be-identified illness.\n\nJust like the other entertainers, his death sent social media into a frenzy as his colleagues and music lovers celebrated his legacies in the country\u2019s music landscape.\n\nUntil his demise, Nwaifo was also a writer, sculptor, and instrumentalist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won numerous awards and recognition including the National Merit Honours of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) in 1983.\n\nFor years to come, the outgoing week would be remembered as one the Nigerian creative industry lost for big names to the cold hands of death.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. It later pivoted to a model similar to MaxAB\u2019s own, pulling out of Ivory Coast and Togo to focus on growing its network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco.\n\nThe acquisition will see MaxAB accelerate its expansion into the Maghreb market \u2013 Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 empowered by WaystoCap\u2019s expertise in the region.\n\nWaystoCap is the second African YC-backed company to exit over the past year after Paystack got acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last October.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa,\u201d Co-Founder and CEO at MaxAB, Belal El-Megharbel, said on the company\u2019s expansion and the synergies with WaystoCap.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting.\u201d\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition will now see more than 70,000 retailers supplied with essential food and groceries across multiple markets.\n\nNiama El Bassunie, CEO & Founder of WaystoCap who will take on the position of the managing director at MaxAB Morocco added: \u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.\u201d\n\nFor MaxAB, the Maghreb market is a new territory and this new strategic acquisition will position the expanded team to be North Africa\u2019s leading business-to-business eCommerce platform for retailers and suppliers.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced that it will resume issuing visas to all tourists fully vaccinated against the coronavirus from Monday.\n\nThis development comes amid a drop in coronavirus infections in the country after it reported less than 1,000 cases per day last week for the first time in months.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s decision to reopen its doors to tourists from all countries was taken in order \u201cto achieve sustainable recovery and economic growth\u201d, the official WAM news agency reported on Saturday.\n\nThose eligible would have to be fully inoculated with one of the Covid-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, which include AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac.\n\nRead also: Nigerian fresh graduates and labour market challenges\n\n\u201cThe decision applies to citizens of all countries, including those arriving from previously banned countries,\u201d WAM said.\n\n\u201cPassengers arriving on tourist visas must take a mandatory PCR test at the airport,\u201d it added.\n\nThe UAE is made up of seven emirates including the capital Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nWhile living in the country has largely returned to normal amid the Covid pandemic, it continues to enforce strict rules on wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nDubai was last year counting on the six-month Dubai Expo 2020 \u2014 delayed a year by the health crisis and now set to open in October \u2013 to attract millions of visitors and boost the economy.\n\nHeavily reliant on tourism, the emirate was one of the first destinations to open its doors to travellers, accepting tourists in July last year, just a few months after the pandemic took hold.\n\nAbu Dhabi, meanwhile, has been more cautious, opening up to some visitors only in December.\n\nDubai had imposed levels of travel restrictions, forcing travellers to opt for other destinations.\n\nSince March, scheduled flights between Nigeria and the UAE have been stopped following a diplomatic row over COVID-19 protocol.\n\nThe UAE authorities had instructed Nigerian travellers at the Lagos and Abuja airports to take another PCR test on arrival in Dubai.\n\nBut Hadi Sirika, the minister of aviation, criticised the decision and termed it \u201cdiscriminatory profiling\u201d of Nigerian travellers.",

          "title": "Wanted: Courageous Nigerian soldiers",
          "text": "In the early 80s and late 90s when the military was in power, many parents wanted their children to be soldiers because of the orderly manner the military used to go about their activities and the general aura around soldiers then.\n\nThen, the Nigerian Defence Academy Kaduna was the go-to place and the dream of many school leavers, particularly those who desired to pursue a career in the military.\n\nAt that time, the news that someone has been offered admission into NDA was seen by his friends as though he was going to heaven.\n\nNigerian soldiers were highly respected by their counterparts and civilians alike, across Africa because of their strength, discipline and high level of professionalism.\n\nAt that time, every soldier, officer and recruit, wanted to fight in troubled zones in West Africa, the continent and foreign engagements also.\n\nTo further underscore the points, apart from Lt-Gen. Arnold Quainoo, a Ghanaian force commander of Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), Nigerian high ranking military officers have led the West African multilateral armed forces from September 1990 to late 2000.\n\nRead Also: Bandits attack Nigeria\u2019s Defence Academy, kill two, abduct one\n\nThe long hold on ECOMOG leadership was because of Nigeria\u2019s tested and trusted strength, discipline and commitment.\n\nThe Liberian Civil War of 1989\u201396, The Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991\u20132002 and The Guinea-Bissau Civil War of June 7, 1998 to May 10, 1999, were among the major feats of ECOMOG led by Nigerian soldiers.\n\nSadly, if war breaks out in any West African country today, Nigeria will not be looked upon to lead, Nigerian soldiers will also not be willing to volunteer to fight, as ECOWAS and other African countries may have become disappointed with the way Nigeria is being out-gunned by non-state actors and, who are creating a perpetual state of unease.\n\nMany are wondering what has happened to the once-revered Nigerian soldiers who commanded ECOMOG and led others to fight their way into the many-sided civil wars, forcibly holding the warring factions apart and restoring peace in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and in other war zones.\n\nAt present, Nigeria seems under siege by terrorists and gunmen, a sad situation worsened by the helplessness of the military, which the defenseless citizens look up to save them from frequent attacks, but are daily disappointed at the soldiers, who are also under attacks.\n\nFrom kidnapping innocent school girls in Borno, burning down villages, sacking residents, and taking over more territories, the terrorists, especially Boko Haram, have truly challenged the Nigerian military, which couldn\u2019t repeat its feats in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nRead Also: NDA attack \u2013 A minute\u2019s silence for Nigeria\n\nTaking advantage of the battered soldiers and lack of political will by the government to fight them or engage foreign help, the terrorists are growing every day with deadly assaults on the Nigerian nation and her sovereignty.\n\nSpeaking on the recent attack by gunmen at NDA Kaduna, a serving soldier, who pleaded for anonymity, said that the Nigerian soldier is still the strongest in Africa, but that the morale is very low because of the poor welfare package, poor treatment experienced by families of deceased soldiers, unlikely ambush by terrorists, ethnic and religious sentiments among other challenges, have discouraged them from giving their best.\n\n\u201cYou cannot enter any military facility and attack freely if there is no insider. We are trained to kill and to dispel any form of threat, but when we fail to do so, then there is a reason. If you address the reason, we will fight to finish,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Yakubu Ali, a Nigerian war veteran, insisted that the Nigerian soldier is still the best on the continent, but needs fairness in treatment and good welfare.\n\n\u201cI have seen war, fought war and retired from war. I was in Liberia and Guinea-Bissau before I retired to Biu in Plateau State, my home town. What we need is to make the soldiers happy, assure them of their welfare and ensure justice because you cannot send some to die and others to live and expect results. Look out what is happening in Plateau now. I cannot be wearing my uniform when my relatives are being killed in their homes and you expect me to be happy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retired soldier noted that the Nigerian military is capable of defeating Boko Haram, flushed out bandits and kidnappers in six months if the leadership is focused on professionalism, enforce discipline, raise morale of their men, insist and engage government on workable measures and also getting help if need be.\n\n\u201cOf course, the military will not regain power again, so let\u2019s leave politics to civilians and do our professional job; we can threaten the government if it compromises on security measures like the pardon of repentant Boko Haram. The military is not safe now because these fellows have insiders and they know them better than they think,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, the problem is leadership and not the soldiers.\n\n\u201cThere is a popular saying that \u2018a stitch in time saves nine\u2019. Nigeria is suffering in the hands of terrorists today because it refused to take the right action when the insecurity issue was just building. If the government had been firm on flushing out insurgence without playing politics with it, many dead, homeless and the economy would have been saved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe security expert, who has been following political and social unrest in Africa in the last two decades, insisted that Nigerian soldiers are still very strong and reliable, but need good welfare and the right leadership devoid of ethnic and religious sentiments to deliver the expected result.\n\n\u201cIf you hear the testimonies of some Nigerian soldiers who absconded from the war against Boko Haram in Borno State, you will understand why the terrorists seem to be having the upper hand. Nobody wants to die in the face of compromise and ambush by your own system,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, the Nigerian military is strong enough to dispel attacks on the entire West Africa, but there is an issue of trust.\n\nSpeaking further, the retired Navy officer decried that many junior ranks, who are usually the ones facing the fire and attacks from terrorists have noticed different sides and counter commands due to growing religious and ethnic sentiments, which shouldn\u2019t find their way in the military for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cSoldiers are human beings, if someone from Benue hears that his village is sacked and probably parents killed, he cannot concentrate on his primary assignment, whether it is fighting terrorists, bandits or safeguarding Aso Rock\u201d, he said.\n\nHowever, many observers think that the military is the only institution that can save the country from terrorists\u2019 attacks; hence government should do everything to ensure professionalism is maintained, with no interference, while the military rejigs the system to ensure good welfare packages to boost an average soldier\u2019s morale and fairness in career progression and promotion.\n\nIn conclusion, they insisted that no matter how sophisticated the jet fighter is, if the pilot is not happy, he may likely hit wrong targets or even crash the jet.\n\n\u2018Powerful elements bent on islamising Nigeria\u2019\n\nAngered by the audacity of the bandits, the raging low-grade war in Nigeria, which appears to be defying every strategy, Kunle Olawunmi, a retired Naval officer, said some sponsors of terrorist groups were bent on turning Nigeria into a country where the Taliban would reign supreme. He aired his views during a television programme.\n\nOlawunmi alleged that the high level of nepotism and unwillingness to deal decisively with sponsors of Boko Haram were not helping the fight.\n\nHe recalled how some Boko Haram suspects, who were arrested by the military mentioned some of their sponsors, adding that current governors and senators were among those financing terrorism in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat Buhari administration should do is to tag this group as terrorists not bandits. Those that invaded the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) just wanted to send across a message,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that there are hardliners in this country who just want to Islamise Nigeria and they do not care how many people are killed to achieve their aim.\n\nAsk what the intelligence agencies and all the nation\u2019s security agencies are doing since they know these individuals, and why they have not picked them up, the retired officer said they may be looking at the body language of the Commander-in-Chief, as according to him, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing they can do except the President gives his approval.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the bandits who perpetrated the attacks on NDA were conversant with the environment. He also disclosed that some Cadets had been abducted before now from the NDA and that ransom was paid to free them.\n\nHe also said that the abducted cadets said the place they were kept was not far from the premises of NDA as they were said to have narrated that they were hearing the parade going on at the complex from their captors\u2019 den.\n\nThe retired Naval officer blamed socio-cultural issues as being responsible for some of the attacks being recorded by the bandits. He said that the porous nature of military facilities on Fridays, when the gates are thrown wide open for all manner of people to enter for Jumat prayer, must have also helped some bandits to profile the environment. He said that such level of access to all manner of people was dangerous for security.\n\n\u201cThey had enough time to carry out surveillance as they go in and out of the NDA and other Defence premises. Every Friday during Jumat, barriers are removed for all manner of persons to move in and out in the name of prayer because of socio-cultural issues.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience of 35 years of military service; who had worked with many past heads of state, I know that there are groups of people in this country that want to see that this country is islamised,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the danger of insecurity and the level of governance in the country at the moment, he said: \u201cWe have been set back more than 60 yrs. We are moving towards the precipice. Whoever is coming back to lead has a serious work to do. Polarisation, nepotism that I have never seen in my life are going on. This is the worst situation I have seen in my life in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the explanation that the officers who were supposed to monitor the CCTV allegedly slept off, the retired Naval officer said: \u201cWhen it comes to tactical operation, the most important element is surprise. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they slept off; whether the people were agile or not. But at the time they struck, they knew they can achieve some elements of surprise. Even if after 30 minutes of their invasion of that place; it will take a lot to respond to that kind of attack. So, there should be no blame or start looking for who to blame.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI conducted an attack in Niger; and Angola. No matter how fortified an environment is; no matter how foreign it is; if you can achieve the element of surprise, you can win. I know the security architecture there; even if by that time, 1a.m., they want to respond to that; I know the process; the weapons are in the armory; you need to go and open the armory where the arms are and start signing, and the bandits will not allow that to happen. They will continue to fire; they will continue to fire; they will continue to follow up and make sure that you will not respond; and any response, you are going to be caught by bullets. So, it is not about what happened at 1.a.m. it is about what has been happening for the past two years, three years when these people have been having access; unfettered access to NDA; and they have carried out their surveillance and they know the right time to strike.\n\n\u201cIt is about what happened in two, three years back; it is not about now. Anybody that wants to investigate this issue should not look at now; he should look at what has happened in the last two years, three years, how porous the place has been and try to investigate it,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtom not amused by State of the Nation\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue, whose state has borne the brunt of herdsmen\u2019s onslaught, wondered why Abuja seems to be dragging foot rather than wielding the stick that it truly has.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, Mr. President has a mindset. I have spoken to him personally. His outing publicly also confirms what he told me. Mr. President believes that for peace to reign in Nigeria there must be provisions for grazing areas; and according to him; Mr. President feels that those grazing areas that were enacted, especially in the Northern state, and cattle routes, those who have encroached on them, should be relocated,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI took this up with him; and that was why I told him that we are no longer in the 60\u2019s because the population has outgrown the land that we have. Land is not increasing. I told him that as at today, we have over 200 million people compared to less than 40 million we had in 1950. So, there is no how we can talk about an open grazing. In my state; for instance, there is no land for open grazing, but there is land for ranching which is the global best practice. If we accept this, this problem will be over. This is why most of my colleagues; in fact, all my colleagues irrespective of their party affiliation from the south accepted that the way to go is ranching. Most of the states in the north have also accepted that ranching is the way to go.\n\n\u201cWe recommended to Mr. President and his handlers, that just like we subscribed Agriculture and provide subsidy for fertilizer and all the same thing for herdsman because ranching can be a little but expensive compared to open grazing. We can help these our herders by ensuring that they have subsidy in terms of water we provide because their cattle take a lot of water in terms of feeds that we provide. And we can devise so many other ways, and I can assure you that.\n\n\u201cI am a farmer and I know the challenges that we are talking about. I have a ranch and I know the challenges accompanying this; but at the same time; I know the potential that we have. This is an another way that we can provide millions of opportunities, job and also empower our people, who for now when they cultivate rice and harvest the straw and all that are wasted. But these can be turned into feeds. This is what I use in my ranch. I have been saying that; we can do all these,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtom, who wondered why the President has refused to buy into what he thought could be a lasting solution, said: \u201cI was not too surprised, but I was disappointed that after the entire country is talking about ranching, he is talking about open grazing. I think Mr. President is pushing me to believe that what they say about him that he has hidden agenda in this country is true. It is true because it is very clear that he wants to Islamise Nigeria. But he is not first Fulani president that Nigeria has had. Shagari was a Fulani president; Yar\u2019Adua was a Fulani president. They were the best president in the country has ever had.\n\n\u201cGo back and check in 2015 what did he say? Human rights issues: He talked about press freedom; he talked about the economy; he talked about corruption; he talked about security. Tell me one thing that Mr. President has achieved. Well, he has achieved some level of success in some sectors, but truly; these prominent things that are of concern to Nigerians and we are all worried, tell me where Mr. President has come out to address this matter; is it corruption, we are worst in the history of this country,\u201d he further said.\n\nTime to show leadership \u2013 Group\n\nDecrying the killings and terrorist attacks across the country, Enough is Enough Nigeria, a non-governmental organisation, in its latest newsletter, urged Mr. President to \u201cWake up and smell the coffee!\u201d\n\nWondering \u201cWhat is a Life Worth in Nigeria?\u201d the group recounted that \u201cOn August 24, 2021, terrorists attacked the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) in Afaka, Kaduna State, killing 2 officers (Lt. Cdr. Wulah and Flt. Lt. CM Okoronkwo), and abducting Major Christopher Datong. According to SBM Intelligence, this is the fourth security breach of the NDA in the last three years, including an incident in late 2019 where up to 150 cows were rustled from the grounds of the NDA.\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cRemember, the NDA is located just a few metres away from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State, where 39 students were abducted by terrorists on March 11, 2021. Thankfully, all 39 students have since been released.\n\n\u201cOn the same day that the NDA was attacked, 35 people were reportedly killed in Yelwa Zangam, a community in Jos North LGA of Plateau State.\u201d\n\nRallying Nigerians, the group said: \u201cActive citizens, where is the outrage? These problems are not going to fix themselves, except we all stay demanding. S\u00f2r\u00f2 S\u00f3k\u00e8 o! Enough is Enough!\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigerian soldiers were highly respected by their counterparts and civilians alike, across Africa because of their strength, discipline and high level of professionalism.\nAlso speaking, Yakubu Ali, a Nigerian war veteran, insisted that the Nigerian soldier is still the best on the continent, but needs fairness in treatment and good welfare.\nAccording to Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, the problem is leadership and not the soldiers.\nFor Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, the Nigerian military is strong enough to dispel attacks on the entire West Africa, but there is an issue of trust.\nThose that invaded the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) just wanted to send across a message,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The bandits who kidnapped scores of Islamic school pupils in Niger State beat them daily and threatened to kill them if their families did not pay the ransom demanded, some of the students have said.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported the kidnap of over 90 pupils on May 30 at the Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nOne of the pupils died in custody while the remaining 90 were freed on Friday after spending about 88 days in the custody of the kidnappers.\n\nSome of the pupils spoke about their ordeal in interviews Sunday with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe Ordeal\n\nOne of the released pupils, Zuwaira Isa, said they trekked for almost four days in the forest before reaching a final destination.\n\n\u201cThe little ones amongst us were lifted on the bandits\u2019 motorcycles throughout the movement.\n\n\u201cWe were fed with rice though not enough to satisfy us. We were subjected to severe beatings both in the morning and evening and they threatened to kill us if our parents did not pay our ransom,\u201d Miss Isa said.\n\nAnother one, Hauwa Musa, said: \u201cThey usually beat us and threatened to kill us and dump our bodies in the bush if our parents did not pay the ransom.\u201d\n\nMiss Musa also said the bandits were giving them a small food ration and one pure water sachet for two abductees.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nShe, however, said that the incident would not deter her from continuing with her educational pursuit, adding, \u201dI am so much eager to go back to school.\u201d\n\nHow I secured their release \u2013 Headteacher\n\nAlso speaking, the Head Teacher of the school, Alhassan Garba, who also spoke to NAN and other journalists in Minna, the state capital, said all the released pupils have been reunited with their parents.\n\n\u201cI personally supervised the handover of the pupils to their parents on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll the parents were happy to have their children back and willing to allow them to continue to acquire their education in the same school,\u201d Mr Garba said.\n\nHe said that the management of the school would soon meet with the community to work out the modalities for the reopening of the institution which had been closed for three months now.\n\nHe said the Chairman of Rafi Local Government Area, Ismail Modibi, councilors and other stakeholders would soon deliberate on various forms of security measures to be adopted if the school resumed normal academic activities.\n\nThe headteacher said that he personally went to pick the pupils at a village called Gwaska in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHe said the abductors of the pupils after collecting ransom insisted that he must personally go there and pick the children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI had to take a bike from Birnin Gwari town to a particular destination where I picked the children for onward journey back to Minna,\u201d he said.\n\nParents Speak\n\nMeanwhile, one of the mothers of the released children, Rabi Abubakar, said she was happy to have her two kids back.\n\nMrs Abubakar said she paid an undisclosed amount of money to get her children back, but vowed to allow them to continue with their Islamiyya education in the school.\n\nShe said that the incident would not affect the educational pursuit of the children.\n\n\u201cIslamic and western education is the only legacy any responsible family will leave behind for their children and I am determined to do that to enable them to be responsible citizens.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered too much in the hands of the bandits but our Allah will surely punish any person or group of people that had a hand in the incident and for causing untold hardships to us and the innocent kids,\u201d she said.\n\nHabiba Aliyu, whose five children are among the freed pupils, was full of praises to God.\n\n\u201cWhen we learnt that the abducted children have regained freedom from their kidnappers, we were all happy and full of praises to God.\n\n\u201cWe prayed and fasted, seeking God\u2019s intervention for the safe return of our kids,\u201d Mrs Aliyu said.\n\nIdris Umar, another parent of some of the released pupils, also stated that the incident would not discourage them from sending their children to Islamic schools in the town.\n\nMr Umar said they had already planned to secure the school and other schools in the community.\n\n\u201cWe have put in place sensitive security measures that will prevent future occurrences of the incident as our children resume normal academic activities in the school.\n\n\u201cWe, the parents, have collectively agreed not to be discouraged by the recent activities of the bandits in preventing our children to acquire Islamic and western education.\n\n\u201cWe will allow and encourage the children to realise that seeking knowledge is the best thing to happen in this world and the hereafter,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Eligible customer regulation is still in force on eligible customer transactions \u2013 NERC",
          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), says its attention has been drawn to news articles trending on both the electronic and print media reporting that the Eligible Customer Regulations (\u201cECR\u201d) issued by the Commission in 2018 has been suspended. The articles further reported that the Transmission Company of Nigeria Plc (\u201cTCN\u201d) has been directed by the Commission to disconnect certain customers as a consequence of the suspension of the said regulations.\n\nThe Commission, in a statement by Usman Abba Arabi, its General Manager, Public Affairs Department, noted that the Eligible Customer Regulations (\u201cECR\u201d) has NOT been suspended and at no time has the Commission issued a directive for discontinuation of service to any customer. The ECR was developed and approved by the Commission, pursuant to a declaration made by the Honourable Ministry of Power as provided under section 27 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (\u201cEPSRA\u201d). The regulations provide for conditions for the grant of eligibility status by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission further issued the guidelines for filing for competitive transition charge (\u201cCTC\u201d) to account for loss of revenue by DisCos in compliance with section 28 of the Act. In this regard, electricity consumers across the country that comply with the provisions of the Eligible Customer Regulations may avail themselves of the bilateral contracting opportunities presented by the intent of the provisions in the EPSRA and the ECR.\n\nThe Commission has noted references to our letter to the Market Operator and being referred to as a directive for discontinuation of supply to certain customers. We wish to state that this was a straightforward directive of the industry regulator restraining the TCN from recognising unauthorised eligible customer transactions in the market settlement statement without the prior approval of the Commission. The Commission further directed all unauthorised EC transactions to revert to BILLING by the distribution companies (\u201cDisCos\u201d) operating in the franchise area where the customers are located but without disruption in supply until the customer is conferred with eligibility status pursuant to the requirement of the\n\nECR. It is important to note that whereas the majority of these customers pursuing EC status have always been served through 132kV transmission lines, the billing of the customers resides with the distribution companies (\u201cDisCos\u201d) unless a customer elects to purchase energy under the framework of the ECR.\n\nON SEEKING ELIGIBLE CUSTOMER STATUS\n\nThe Eligible Customer Regulations was designed to provide a very simple process for securing eligibility status from the Commission for customer whose consumption is in excess of the minimum threshold of 2MWh/h over a period of one month. The key conditions for the grant of the EC status are as follows:\n\n\u2013 Evidence of no indebtedness to DisCos: An eligible customer applicant is obligated to show that it is not indebted to the existing supplier before it can be conferred with eligibility to switch a supplier of electricity. Many of the applicants for eligibility status are, however, unable to provide this evidence due to a pending settlement dispute with their respective DisCos.\n\n\u2013 The supplier (GenCo OR trading licensee) to the potential eligible customer should possess an unencumbered generation capacity to sell to other customers.\n\n\u2013 Evidence of an agreement with the supplier of last resort in compliance with sections 37 and 38 of ECR. This is to ensure a continuity of supply to the eligible customer, in the event of a disruption by the contracted GenCo.\n\nThe aforementioned conditions provided in the light-handed EC regulations issued by the Commission are designed to preserve the structure and orderliness of the electricity market while opening opportunities for competition and better service for consumers. Electricity consumers meeting the consumption threshold of 2MWh/h wishing to avail themselves of the opportunity of purchasing electricity from sources other than DisCos are encouraged to apprise themselves of the guiding regulations of the industry and not rely on the presumption of compliance. GenCos wishing to sell electricity to consumers under the eligible customer framework are mandatorily required to possess an unencumbered generation capacity for sale to other consumers.\n\nThe public is further invited to note that a number of eligible customer application before the Commission are stalled by the inability of either the applicants or their potential suppliers to fulfil the conditions precedent for grant of eligibility in compliance with sections 5, 6, 23, 37 and 38, and schedules 1A & 1B of ECR. These conditions are easily within the reach and control of the applicants and the potential suppliers. Other reasons constraining the grant of eligible customer status to some major consumers of electricity include various litigations and/or objections to applications filed with the Commission.\n\nThe Commission is committed to opening up the electricity supply industry for competition and new investments. We are committed to granting timely approvals to all applicants who have met the conditions for eligibility status as provided in the eligible customer regulations. We will, however, continue to be firm on orderliness and compliance with the regulations, Order and operating codes guiding the electricity industry.\n\nEmail: [email protected] [email protected];\n\nlike us on and visit our website www.nercng.org",

          "text": "Three residents of Maryland, United States, face indictment for attempting to illegally export arms and ammunition to Nigeria.\n\nThe Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Maryland said the suspects allegedly exported arms and ammunition without obtaining export licenses, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act.\n\nThe announcement, release on Friday, states:\n\nA federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging three Maryland men for the federal charges of conspiracy, violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act, related to the export of firearms and ammunition from the United States to Nigeria.\n\nCharged in the indictment, which was returned late yesterday, are:\n\nWilson Nuyila Tita, age 45, of Owings Mills, Maryland;\n\nEric Fru Nji, age 40, of Fort Washington, Maryland; and\n\nWilson Che Fonguh, age 39, of Bowie, Maryland.\n\nThe indictment was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; and Special Agent in Charge Timothy Jones of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Baltimore Field Division.\n\nAccording to the four-count indictment, from at least November 2017 through July 19, 2019, the defendants conspired with each other and with others to export from the United States to Nigeria defense articles and items identified on the United States Munitions List (\u201cUSML\u201d) and the Commerce Control List (\u201cCCL\u201d) without first obtaining export licenses.\n\nThe defendants also allegedly conspired to conceal from the United States that those items were being shipped from the Port of Baltimore in Maryland to Nigeria and at least one other location in Africa. The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly contributed funds for the purchase of firearms, ammunition, reloading materials and other equipment for shipping overseas. The indictment alleges that the defendants and their co-conspirators communicated about their efforts and plans to ship weapons and ammunitions using an on-line encrypted messaging application and code words in order to conceal their activities.\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the defendants and other conspirators concealed the firearms, ammunition, rifle scopes, and other items in heavily wrapped packages and duffle bags, and inside sealed compressor units, placing those items into a shipping container destined for Nigeria without obtaining the requisite licenses from the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Further, as part of the conspiracy, one of the co-conspirators allegedly caused the submission of electronic export information to the U.S. government for the container which listed materially false information as to the identity of the exporter and the intermediate and ultimate consignee, as well as the ultimate destination of the container\u2019s contents.\n\nSpecifically, the indictment alleges that on January 17, 2019, the defendants and their co-conspirators exported, attempted to export, or caused to be exported to Nigeria articles on the USML the export of which was controlled under the Arms Export Control Act, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of State, specifically: 38 semi-automatic firearms; over 35,000 rounds of ammunition; and 44 magazines. On that same day, the defendants allegedly exported to Nigeria one Bushnell Trophy Rifle Optic and one Burris AR Rifle Scope, the export of which were controlled under the Commerce Control List, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Finally, the indictment alleges that the defendants transported 28 firearms with obliterated serial numbers, including 18 rifles.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants each face a mandatory sentence of five years in federal prison for the conspiracy; a maximum of 20 years in federal prison each for violating the Arms Export Control Act and for violating the Export Control Reform Act; and a maximum of five years in federal prison for transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. The defendants are each expected to have an initial appearance this afternoon in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas M. DiGirolamo beginning at 3:00 p.m.\n\nAn indictment is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.\n\nSeven defendants have been charged in related cases and of those six have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.\n\nActing United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended HSI and the ATF for their work in the investigation. Mr. Lenzner recognized the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement; U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service; Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Naval Criminal Investigative Service; and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their contributions to the investigation. Acting U.S. Attorney Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathleen O. Gavin, who is prosecuting the federal case.",

Why did you leave us? \u201cProf Sir Victor Uwaifo has gone to rest\n\nBlack Saturday for me nooow. \u201cOne week now after collaborating with me.\u201d\n\nAlso, confirming the sad news to Sunday Vanguard, Chief Tony Okoroji, Chairman , Copyrights Society of Nigeria, COSON, said he was dumbfounded as he needed to get a clearer picture of what happened to the legendary singer.\n\n\u201cVictor Uwaifo is not just a friend to me, he was a man I respected so much. I cannot say much now because I need to know what happened to him, \u201c Okoroji said.\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the family said the guitarist died after a brief illness.\n\nUwaifo was the first musician in Nigeria to be awarded the National Merit Honours of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON).\n\nHe was also the first Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism in Nigeria.\n\nBorn in Benin on March 1, 1941, Uwaifo was one of the foremost highlife musicians in Nigeria. He was trained sculptor, philosopher, poet and musical instrument inventor. His \u2018Joromi\u2019, hit song released in 1965, won for Nigeria the first Gold Disc Record ever to come out of the continent of Africa in a competitive world. Uwaifo is the first Benin man to receive the Nigerian National Honours; Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) in 1983, for his contributions to creativity and industry.\n\nHe was appointed and sworn-in as Justice of the Peace (JP) 1990. He is also the first and foremost Honourable Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism in Nigeria (Edo State), former lecturer in the Department of Fine and Applied Arts, University of Benin. He was honoured with an award in 2018 by the Association of Nigerian Musicologists for his outstanding music performance and leadership.\n\nHe was the Silverbird Man of the Year 2015 and honourary Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters, the highest literary academic body in Nigeria. Education: National Diploma (Graphics},Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, 1963, BA Hon (First Class), 1995, Masters degree (MFA) sculpture, 1997, Ph.D (Visual Arts), University of Benin, Nigeria. Project Title: Production of Architectural Sculpture in Nigeria: A Re-Invention of Ancient Benin Royal Altar Pieces into Contemporary Art Using Synthetic Polymer Materials\n\nUwaifo stands out today, intellectually sound both in mind and body as the most educated performing music icon in the world and the most read contemporary superstar still relevant over 50 years on stage till date. He has over 600 songs and 100 records to his credit with 8 gold and 2 silver awards. Each record is music of serious research and philosophical work equivalent to academic journal. He\u2019s a member of the Performing Rights Society of London (PRS), a trustee of Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN) and Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON). In 2016, Victor Uwaifo was inducted into the Grammy Award Museum in Los Angelis, USA. He has inspired generations of musicians in Nigeria and beyond and still counting.\n\nIn a WhatsApp chat with Vanguard during the celebration of his 80th birthday, Uwaifo described Joromi as the evergreen song which brought him international prominence.\n\nJoromi, composed in the singer\u2019s local dialect, was a five-minute track, and had for its solo, a mastery of skills on a variety of musical instruments including the electric guitar with an accompaniment of percussion and the electric piano.\n\nUwaifo also made use of vocals in making beats, which added more flavour to the song. The song, based on a folktale of the ancient Bini people tells the story of an undefeated warrior, named Joromi who had wrestled and defeated rivals until he was the ultimate warrior on earth. Without any more rivals, he decided to take the battle to the afterlife. Against the counsel of the elders, the fearsome Joromi engaged in battle with a warrior from the afterlife. This personal quest led to his end as he neither returned nor did the people of Bini till this day hear any news about him.\n\nHowever, 52 years after \u2018Joromi\u2019 ruled the airwaves, Uwaifo still regards the song as his greatest hit till date.\n\nLittle wonder, the living legend once sued singer Simi for N50 million for using the word \u2018Joromi\u2019 in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.

Why did you leave us? \u201cProf Sir Victor Uwaifo has gone to rest\n\nBlack Saturday for me nooow. \u201cOne week now after collaborating with me.\u201d\n\nAlso, confirming the sad news to Sunday Vanguard, Chief Tony Okoroji, Chairman , Copyrights Society of Nigeria, COSON, said he was dumbfounded as he needed to get a clearer picture of what happened to the legendary singer.\n\n\u201cVictor Uwaifo is not just a friend to me, he was a man I respected so much. I cannot say much now because I need to know what happened to him, \u201c Okoroji said.\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the family said the guitarist died after a brief illness.\n\nUwaifo was the first musician in Nigeria to be awarded the National Merit Honours of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON).\n\nHe was also the first Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism in Nigeria.\n\nBorn in Benin on March 1, 1941, Uwaifo was one of the foremost highlife musicians in Nigeria. He was trained sculptor, philosopher, poet and musical instrument inventor. His \u2018Joromi\u2019, hit song released in 1965, won for Nigeria the first Gold Disc Record ever to come out of the continent of Africa in a competitive world. Uwaifo is the first Benin man to receive the Nigerian National Honours; Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) in 1983, for his contributions to creativity and industry.\n\nHe was appointed and sworn-in as Justice of the Peace (JP) 1990. He is also the first and foremost Honourable Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism in Nigeria (Edo State), former lecturer in the Department of Fine and Applied Arts, University of Benin. He was honoured with an award in 2018 by the Association of Nigerian Musicologists for his outstanding music performance and leadership.\n\nHe was the Silverbird Man of the Year 2015 and honourary Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters, the highest literary academic body in Nigeria. Education: National Diploma (Graphics},Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, 1963, BA Hon (First Class), 1995, Masters degree (MFA) sculpture, 1997, Ph.D (Visual Arts), University of Benin, Nigeria. Project Title: Production of Architectural Sculpture in Nigeria: A Re-Invention of Ancient Benin Royal Altar Pieces into Contemporary Art Using Synthetic Polymer Materials\n\nUwaifo stands out today, intellectually sound both in mind and body as the most educated performing music icon in the world and the most read contemporary superstar still relevant over 50 years on stage till date. He has over 600 songs and 100 records to his credit with 8 gold and 2 silver awards. Each record is music of serious research and philosophical work equivalent to academic journal. He\u2019s a member of the Performing Rights Society of London (PRS), a trustee of Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN) and Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON). In 2016, Victor Uwaifo was inducted into the Grammy Award Museum in Los Angelis, USA. He has inspired generations of musicians in Nigeria and beyond and still counting.\n\nIn a WhatsApp chat with Vanguard during the celebration of his 80th birthday, Uwaifo described Joromi as the evergreen song which brought him international prominence.\n\nJoromi, composed in the singer\u2019s local dialect, was a five-minute track, and had for its solo, a mastery of skills on a variety of musical instruments including the electric guitar with an accompaniment of percussion and the electric piano.\n\nUwaifo also made use of vocals in making beats, which added more flavour to the song. The song, based on a folktale of the ancient Bini people tells the story of an undefeated warrior, named Joromi who had wrestled and defeated rivals until he was the ultimate warrior on earth. Without any more rivals, he decided to take the battle to the afterlife. Against the counsel of the elders, the fearsome Joromi engaged in battle with a warrior from the afterlife. This personal quest led to his end as he neither returned nor did the people of Bini till this day hear any news about him.\n\nHowever, 52 years after \u2018Joromi\u2019 ruled the airwaves, Uwaifo still regards the song as his greatest hit till date.\n\nLittle wonder, the living legend once sued singer Simi for N50 million for using the word \u2018Joromi\u2019 in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.

All hope was that the meeting of last week where all the affiliates of the Nigerian Medical Association except NARD signed the MOU would resolve the strike. We feel so concerned the strike hasn\u2019t been called off.\n\n\u201cStrike should be the last resort when every other effort has been exhausted in terms of finding a solution to whatever the problem is. But for any little thing, you resort to disruption of services; it does not portray the country in good light. It doesn\u2019t also portray the profession in good light, most especially such a profession that has to do with the preservation of human lives.\n\n\u201cIt makes them(doctors) insensitive and that is not right. For whatever reason, I think we should nip it in the bud. That is what we as a Forum of Chairmen of Health Institutions of Nigeria are in for. We need to find a solution to this. It is not good for us and it is not good for them. I bait that as you are solving this problem, others are warming up to start theirs. We can\u2019t allow them to continue. We must find a permanent solution.\n\n\u201cAs the representatives of their employers, we can\u2019t continue to fold our hands over this constant disruption of health services in the country. Our plan was to meet first with the NMA, NARD, and the Ministry of Health before coming to you. Incidentally, you are the first to open your doors to us. So, we came to intimate you with our plans. We will return when we round off meeting with them,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his response, Ngige said the government has adopted a holistic approach to tackling the challenges in the health sector, noting that some of the issues in contention cut across sectors.\n\nHe added that the government bent backward to improve the ease of the practice of medicine in the country despite dwindling resources.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe resident doctors are on the scheme of service against which obtained earlier.

It is part of the deficit budget funded by the World Bank and IMF.\n\n\u201cNow that the President has signed the law governing it, with signatures appended, we can access this fund through the CBN and from there to the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget Office and to the Accountant General of the Federation. But it is not what you achieve in a day.\n\n\u201cTake the issue of hazard allowance. It was even the Federal Government who noticed the paltry sum doctors and health workers receive and said No during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic last year. Considering the dangers they face, the government took the bull by the horn, approved, and released a jumbo, the sum of N32b as hazard allowance.\n\n\u201cWe felt this is commensurate with the dangers of the pandemic and immediately after, felt the need to re-negotiate and give them something more meaningful than the N5000 they were earning since 20 years and kept quiet.\n\n\u201cNow that we have invited for re-negotiation, they turned round to make it an issue, claiming that the process is too slow, meanwhile, they are the ones causing the delay. NMA and JOHESU can\u2019t agree on the table.\n\n\u201cRight now, the two have written me to say they won\u2019t negotiate together again.

          "text": "While enforcing some of its laws, the Kano Hisbah Board, often known as the Islamic police, has explained why it treats the rich and poor differently.\n\nA director of the Islamic police, Aliyu Kibiya gave the explanation when he featured on a Freedom Radio programme.\n\nAccording to Kibiya, it is against the tenets of Islam to publicly criticise a leader.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough we call on everybody in the society to do the right thing, we make the call on a case by case basis.\n\n\u201cIt is against the tenets of Islam to mount the podium and call out leaders. There are ways to caution a leader without criticising him in public.\u201d\n\nHisbah had recently come under intense pressure to act on some pictures of the daughter of the Emir of Bichi who recently got married to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s only son.\n\nA video of the wedding party shows Nigerian singer, Mayorkun singing and some of the party attendees spotting Afro, Mohawk, or any of the hairstyles Kano State Hisbah has labelled as \u201cunIslamic\u201d and an insult to Islam.\n\nAlso, secular songs Hisbah has vehemently frowned upon were played at the party, with young northern men and women dancing to them.\n\nAll these have attracted punishments from Kano Hisbah, in cases where poor Nigerians were involved.\n\nNoting the hypocrisy exhibited by the Islamic police, which were nowhere to be found during the wedding, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore had said, \u201cYusuf Buhari\u2019s wedding and the Kano Hisbah that shaves the head of poor people but was nowhere to be found around the highly secular Muhammadu Buhari son\u2019s wedding: One country, two laws -One is applicable to the poor and the other is applicable to rich and highly connected. Who says poverty is not a CRIME? #RevolutionNow #BuhariMustGo.\u201d\n\nIronically, Hisbah has been notorious for shaving the heads of poor northerners with Afro, Mohawk, and other hairstyles termed as \u201cunIslamic\u201d by the bias Islamic police.\n\nSimilarly, in February, a barber from Benue State, Elijah Ode, was arrested by Kano Hisbah in the Sabongari area of the state for giving his customers haircuts said to have offended the Islamic faith.\n\nTwo of Ode\u2019s customers were also tortured for having such \u201coffensive\u201d haircuts.\n\nThe religious police force reportedly arraigned Ode and had him remanded.\n\nRecently, after it was knocked by the public for being silent on the photographs of the bridal shower of Buhari\u2019s daughter-in-law, Hisbah responded by prohibiting the sharing of the bridal shower photographs.\n\nNEWS DIRECT had reported that some Nigerians highlighted Zahra\u2019s gown, part of which is made from a transparent material, while others pointed out that she did not have her hair covered as is usually done by Muslim women.\n\nThe Islamic police described sharing the photos online by Muslims as a sin.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic police have since banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, and playing of music at social events by disk jockeys.\n\nHisbah also banned commercial motorcycles and tricycle riders from carrying two women at a time.\n\nOf recent, the Kano State Hisbah Board banned the use of mannequins to display clothes by tailors, supermarkets, and boutique owners in the state.\n\nHisbah Commander-in-Chief, Ustaz Harun Muhammad Sani Ibn Sina, had said the use of mannequins by tailors, boutique owners, and others contravenes the provision of Islamic injunctions.\n\nHe added that the agency would educate offenders on how Islam frowns on the use of mannequins and send its officials to apprehend and prosecute them.",

When it was formed, Mr Ortom was a member of the APC until in 2018 when he dumped the party to join the PDP.\n\nHowever, contrary to Mr Shehu\u2019s claim that Mr Buhari \u201csaved the country\u2019s democracy\u201d, instead the regime has been notorious for gross human rights abuses, extra judicial killing of protesters and massive clamp down on the media, considered by many as the worst in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nMr Buhari in disobedience to court orders detained former National Security adviser, Dasuki Sambo; Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore; separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu, and leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, for several months in spite of court orders granting them bail.\n\nNigerians have also witnessed cases of killing of protesters across the country as the police and army continue to open live rounds on protesting citizens since Mr Buhari assumed office in 2015.\n\nIn 2015, shortly after Mr Buhari came into power, over 348 members of Shiites Islamic group were massacred and buried in a mass grave by the Nigerian military.\n\nAmnesty International had in 2016 reported how the Nigerian military extra judicially killed at least 150 peaceful pro-Biafra protesters in the South-East part of the country.\n\nA nationwide protest against years of police brutality and extra judicial killings, christened #EndSARS, ended on a tragic note when on the night of October 20, 2020, the military opened live rounds on young Nigerians gathered at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos.",

Likewise, we can use technology to bring new things to our party. We can use technology to easily reach young people who are digitally native.\n\n\u201d We can use technology to improve our voter\u2019s membership registration processes. And we can use it to reach out to young people. So, this is a great task. We want to assure the national chairman and the secretary that we will do all that is possible to make sure we transform our party to become a digitally native party.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not a simple task.

          "text": "Live Afghanistan Live Updates: As Pullout Deadline Looms, U.S. Warns of a New Threat The embassy said there was a \u201cspecific, credible\u201d danger to the Kabul airport. Britain has withdrawn the last of its troops. Some banks in the capital have reopened.\n\nThe U.S. reports a \u2018credible\u2019 new threat at the airport as evacuations wind down. Taliban fighters at Kabul\u2019s international airport on Saturday. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times U.S. officials warned Americans in Afghanistan on Sunday to leave the Kabul airport area immediately because of a security threat, hours after President Biden said that another terrorist attack there was \u201chighly likely.\u201d The United States Embassy in the Afghan capital said there was a \u201cspecific, credible threat\u201d to the airport area, where a suicide bombing on Thursday killed as many as 170 civilians and 13 members of the American military. State Department officials have issued several similar warnings in recent days. With just two days left before Mr. Biden\u2019s Tuesday deadline to complete the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the latest warning added to a heightened sense of foreboding. It came as the military was shifting its focus from vetting and airlifting Afghan and American civilians to bringing its own personnel home. On Sunday morning, American University of Afghanistan students and their families boarded buses bound for the airport, on what could prove to be the last day of civilian evacuations. The American troop departures will mark the tumultuous end to a 20-year war that has left the country awash in grief and desperation, with many Afghans fearing for their lives under Taliban rule and struggling to support their families amid cash shortages and rising food prices. At least some banks had opened in Kabul on Sunday, and long lines had formed outside their doors. Image A bank in Kabul\u2019s Shahr-e Naw neighborhood on Sunday. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times In his statement on Saturday, Mr. Biden said another attack at the airport was \u201chighly likely\u201d in the next 24 to 36 hours. He said he had directed the U.S. military to \u201cprotect our men and women on the ground.\u201d Fearing another attack, the Taliban pushed people away from the airport on Sunday, stringing barbed wire across the road to disperse crowds, according to Al Jazeera. Mr. Biden also promised that the U.S. military\u2019s retaliatory strike Friday against the Islamic State\u2019s Afghan affiliate, which has claimed responsibility for the Thursday bombing, would not be the last. The drone strike, in Nangarhar Province near the Pakistan border, killed two members of the group, the Pentagon said. Britain has withdrawn the last of its troops from Afghanistan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a video posted Sunday on Twitter. He praised them for working around the clock under \u201charrowing conditions\u201d to airlift more than 15,000 people, including Britons and Afghans, to safety in less than two weeks. He said all remaining British diplomats and civil servants had left the country. The attack at the airport on Thursday, which happened as U.S. troops were screening people hoping to enter, once again underscored the human toll of the war \u2014 both for Afghans, the overwhelming majority of the victims, and for the American families who lost loved ones sent to fight it. The 13 American military personnel who were killed came from across the country, from California to Wyoming to Tennessee, and had an average age of just over 22. Eleven were Marines, one was a Navy medic and another was in the Army. They included Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo, 25, of Lawrence, Mass. Her former junior R.O.T.C. instructor recalled her as an \u201cabsolute warrior\u201d in high school, and Marine First Lt. John Coppola said in a statement that she had been \u201ccrucial to evacuating thousands of women and children.\u201d Also killed was Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, 23, of Sacramento, Calif. In a post on Instagram, in which she is seen holding a child in Kabul, she wrote, \u201cI love my job.\u201d About 113,500 people, most of them Afghans, have been evacuated since Aug. 14, a Pentagon official said, the day before the Taliban seized Kabul. On Saturday, about 1,400 people were still at the airport, having been screened and booked for flights, Pentagon officials said. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans are still thought to be trying to flee the country. Mr. Biden and other global leaders have acknowledged that many will not get out before the deadline.

Pool photo by Jonathan Brady Britain announced on Sunday that the last of its soldiers and staff, including the country\u2019s ambassador to Afghanistan, had boarded evacuation flights out of Kabul, essentially ending its two-decade military involvement in the war. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, praising their efforts in a national address posted to Twitter, said that the troops and officials had worked around the clock \u201cto a remorseless deadline in harrowing conditions\u201d to airlift more than 15,000 people, including Britons and Afghans, to safety in less than two weeks. The ambassador, Laurie Bristow, who had stayed in Kabul, the Afghan capital, to help with the evacuation process, confirmed in a video on Sunday morning that he had landed at a military air base in Oxfordshire, northwest of London. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to leave Afghanistan for now, and the embassy will operate from Qatar for the time being,\u201d he said, adding that London would put pressure on the Taliban to allow the transport to Britain of other Afghans and Britons left behind. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to protect the gains of the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Bristow added. It was not immediately clear how many British citizens and Afghans with permission to travel to Britain were still in Afghanistan. Ultimately, 150,000 British service members did a tour of duty in Afghanistan, 457 troops died, and thousands more were wounded, Mr. Johnson said. Two Britons and the child of a Briton were among those killed in a suicide bombing outside the gates of the international airport in Kabul on Thursday. Critics have denounced the sudden withdrawal from the country, but Mr. Johnson said that Britain had followed the lead of the United States and that the efforts over the past two decades had saved lives. \u201cIn the last 20 years, not a single terrorist attack has been launched from Afghan soil against the U.K. or any other Western country,\u201d he said in a letter addressed to members of the armed forces, adding that troops had \u201ckept Al Qaeda from our door for two decades.\u201d Britain would remain a presence in the region, Mr. Johnson said, adding that humanitarian assistance would double to 286 million pounds, or about $393 million. \u201cWe will use every lever we have \u2014 political, economic, diplomatic \u2014 to help the people of Afghanistan and to protect our country from harm,\u201d he said.

Taliban fighters in Kabul on Aug. 15, the day the militants took control of the city. Credit... Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times As American troops rush to complete their withdrawal by President Biden\u2019s Tuesday deadline, many Afghans are afraid that reprisals from the country\u2019s new rulers will soon follow. When Taliban fighters seized control of Kabul two weeks ago, the invading units made a beeline for two critical targets: the headquarters of the National Security Directorate and the Ministry of Communications. Their aim \u2014 recounted by two Afghan officials who had been briefed separately on the raid \u2014 was to secure the files of intelligence officers and their informers, and to obtain the means of tracking the telephone numbers of Afghan citizens. That could be disastrous for hundreds of thousands of people who had been working to counter the Taliban threat. So far, the Taliban\u2019s political leadership has presented a moderate face, promising amnesty to government security forces who lay down their arms. They have even written letters of guarantee that they will not be pursued, although reserving the right to prosecute serious crimes. Spokesmen for the Taliban have also talked of forming an inclusive government. A Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said in a Twitter post in English that there was no settling of scores. Nor, he said, was there a hit list with which the Taliban were conducting door-to-door searches, as has been rumored. \u201cGeneral amnesty has been granted,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cwe are focusing on future.\u201d Yet there are growing reports of detentions, disappearances and even executions at the hands of the Taliban, in what some current and former government officials describe as a covert pursuit of the militants\u2019 enemies. The scale of the campaign is uncertain because it is being conducted covertly. And it is unclear what level of the Taliban leadership authorized detentions or executions. \u201cIt\u2019s very much underground,\u201d said one former legislator, who was in hiding elsewhere when the Taliban visited his home in the middle of the night.\n\n\u2018Heartbreaking and terrifying.\u2019 Two nonprofit groups are making a last-minute attempt to help Afghan women escape.

Wakil Kohsar/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Two nonprofit organizations that have been trying, with disappointing results, to help scores of prominent Afghan women and their families escape their country have been finding increasingly formidable obstacles in their paths. Sanam Naraghi Anderlini, the founder and chief executive of the Washington, D.C.,-based International Civil Society Action Network, said the group has been trying to find room on charter flights for the Afghans, who include journalists, human rights activists and others. But the suicide bombing at the Kabul airport on Thursday has made those efforts much more difficult. \u201cIn the last day or two, I am getting a lot of women telling me goodbye. Women starting to give up,\u201d said Deeyah Khan, an International Civil Society Action Network board member and a documentary filmmaker. \u201cThe least we can do is make sure they don\u2019t stand completely alone.\u201d Too Young to Wed, a nonprofit based in Peekskill, N.Y., that was founded by the photojournalist Stephanie Sinclair, has also been trying to organize charter flights to evacuate prominent Afghan women since the Taliban took over Afghanistan. As of Saturday, Ms. Sinclair said the group had only been able to help about 60 women and their families leave the country on flights and is now considering trying to organize evacuations by land that would involve a long, dangerous journey to border areas. \u201cIt is heartbreaking and terrifying that this generation of women leaders have to fear their lives, for simply having dreams and wanting to have a purpose in life as a woman,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said. The two organizations have received calls and messages from Afghan women who are unsure what to do and how to keep their family members safe. The Taliban\u2019s chief spokesman has said that \u201cthere will be no violence against women\u201d under the new regime. Zabihullah Mujahid promised this week that \u201cno prejudice against women will be allowed\u201d and said that they could participate in society \u2014 \u201cwithin the bounds of Islamic law.\u201d But in social media posts and interviews, many Afghan women say the Taliban have already imposed some restrictions. Some women who were employees of the former government have stopped going to work, fearing retribution. \u201cI am waiting for some kind of miracle to take me out of this country,\u201d said Hossy, 24, a college student in Kabul who wanted to create an engineering company led by women engineers. \u201cMy future under the Taliban is a dead end.\u201d Lauren McCarthy and\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTurkey, Qatar and G7 to discuss the future of Kabul airport.

Jim Huylebroek for The New York Times Officials from Turkey, Qatar and the Group of 7 nations planned to meet on Monday to discuss the future of Afghanistan, including the Kabul airport, according to two officials familiar with the discussions. After the American military leaves on Tuesday, the path for Afghan evacuees will only grow more difficult as the Taliban takes full control of the airport. France and Britain will submit a U. N. resolution proposing a safe zone in Kabul to protect people trying to leave Afghanistan, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday, according to a Reuters report. Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, said on Friday that officials were in talks with allies and the Taliban to allow nonmilitary flights to resume as quickly as possible after the U.S. military\u2019s departure. He would not comment on reports that Turkey and Qatar were planning to run the airport with the Taliban. Reuters reported on Friday that Turkey was hesitant to commit to controlling the airport with the Taliban because of security risks. Mr. Price noted that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had spoken with Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, on Saturday about Afghanistan, but a brief description of the call made no mention of the airport. By contrast, a summary of a call on Friday between Mr. Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, touched on the collapse of Afghanistan and \u201cthe importance of maintaining operations at Hamid Karzai International Airport after the withdrawal of coalition forces to enable humanitarian aid and essential travel.\u201d",

But the first commanders have often been replaced by more heavy-handed enforcers who conduct raids and abductions, officials of the former government said.\n\nThe scale of the campaign is unclear, since it is being conducted covertly. Nor is it clear what level of the Taliban leadership authorized detentions or executions.\n\nThe people who seized the files at the National Security Directorate and the Ministry of Communications may not have even been Taliban: The men did not speak Afghan languages, the officials said, and may have been agents of Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency working in tandem with Taliban forces.

          "title": "Nigeria at $432bn Still Africa\u2019s Biggest Economy Despite South Africa\u2019s Rebased GDP of $370bn",
          "text": "Nigeria has maintained her position as Africa\u2019s biggest economy after South Africa released the report of its rebased Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that pushed the latter\u2019s economy up by 11 per cent, an analysis of a new report by Statistics South Africa (SSA), has revealed.\n\nAfter a comprehensive overhaul of its national accounts up to the end of the 2020 fiscal year, South Africa disclosed in the SSA that the value of her economy increased to $370 billion as a result of the rebasing exercise.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nDuring the period under review, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the World Bank put Nigeria\u2019s GDP at $432.29 billion, indicating that her economy was $62.29 billion bigger than South Africa\u2019s after the latter rebased its GDP.\n\nIn a summary report obtained from its official website at the weekend, South Africa\u2019s statistics agency said the latest GDP rebasing and benchmarking exercise had resulted in an upward revision in the size of the economy, as well as changes to the composition of the supply and demand sides of economic activity.\n\nSpecifically, SSA\u2019s rebasing report showed that the rebased GDP \u201cis 11 per cent larger in 2020 than previously estimated. Between 2011 and 2020, the percentage difference between the previous and revised levels averaged 9.6 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe percentage difference ranged between 8.6 per cent in 2014 to 11 per cent in 2020. The time series was revised from 1993. Differences between previous and revised levels are a typical outcome of rebasing and benchmarking exercises,\u201d SSA revealed in its latest report released midweek.\n\nComparatively, the report said the average increase between previous and revised GDP estimates across OECD countries was 3.8 per cent in 2010, ranging from 0.2 per cent for Luxembourg to 7.8 per cent for South Korea.\n\nIt added: \u201cLatin America recorded an average increase of 8.8 per cent and closer to home; Botswana revised the size of its economy down by 10 percent. How does South Africa\u2019s revised GDP affect its standing in Africa?\n\n\u201cIn terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), the World Bank currently ranks South Africa as the third biggest economy on the continent after Egypt and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEgypt\u2019s GDP (PPP$ in current prices) was PPP$1,290 billion, according to the World Bank\u2019s estimate, higher than that of Nigeria (PPP$1,069 billion) and South Africa (PPP$717 billion),\u201d the report said.\n\nDespite the 11 per cent increase recorded after rebasing, Africa\u2019s most advanced economy still lags behind Nigeria, which is at N154.25 trillion or $432.29 billion in 2020 as shown in the data of the NBS and World Bank.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe latest growth, according to the NBS in its new report, makes three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\nIn the report, the NBS said: \u201cThe Q2, 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10 percent growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51 per cent recorded in Q1, 2021 year on year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen before the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70 per cent in 2021 compared to -2.18 per cent for the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, quarter on quarter, real GDP grew at -0.79 percent in Q2, 2021 compared to Q1, 2021, reflecting slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\n\u201cThe nominal GDP growth rate in Q2, 2021 was higher than -2.80 per cent growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic. The Q2, 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than the 12.25 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2021. For better clarity, the Nigerian economy has been classified broadly into the oil and non-oil sectors.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development yesterday, the immediate past Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf told THISDAY that the size of an economy \u201cmatters a lot.\u201d\n\nYusuf, an economist, and a leading private sector advocate, pointed out that the size of an economy \u201cindicates the inherent opportunities for investment, revenue, profit, job creation and the welfare of the people.\u201d\n\nHowever, the economist observed that the size of the economy \u201cis not an end in itself. Rather, it should be a means to an end. The quality of lives must be positively impacted.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, pointed out that economic inclusion \u201cis critical in ensuring an impactful economy. Nigeria and South Africa are the two biggest economies in Africa. Yet, the two economies are grappling with profound challenges around inequality, poverty, social discontent, and insecurity.\n\n\u201cAll of these are manifestations of the absence of inclusion and social dislocations. Only recently, the two countries witnessed looting and destruction on an unprecedented scale.\n\n\u201cAlthough the triggers were different, the events were reflections of the underlying social problems that existed in these two countries. The standard of living in many countries in Africa is far higher than what we have in the two leading economies of the continent.\u201d\n\nYusuf, therefore, challenged the governments of Nigeria and South Africa to design economic and social policies to fix these gaps, which according to him, would require a greater focus on investment in social infrastructures such as education, healthcare, and the environment.\n\nHe explained that high investment in social infrastructure \u201cimpacts significantly on people\u2019s welfare. Investment in economic infrastructure \u2013 roads, railways, or power \u2013 is critical as well. This would impact productivity, cost of production, inflation, and the general level of competitiveness of firms.\n\n\u201cThe macroeconomic management is also crucial to ensure that the economic fundamentals support investment and productivity. This should support low inflation, stable currency, and low-interest rates. The growth of small businesses is vital to the promotion of economic inclusion because of their number and spread across the country.\n\n\u201cAn investment-friendly policy, regulatory and institutional environment is imperative. Hostile regulatory and institutional environments undermine investors\u2019 confidence and impact negatively on the economy,\u201d Yusuf explained.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",

          "text": "The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has issued a 21-day strike notice to the federal government with effect from today (Monday).\n\nThis is coming as the federal government said it has set aside the sum of N4.8 billion as a residency training fund for the striking doctors in the country.\n\nAt the end of her National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Benin City, Edo State held from the August 22 to 28, the association and all the affiliates resolved to give the federal government 21-day notice to fully resolve all the issues contained in the various agreements signed with the doctors.\n\nIn a statement signed by the NMA President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, and Secretary General, D.r Philips Uche Ekpe, the association said: \u201cAfter due consideration NEC has put the federal government on a 21-day notice to fully resolve all the issues contained in the various agreements signed with Affiliate members of the Nigerian Medical Association, including MDCAN, MEDSABAMS and NARD.\u201d\n\nThe statement said further said that NMA fully supports all her affiliates in their efforts to improve the healthcare delivery in Nigeria and the Welfare of her members.\n\n\u201cNEC affirms that no doctor shall be victimised for participating/not participating in the strike action by NARD.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the federal government fails to implement the agreements after the expiration of the 21- day notice, NMA shall summon an emergency delegate meeting to review the progress made on the implementation of the agreements.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government said it has set aside the sum of N4.8 billion as a residency training fund for the striking resident doctors in the country.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who disclosed this at the weekend during a meeting with the Chairman of the Forum Chairmen of Health Institutions in Nigeria (FCHIN), Dr. Sam Sam Jaja, said that the leadership of the NARD gave the government an impossible condition before they would agree to sign the MOU reached at the last conciliatory meeting.\n\nHe said the resident doctors wanted the government to exempt them from the application of Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act that provides for \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 sanctions for striking workers.\n\nWhile giving an update on the efforts being made to meet the demands of the doctors, Ngige said that the implementation of the MOA signed on August 21 with the doctors was on course.\n\nHe said the government has adopted a holistic approach to tackling the challenges in the health sector, noting that some of the issues in contention cut across sectors.\n\nHe added that the government bent backward to improve the ease of the practice of medicine in the country despite dwindling resources.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctors are on the scheme of service against which obtained earlier. There was nothing like that. Nigeria is also about the only country that has the Medical Residency Training Fund, backed up by an Act, Medical Residency Training Act, passed into law by this administration in 2018. N4.8 billion is already in 2021 Service Wide Vote for this \u2013 to cover exam fees, books, travel to exam centres, and accommodation. We are battling to meet up the timeline on this,\u201d the minister added.\n\nExplaining further, Ngige said: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the Residency Training Fund for 2021 is a borrowed fund. It is part of the deficit budget funded by the World Bank and IMF.\n\n\u201cNow, that the President has signed the law governing it, with signatures appended, we can access this fund through the CBN and from there to the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget Office, and to the Accountant General of the Federation. But it is not what you achieve in a day. It takes some time but these young doctors will hear none of that.\u201d\n\nRegarding the controversy over the non-signing of Memorandum of Understanding by the resident doctors, Ngige said all the issues contained in the MoU, ranging from arrears of the consequential adjustment of the National Minimum Wage, Skipping Allowance, Bench fees among others were successfully tackled at the meeting of August 20 and 21.\n\nHe also said that all affiliates of the NMA signed the MOA, with only NARD dissenting.\n\n\u201cNARD wants a particular clause to be inserted in the agreement. That Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act should not apply to them. That we should insert in a government agreement that they should be paid for the period they are not at work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being careful about this. This is the law and I will not lend myself to illegality, to state in the agreement that a group of Nigerians is above the law.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) expended N541.65 billion subsidy on petrol between February and July this year, a document detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for August 2021, has shown.\n\nThe document obtained by THISDAY showed that N25.374 billion was spent on what the corporation terms under-recovery or value shortfall in February, it was N60.39 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April.\n\nIt more than doubled to N126.298 billion in May, markedly reduced to N164.337 billion in June, and further came down to N103.286 billion in July.\n\nAs a consequence of the payment, the NNPC has been largely unable to fully remit its \u2018calendared projected monthly contribution of N209 billion to the joint account since February, with the worst case being in April when it remitted zero amount to FAAC.\n\nOn Friday, THISDAY reported that the corporation was again set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint federation account, being a combination of N175 billion subsidy sum and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, an improvement on the N47.162 billion in June, with the succeeding month\u2019s payment being about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, the net revenue to FAAC by the NNPC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June, and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nYear-to-date, the document showed that the NNPC had only been able to make a contribution of N349.254 billion to the three tiers of government with a huge deficit of N1.115 trillion.\n\nIn all, in July, as released on August, 16 local and international oil trading companies had dealings with the NNPC under the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase arrangement in 28 transactions in the month.\n\nNNPC\u2019s profit was N67.2 billion, with contributions from JV crude being N1.632 billion, domiciled crude being N31.73 billion, while miscellaneous income and domiciled gas were N27.11 billion and N6.795 billion respectively.\n\nIn terms of federal government priority projects, national domestic gas development gulped N2.52 billion during the month, gas infrastructure development cost N2.977 billion, and the Brass LNG gas supply project did not get any funding.\n\nIn addition, frontier exploration services gulped N2.975 billion, renewables consumed N885 million, total spending on pipeline security and maintenance was N7.352 billion, and refinery rehabilitation, the main payment for salaries and utilities, was N8.33 billion. Furthermore, N83 million was spent on the Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nOf all the cost centres during the month, only under-recovery and pipelines security were fully funded, leaving other projects like domestic gas financing, for instance, under-funded to the tune of N24.3 billion, gas infrastructure with a deficit of N17.853 billion, and frontier exploration by N14.652 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, N1.304 trillion has been deducted for recurrent and capital expenditures by the NNPC, according to the document, while total distribution plus miscellaneous hit N1.653 trillion in July. However, a deficit of N1.250 trillion remained hanging.\n\nVandalism of NNPC infrastructure continued as a breakdown of the pipeline and management cost of N3.659 billion indicated that N2.708 billion was for security maintenance, pipelines, and facilities repairs were N392.950 million, while the NNPC\u2019s strategic holding was N577.410 million.\n\nThe status of the NNPC\u2019s payment to its Joint Venture cash call arrears obligation has remained unchanged since May at $3.22 billion out of a total negotiated sum of $4.689 billion since 2016. The outstanding balance remained $1.464 billion since May this year.\n\nBut added to JV cost recovery and priority projects, the document revealed that the total distribution, made by the corporation in January was N195.624 billion, it was N191.194 billion in February and hit N224.589 billion in March.\n\nIn addition, it was to N156.366 in April, but again hit a high of N320.315 in May and was N295.396 and N270.405 billion in June and July respectively.\n\nIn June the corporation had continued its regime of deductions from the federation account withholding N117.4 billion from the three tiers of government.\n\nTwo months ago, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres and worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nThe national oil company stated that the under-recovery or subsidy that the government pays on the product every month had begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThis, it said was making the corporation unable to contribute fully to the national coffers, the federation account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the gains made from rising international oil prices.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, had also explained that with the exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre in June, maintaining that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nA THISDAY check-in July showed that the NNPC\u2019s payment to the federation account had declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) expended N541.65 billion subsidy on petrol between February and July this year, a document detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for August 2021, has shown.\nOn Friday, THISDAY reported that the corporation was again set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint federation account, being a combination of N175 billion subsidy sum and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\nThe data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, an improvement on the N47.162 billion in June, with the succeeding month\u2019s payment being about N20 billion higher than that of June.\nTwo months ago, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres and worsening the subsidy payment regime.\nA THISDAY check-in July showed that the NNPC\u2019s payment to the federation account had declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021.",

          "title": "Powerful Hurricane Ida Closing in on Louisiana Landfall",
          "text": "Hurricane Ida strengthened into a major hurricane early Sunday, which could potentially bring devastating damage to Louisiana and the Gulf Coast.\n\nIda had maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph), making it a Category 3 hurricane, according to a 2 a.m. advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nIda was centered 105 miles (170 kilometers) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and 185 miles (295 kilometers) southeast of Houma, Louisiana. It was traveling northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).\n\nForecasters said Ida could intensify to a Category 4 hurricane with top winds around 130 mph (209 kph) before landfall. It was expected to make landfall Sunday afternoon. The storm was expected to bring dangerous storm surge, heavy rain and strong winds.\n\nHurricane Ida crossed the Gulf of Mexico on track for a potentially devastating landfall on the Louisiana coast Sunday, while emergency officials in the region grappled with opening shelters for displaced evacuees despite the risks of spreading the coronavirus.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center predicted Ida could be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with 130 mph (209 kph) winds when it makes an expected afternoon landfall. The storm arrived on the exact date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier.\n\nIda was a Category 2 hurricane Saturday night with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph). The storm was centered about 235 miles (375 kilometers) southeast of coastal Houma, Louisiana, and was traveling northwest at 16 mph (26 kph).\n\nThe storm threatened a region already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, thanks to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.\n\nNew Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards vowed Saturday that Louisiana\u2019s \u201cresilient and tough people\u201d would weather the storm. He also noted shelters would operate with reduced capacities \u201cto reflect the realities of COVID.\u201d\n\nEdwards said Louisiana officials were already working to find hotel rooms for many evacuees so that fewer had to stay in mass shelters. He noted that during last year\u2019s hurricane season, Louisiana found rooms for 20,000 people.\n\n\u201cSo, we know how to do this,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI hope and pray we don\u2019t have to do it anywhere near that extent.\u201d\n\nIn coastal Gulfport, Mississippi, a Red Cross shelter posted signs displaying directions for evacuees along with warnings about COVID-19. With skies still sunny, only a handful of people had shown up Saturday evening.\n\nShelter manager Barbara Casterlin said workers were required to wear face masks. Evacuees were encouraged to do the same. Anyone who refuses will be sent to an isolated area, she said, and so will people who are sick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not checking vaccinations,\u201d Casterlin said, \u201cbut we are doing temperature checks two or three times a day.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida\u2019s arrival.\n\nComparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. A Category 3 storm, Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it demolished oceanfront homes in Mississippi and caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans.\n\nIn Saucier, Mississippi, Alex and Angela Bennett spent Saturday afternoon filling sand bags to place around their flood-prone home. Both survived Katrina, and didn\u2019t expect Ida to cause nearly as much destruction where they live, based on forecasts.\n\n\u201cKatrina was terrible. This ain\u2019t gonna be nothing,\u201d Alex Bennett said. \u201cI hate it for Louisiana, but I\u2019m happy for us.\u201d\n\nLong lines formed at gas pumps Saturday as people rushed to escape. Trucks pulling saltwater fishing boats and campers streamed away from the coast on Interstate 65 in Alabama, while traffic jams clogged Interstate 10 heading out of New Orleans.\n\nIda intensified so swiftly that New Orleans officials said there was no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of its 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to leave voluntarily. Those who stayed were warned to prepare for long power outages amid sweltering heat.\n\nOfficials also stressed that the levee and drainage systems protecting the city had been much improved since Katrina. But they cautioned flooding was still possible with up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain forecast in some areas.\n\nEdwards said 5,000 National Guard troops were being staged in 14 Louisiana parishes for search and rescue efforts. And 10,000 linemen were on standby to respond to electrical outages.\n\nIda posed a threat far beyond New Orleans. A hurricane warning was issued for nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) of Louisiana\u2019s coastline, from Intracoastal City south of Lafayette to the Mississippi state line. A tropical storm warning was extended to the Alabama-Florida line.\n\nMeteorologist Jeff Masters, who flew hurricane missions for the government and founded Weather Underground, said Ida is forecast to move through \u201cthe just absolute worst place for a hurricane.\u201d\n\nThe Interstate 10 corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is a critical hub of the nation\u2019s petrochemical industry, lined with oil refineries, natural gas terminals and chemical manufacturing plants. Entergy, Louisiana\u2019s major electricity provider, operates two nuclear power plants along the Mississippi River.\n\nA U.S. Energy Department map of oil and gas infrastructure shows scores of low-lying sites in the storm\u2019s projected path that are listed as potentially vulnerable to flooding.",

          "title": "Kabul Airlift in Final Phase as US Warns of More attack; Taliban Ready to Take Over Airport",
          "text": "U.S. forces are in the final phase of leaving Kabul, ending two decades of involvement in Afghanistan, and just over 1,000 civilians at the airport remain to be flown out before troops withdraw, a Western security official said on Sunday.\n\nThe country\u2019s new Taliban rulers are prepared to take control of the airport, said an official from the hardline Islamist movement that has swept cross Afghanistan, crushing the U.S.-backed government.\n\nThe Western security official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters a date and time for the end of the operation was yet to be decided.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he will stick by his deadline to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by Tuesday, 20 years after they invaded Kabul and ousted the Taliban government for shielding the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that every foreign civilian and those who are at risk are evacuated today. Forces will start flying out once this process is over,\u201d said the official, who is stationed at the airport.\n\nThe Western-backed government and Afghan army melted away as the Taliban entered the capital on Aug. 15, leaving an administrative vacuum that has bolstered fears of a financial collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nUnder a deal with the United States, the Taliban has said it will allow foreigners and Afghans who wish to leave to fly out. The United States and allies have taken about 113,500 people out of Afghanistan in the past two weeks, but tens of thousands who want to go will be left behind.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Saturday there were fewer than 4,000 troops left at the airport, down from 5,800 at the peak of the evacuation mission. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters some troops had been withdrawn but declined to say how many remained.\n\nThe Taliban official told Reuters the Islamist group had engineers and technicians ready to take charge of the airport.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the final nod from the Americans to secure full control over Kabul airport as both sides aim for a swift handover,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Western security official said crowds at the airport gates had diminished after a specific warning from the U.S. government of another attack by militants after a suicide bombing outside the airport on Thursday.\n\nThe explosion killed scores of Afghans and 13 American troops outside the gates of the airport, where thousands of Afghans had gathered to try to get a flight out since the Taliban returned to power.\n\nThe United States said on Friday it killed two militants belonging to Islamic State \u2013 enemies of both the West and Afghanistan\u2019s new Taliban rulers \u2013 which had claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nBiden had vowed to hunt down the perpetrators of the explosion and said the strike was not the last.\n\nThe Taliban condemned the late-night U.S. drone strike, which took place in Nangarhar province, an eastern area that borders Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThe Americans should have informed us before conducting the air strike. It was a clear attack on Afghan territory,\u201d a Taliban spokesman told Reuters, adding that two women and a child were wounded in the attack.\n\nThe Taliban have said they have arrested some suspects involved in the airport blast.\n\nSpokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Saturday the Taliban would take over the airport \u201cvery soon\u201d after U.S. forces withdraw and announce a full cabinet in the coming days.\n\nMujahid told Reuters the group had appointed governors and police chiefs in all but one of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces and would act to solve the country\u2019s economic problems.\n\nThe Taliban, facing the loss of billions of dollars of aid for the country, appealed to the United States and other Western nations to maintain diplomatic relations after withdrawing. Britain said that should happen only if the Taliban allow safe passage for those who want to leave and respect human rights.\n\nU.S. military and allied countries\u2019 flights carried fewer people on Saturday as Washington prepared to end its mission.\n\nThe last British flight evacuating civilians from Afghanistan left Kabul on Saturday. British troops would take small numbers of Afghan citizens with them as they leave this weekend, a defence ministry spokesperson said. Armed forces chief Nick Carter said hundreds of people who had worked with Britain would not make it through.\n\nWhile Kabul\u2019s airport has been in chaos, the rest of the city has been generally calm. The Taliban have told residents to hand over government equipment including weapons and vehicles within a week, the group\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nThe airport attack added fuel to criticism Biden faced at home and abroad for the chaos after Afghanistan\u2019s government and military collapsed before a lightning Taliban advance. He has defended his decisions, saying the United States long ago achieved its rationale for invading in 2001",
