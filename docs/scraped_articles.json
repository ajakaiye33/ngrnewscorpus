In Nigeria, with 14.4%, the drug use prevalence is significantly higher than the global average,\u201d it said.\n\nThe UN body pointed out that globally, over 11 million people were estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C, while opioids continued to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use.\n\nA clear indicator of the frightful increase in drug use is the increase in daily doses of pharmaceutical opioids used to treat opioids disorder, which grew from 557 million daily doses to 3.31 billion daily doses in 2019.\n\nIt further pointed out that drug markets on the dark web, which only emerged a decade ago, now have some of its top companies grossing at least $315 million in annual sales.\n\n\u201cAlthough this is just a fraction of overall drug sales, the trend is upwards with a fourfold increase between 2011 to mid-2017 and mid-2017 to 2020.\n\n\u201cRapid technological innovation, combined with the agility and adaptability of those using new platforms to sell drugs and other substances, is likely to usher in a globalized market where all drugs are more available and accessible everywhere,\u201d UNODC said.\n\nOn the milestones recorded amid COVID-19, the report said that the pandemic triggered innovation and adaptation in drug prevention and treatment services through more flexible models of service delivery.\n\nIt noted that many countries introduced or expanded telemedicine services due to the pandemic, with Nigeria training 130 health care professionals to respond to drug use issues.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Moses Nosike\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment has expressed support for the 2020 Corporate Sustainable Investor Report (CSIR), a research document that analyses the sustainability progress of companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CSIR is a multi-stakeholder developed report led by CSR-in-Action, a foremost African sustainability consulting and advocacy firm. It takes into primary cognisance, the local business milieu in Nigeria and Africa at large.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSOOsinbajo maintains stand, Nigeria, others, plan stopping moves to defund gas project\n\nThe first of its kind in the country, the information in the CSIR has been methodically grouped under seven key performance indices, namely: Human Rights and Decent Labour, Innovation, Ethical Economics, Stakeholder Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability and Sustainability Management.\n\nWith sustainability emerging as a core component of business strategy for efficient and dynamic corporate organisations, socio-economic and governance frameworks like the CSIR have become vital tools for driving sustainable development.\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi said, \u201cI strongly believe that sound public policy on trade and investment in Nigeria will provide the foundation for the establishment of key economic and industrial projects that will lead to substantive transformation.\n\nI deeply appreciate the development of this Corporate Sustainable Investment Report which encourages sustainable and ethical business practices. I am certain that it will contribute significantly to enhancing the investment ecosystem and encouraging businesses to adopt the right practices that will empower Nigerians\u201d.\n\nSince the launch of the first edition in 2012 at the 17th Nigerian Economic Summit (NESG) with former Director General, NESG, Frank Nweke Jr and Chairman of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu OON, the Corporate Sustainable Investor Report has become a one-stop resource for all sustainability and business practitioners interested in Nigeria to assess the values and ethical economics priorities of major Nigerian businesses, view emerging trends within industries that reflect their specific sustainability concerns, get an overview of Nigerian business\u2019s current position in the journey of sustainability and inculcate the culture of transparency through reporting.\n\nIn the wake of major human rights abuses in recent decades, there has been an increased interest in acknowledging human rights. Oftentimes, established companies are unwittingly complicit in this repression of human rights.\n\nThat is why one of the six core assessment criteria of the CSIR is human rights.\n\n\u201cNow on its 4th edition, the CSIR continues to get bigger and better every year, addressing hitherto obscure discourses such as human rights. Besides being a tool of reference for government, regulators and investors concerned with sustainable business practices in Nigeria, the CSIR also provides a viable and equitable platform for corporate organisations in Nigeria to project themselves as sustainable corporate brands,\u201d said Bekeme Masade-Olowola, Chief Executive of CSR-in-Action.\n\nAccording to Masade-Olowola, the 2020 CSIR has been independently developed using a diverse team of stakeholders, tailored to suit the local milieu and its challenges, is totally unbiased and has deftly structured ranking criteria.\n\nTo be included in the CSIR, corporate organisations need to meet two out of the four prerequisites. These include the possession of a standard, annual and publicly available CSR/ sustainability report, listing on the Nigerian Stocks Exchange (NSE), annual revenue of N500 million, and business existence for four years.",

This training supports the company\u2019s vision to ensure that none of its packaging, including plastics, ends up in landfill or as littler, including in oceans, lakes or rivers and her commitment to protect the planet for future generations.\n\nREAD ALSO:Police Special Squads arrest 4 robbery suspects in Lagos\n\nSpeaking at the opening session at St Paul\u2019s Anglican School, Orile Imo, Obafemi Owode, Ogun State, the Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager of Nestl\u00e9 Nigeria PLC, Victoria Uwadoka said, \u201cChildren must take an active part in ensuring a more sustainable approach to waste, and we are happy to help to prepare them for this important role. The Sustainability Training for Kids is specially designed to help children inculcate the right habits at an early age.\n\nOlumide Idowu, founder of the International Climate Change Development Initiative said, \u201cWe have a lot to learn about waste management and recycling to make the environment much safer. This is not just for us, but for the future generations. This is why this training is important to encourage children to do their part to save our planet.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Executive Secretary, Ogun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Mr. Olaleye Kuye said, \u201cOur collaboration with Nestl\u00e9 Nigeria PLC, has been mutually beneficial.\n\nI recall with special interest your interventions in the educational sector in Ogun State, especially through the Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids project which has contributed immensely to the wellbeing of our learners. Also, your intervention in the provision of toilet facilities and portable water for schools and communities is second to none and well appreciated\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s program therefore, provides yet another opportunity for all of us, especially our learners, to learn new things about our environment, especially human activities that impact negatively on the environment as well as positive actions and attitudes towards improving the state of our environment.\u201d\n\nThe maiden edition of the Sustainability Training for Kids which is being rolled out in Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids (N4HK) beneficiary schools will reach more than 150 primary 5 children in St Paul\u2019s Anglican School Obafemi Owode and Salvation Army Primary School 1, Agbara, both in Ogun State. Nestl\u00e9 for Healthier Kids (N4HK) is the company\u2019s flagship initiative which aims to help 50 million children globally lead healthier lives by 2030. In Nigeria, N4HK incorporates a school-based nutrition education program, which helps children imbibe healthy habits including good nutrition, active lifestyles through adequate physical activity, good hygiene practices and healthy hydration.",

It may be the voice of democracy, but it remains one of the oldest and most dauntless foe of tyranny and those given to arbitrary display of power. The question then arises; \u201cwhat has tyranny to do with the current administration?\u201d\n\nBy the dictates of Sections 4, 5 and 6 the 1999 Constitution the country\u2019s administrative powers are shared between the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The administration of the country is the duty of all these three arms of government, and it is from the legislature that one controversial bill, which seeks to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, emanated. This bill gratuitously grants the media an endangered status thereby making the country\u2019s democracy to rock on its heels. The sponsor of the bill, which among other things encroaches on press liberty, is Hon. Olusegun Odebunmi from Oyo State. Although he did the spade work, the opinion of the public is that he is a stooge of government. It is believed that the presidency is behind it, but presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, has denied that. No one is convinced. In fact, it is thought to be a harsher and more dangerous variant of the notorious Decree 4 of 1984 authored by the Muhammadu Buhari military government when he unwisely tampered with the press as he promised. Old habits, Nigerians have begun to suspect, die hard.\n\nThe lawmaker, meanwhile, brimming with inexplicable confidence of suspicious origin, declared to general chagrin that no court of law could stop the Bill. The implication of this statement is that he does not believe that the jurisdiction granted to the courts by virtue of Section 6(6)(c) of the Constitution with respect to the resolution and adjudication of matters between the government and the people holds any water over his Bill despite the outcry that the Bill flies in the face of Section 39 of the Constitution. Section 39 of the constitution provides \u201cthat every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d It continues that \u201cevery person shall be entitled to own, establish and operate any medium for the dissemination of information, ideas and opinions: provided that no person, other than the Government of the Federation or of a State or any other person or body authorized by the President on the fulfilment of conditions laid down by an Act of the National Assembly, shall own, establish or operate a television or wireless broadcasting station for, any purpose whatsoever.\u201d That fundamental right is however derogated by Subsection 3, which notes that nothing in Section 39 shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society for the purpose of preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, maintaining the authority and independence of courts or regulating telephony, wireless broadcasting, television or the exhibition of cinematograph films; or imposing restrictions upon persons holding office under the Government of the Federation or of a State, members of the armed forces of the Federation or members of the Nigeria Police Force or other Government security services or agencies established by law.\n\nFundamental human rights are contained in Chapter 4 of the 1999 Constitution and are derogated mostly by Section 45 of the Constitution. But that derogation must be by a law that is reasonable in a democratic society. Any infringement on the freedom of the press can be a debilitating factor to democracy. For many years, Nigerians have observed that the Nigerian Judiciary is not independent because the president has the duty of ratifying appointments therein. To add the media into this slavish cocoon would be to sentence Nigerian democracy to perdition.\n\nAccording to Section 3 of the Bill, \u201cThe Council shall be charged with the duty to regulate the print media and related media houses; ensure truthful, genuine and quality services by print media houses and media practitioners; with the approval of the Minister in charge of information, establish and disseminate a national Press Code and standards to guide conduct of print media, related media houses and media practitioners; approve penalties and fines against violation of the Press Code by print media houses and media practitioners, including revocation of license; receive, process and consider applications for the establishment, ownership and operation of print media and other related media houses; with the approval of the Minister, grant print media and other related licenses to any application considered worthy of such; monitor activities of the press, media and other related houses to ensure compliance with the National Press Code for professional and ethical conduct, including the Nigerian Union of Journalists; serve as national consultant on any legislative or regulatory issues on media and related issues; research into contemporary press and media development and engage in updating press documentation and freedom; foster the achievement and maintenance of high professional standards by the press; review developments likely to restrict the supply through the press, of information of public interest and importance or which are liable to prevent free access of the press to information and advising on measures necessary to prevent or remedy such development; ensure protection of the rights and privileges of journalists in the lawful performance of their professional duties; enquire into complaints about conducts of the press and the conduct of any person(s) or organization(s) towards the press and exercising in respect of the complaints the powers conferred upon it under this Act; carry out such other activities as are necessary or expedient for the full discharge of all or any of the functions conferred on it under this Act.\u201d Put mildly, even an outright fascist government would wince to make this kind of law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Press Council, which the Bill sees to vivify, is antithetical to democracy, for it seeks to do more than it claims, which is to regulate the press. The wordings of the Bill mean that part of its functions will be to dictate who becomes a journalist and even to regulate what is defined as truth. Had this been an independent body set up by members of that profession \u2013 the fourth estate \u2013 it would have been a different matter, though no less objectionable; but the Bill proposes that the chairman of the Press Council be appointed by the president. Indeed, the proposal to set up such an anti-democratic council is reminiscent of the autocratic behaviours of dictatorial governments. Every abuse and arbitrary use of power is predicated on either the assumption of an ad infinitum occupation of the office wherein that power stems from or from the presumption that the abuser of power thereof has the capacity to waive justice for the grief caused.\n\n\u201cPower tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201d said Lord Acton. \u201cGreat men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority: still more when you super add the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the end learns to justify the means.\u201d In this, Lord Acton spoke no fallacy but one in the above quote credited to him, and that one fallacy may be itself the result of either a malapropism or the peculiarity of the Nigerian political sphere. Nigerian leaders, the country agrees, are not necessarily great men although they should be. To the contrary, historical precedence brings it home to the public that a good number of those who have journeyed through positions of power in Nigeria were self-serving individuals who freely and without charity looted the country into penury without the establishment of a philosophical, ideological or political legacy worthy of international commendation and merit.\n\nNonetheless, he is right. Political scientists measure the viability of political structures often through the lens of political institutions and then through the behaviours of those who occupy political offices. Herein the constitutions of most democracies, Nigeria included, provide the people with a remedy for bad governance \u2013 tenureship. An errant member of government may be impeached or recalled, and this medicine may be the cure to Hon Olusegun Odebunmi ailment and excesses. The ailment is undoubtedly caused by the false assumption of power, and it primarily afflicts democracies, but may be found upon inspection lurking in other systems of governments. It is symptomized by the sponsorship of frivolous bills even where the sponsor has no experience or training in the subject matter of the bill. The affliction may cause the sufferer to declaim scornfully that statutorily constituted methods of redressing or adjudicating administrative monkeyshines will come to naught. The remedy is simply to strip the wielder of such power of their authority.\n\nGumi again, and for wrong reasons\n\nFor his unguarded prattling on the Nigerian Army\u2019s involvement in banditry, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi was, on Friday, given a long overdue invitation by the Department of State Service (DSS) to their Kaduna premises. The belated but nonetheless valid invitation of the Islamic cleric followed months of repeated, unwanted and offensive interventions on matters of national security; a matter he is too involved in to speak circumspectly on with any objectivity or depth. He has insisted, however, that he was not invited or questioned by the DSS. About four months ago, he was of the opinion that the bandits should be granted amnesty. He has been known, in fact, to advocate for the bandits saying that they were the real victims and that those who referred to them as bandits were the true bandits. This has, of course, meant that he is now an authority on negotiation with bandits.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will become of this invitation, if indeed it was made. His understanding of justice, myopic as it is, was allowed to roam freely for a long time unchecked, and only when it hit the Nigerian Army was he reined in. His insensitive statements and suspicious approach to the delicate and frustrating matter of banditry went for a long time unattended. Beyond grilling him over his liberal allegations of army complicity in banditry, even though he claims his allegations were misinterpreted, it is hoped that the DSS will also glean enough information from the cleric to enable the authorities knock banditry into a cocked hat.",

          "title": "Anambra guber: Obiora Okonkwo, 15 others in epic battle FOR PDP ticket",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nIf the wordsmith, Dr. K.O. Mbadiwe were alive, he would have said, \u2018the come has come to become\u2019 for the Anambra State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as 16 governorship aspirants engage in an epic battle on who becomes the standard bearer of the party in the November 6, 2021 governorship election.\n\nFor about 14 years, the party has been hungry to take back the governorship seat it lost in June, 2007, but to no avail.\n\nIn 1999, Anambra was a PDP state, with Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju, and thereafter, Dr Chris Ngige and finally, Andy Uba. Since them, APGA has been in charge.\n\nIn this vein, the party is also launching a grand political onslaught to recover its \u2018 trophy\u2019, and the outcome of today\u2019s primaries will to a very large extent determine its fate at the election proper.\n\nOne characteristics of PDP in Anambra governorship election is that it is always crowded and costly, and this one is not an exception. More so, all the aspirants are fully equipped with heavy financial war chest and otherwise, to wage a successful battle to clinch the ticket.\n\nTake for instance, the party generated N356 million from the sale of forms. It had earlier pegged the expression of interest form at N1 million, compliance form at N5 million, and nomination form at N20 million.\n\nIn line with its affirmative action to encourage women to seek elective office, the party waved nomination fees for all female aspirants meaning that the three ladies paid a total sum of N18 million only, being payment for obtaining expression of interest and compliance forms.\n\nSo far, the party\u2019s supporters are looking forward to a free, fair and successful screening and primaries scheduled for June. Emerging feelers indicate that the leadership of PDP may settle for a consensus candidate at the end of the entire exercise to prevent the constant crises that have bedeviled the party over the years following the outcome of its selection process.\n\nThe All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) insisted on zoning arrangement that has been in place, which means Anambra South district should produce the governor. This was the reason among others that Prof Charles Soludo emerged its candidate.\n\nHowever, the PDP may not likely consider zoning, as some of the aspirants are not from Anambra South. The argument of some of the aspirants is that since the rotation has run its full circle, it can start from any zone. They insisted that competence and capacity should override any other consideration.\n\nAs expected, each of them has since launched discreet strategies to scale through today\u2019s primaries.\n\nFor the party, a crucial question borders on the issue of who among the aspirants is better equipped and positioned to emerge victorious at the end of the entire exercise, and who has the capacity to beat Soludo, who has the emerged candidate of the ruling party, and that of the APC candidate that would emerge at the end of today.\n\nThe aspirants who have reportedly undergone the screening exercise and ready for today\u2019s primaries are: Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, a billionaire, who recently floated an airline. Like other aspirants, he has promised to fix Anambra State if given the ticket.\n\nThis is the second time Okonkwo is positioning himself to take part in a governorship election in the state.\n\nThere is Senator (Iyom) Uche Ekwunife, who has also contested governorship election on the platform of Progressives People Alliance (PPA).\n\nDr. Tony Nwoye, one-time chairman of the PDP in the state, in 2014 contested on the platform of PDP. He defected to APC and was its candidate four years ago. She returned to PDP and is one of the aspirants.\n\nDr. Godwin Maduka, is a former APGA chieftain who joined the PDP sometime ago. This is the first time he is taking part in competitive politics on the platform of PDP. He is a medical doctor based in the United States of America.\n\nVal Ozigbo is the former Chief Executive Officer of Transcorp. He is also rich and well connected. This is the first time Ozigbo is making a bid for the PDP governorship ticket.\n\nChris Azubogu, a two-time serving member of the House of Representatives. He is young, energetic and would likely count on his experience as a long-serving member of the House of Representatives.\n\nChief Godwin Ezeemo, an industrialist and the former governorship candidate of the PPA, has since joined the PDP, where he is jostling for the ticket of the party.\n\nChief Emeka Etiaba, SAN, is the son of Mrs, Virginia Etiaba, deputy governor of the state, and later the governor for few months.\n\nDr. Ifedi Okwenna is a former Special Assistant (Political) in the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo and former Commissioner for Environment and Mineral Resources; Commissioner for Science and Technology, under the Peter Obi-led administration, and Secretary, Honorary Advisory Committee, to President Jonathan between 2012 and 2014.\n\nDr. Ugochukwu Uba is a former senator and businessman. He is the eldest of the Uba brothers. His younger brother, Chief Andy Uba is jostling to pick the APC ticket for the same governorship election.\n\nMrs. Chidi Onyemelukwe, is the daughter of the late Dr. Alex Ekwueme. She was the running mate to Henry Oseloka Obaze, the PDP candidate during the last governorship election.\n\nDr. Winston Udeh, a lawyer, architect, teacher and an investor with multinational corporations is also in the race.\n\nHon Chuma Nzeribe is a two-time member of the House of Representatives, is also aspiring to govern the state.\n\nMrs. Genevieve Ekwochi is a former Commissioner for Women Affairs in the state. She is one the female aspirants in the race.\n\nJohnny Maduafokwa, a technocrat and oil engineer is also running for the governorship.\n\nWalter Okeke, a businessman is also in the race.\n\nThe stage is set. Brady Nwosu, a political analyst is of the opinion that the likelihood of candidates stepping down in Anambra, where big ego and wealth are major considerations to aspirants rather than the reality of political calculations, is slim.\n\nSaid he: \u201cIn this direction, whoever emerged will find it an uphill task to placate the others to accept defeat in good faith and work for the general good of the party, if the process wasn\u2019t transparent enough to convince them.\n\n\u201cEven, the 10 aspirants from Anambra South, the zone that is favoured to present the candidate, bearing in mind the rotation principle in the state, may feel they have been given the short end of the stick if one of them doesn\u2019t clinch the ticket, and the corollary will be their disloyalty and uncooperative posture for the election proper.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022UN: 350,000 killed in North-east insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that Nigeria will soon prevail over the current security challenges facing it.\n\nHe anchored his optimism on various efforts by the federal government to tackle insecurity, including the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly for approval for the procurement of military hardware for the use of the military and other security agencies.\n\nOsinbajo, while hosting the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Ajakaiye, yesterday in Abuja rallied Nigerians to support the security agencies to ensure that Nigeria is safe.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the supplementary budget seeking approval for funds to enhance the capacity of the military and other security agencies is part of the concerted efforts of the federal government to beef up its response to the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also stressed the need for traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the federal government to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, even as the federal government is concerned about the security challenges, and will continue to ramp up efforts towards improving security nationwide, community efforts are also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\nHe stated that at the level of community there is a need to take decisive action, as most of the security issues occur at the community level.\n\nOsinbajo expressed happiness that his guest has set up a committee in his domain to tackle insecurity \u201cand that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community.\u201d\n\nHe added that the federal government will support the community in tackling its challenges, and is also working with the Ekiti State Government on dealing with insecurity, as well as various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, Ajakaiye thanked Osinbajo for granting his delegation audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (Vice President) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South-west are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain.\u201d\n\nUN: 350,000 Killed in North-east Insurgency\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) yesterday put the death toll from the ongoing conflict with terrorists in the North-east at about 350,000 people as of the end of 2020.\n\nIt, however, projected that should the insurgency continue till 2030, the fatalities could rise to over 1.1 million.\n\nAccording to a UNDP\u2019s report on the impact of the insurgency in the North-east region presented yesterday at a virtual meeting by the Country Director, Mr. Mohammed Yahaya, at least 35,000 people have so far been killed directly by the insurgents, with 350,000 said to have died indirectly as a result of the crisis.\n\nOn the socioeconomic impact of the crisis on states in the region, the report said $27.8 billion had been lost in GDP, plunging at least 1.4 million people into poverty.\n\nThe report showed that at least 1.8 million children in the North-east are not enrolled in schools as a result of the conflict.\n\nThe UNDP said: \u201cThe full human cost of the war is much greater.\n\n\u201cAlready, many more have died from the indirect effects of the conflict.\u201d\n\nIt cited damage to agriculture, water, trade, food and healthcare.\n\nChildren younger than five accounts for more than nine out of 10 of those killed, with 170 dying every day, the UNDP added.\n\nIf the conflict continues to 2030, more than 1.1 million people may die, the agency stated.\n\n\u201cDestruction and displacement have set back development in the region by decades, and continued conflict will only further scar the region,\u201d the UNDP said.\n\nThe report said since 2009, the devastating conflict in the North-eastern Nigeria has directly resulted in the deaths of approximately 35,000 people as a consequence of insurgency.\n\nThe report warned that indirect deaths, including disease and hunger resulting from the conflict\u2019s physical and economic destruction, already far outnumber those from direct causes.\n\nThe report: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019 added that critical aspects of progress and development, including GDP, poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, education, water availability and sanitation, may not return to pre-conflict levels even by 2030.\n\nUNDP stated that more than 90 per cent of conflict-attributable deaths are of children under the age of five.\n\nThe report said physical and economic destruction wrought by the insurgency had dismantled already fragile health and food systems.\n\nAccording to it, less than 60 per cent of health facilities in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States are fully functional, while a quarter are either completely destroyed or non-functional.\n\nThe report also lamented that attacks from insurgency have also led to massive internal displacement, with more than 1.8 million Nigerians displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, while the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) are located in Borno.\n\nThe study also showed that in addition, 1.8 million students were out of school in 2020, and without increased investment in development efforts, the average Nigerian in the North-east would have lost a full year of education by 2030.\n\nThe statement, however, acknowledged that Nigeria has made great strides in retaking and stabilising large areas of the region, stressing that continued investment in development from both national and international stakeholders is needed.\n\n\u201cWithout continued investment in development as a long-term solution, the protracted conflict in north-east Nigeria will continue to impact other parts of the country and the entire Sahel region.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for international partners and national stakeholders to ensure that funds are invested not only on life-saving and humanitarian needs but also on mid-and long-term development priorities in order to enable Nigeria to achieve the SDGs and attain the AU 2063,\u201d the report quoted UNDP Resident Representative, Yahaya, as saying.\n\nThe report noted that to overcome the conflict, development efforts need to be focused on the stabilisation of affected areas through a community-level approach that enhances physical security and access to justice, rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and basic service delivery as well as the revitalisation of the local economy such as market stalls, schools and police stations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Opposition to PIB grows with Shell\u2019s rejection of proposals on gas sector\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased global debt by $24 trillion, taking it to $281 trillion during the crisis.\n\nSpeaking at the 135th meeting of the Economic Commission Board (ECB) of OPEC, the cartel\u2019s Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, urged member countries to be wary of the inflationary effect of their borrowings as the $24 trillion is more than the United States annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nBarkindo spoke just as the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state, seeking a review of its provisions on the gas sector.\n\nBarkindo also reiterated his earlier position that oil demand will hit pre-pandemic levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 to exceed 99 million barrels per day.\n\nThe meeting of the ECB, the organisation\u2019s statutory economic think-tank, which meets in advance of the ordinary meetings of the OPEC conference, focused on reviewing the conditions of the global oil market, emerging trends related to the oil industry, including demand, supply and stock movements, as well as the recovery prospects for the world economy.\n\nBarkindo highlighted the contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) of participating countries, which continue to support the global oil market through voluntary production adjustments in the interest of market stability.\n\nOn OPEC forecast for demand recovery, Barkindo stated that the market optimism was a reaction to the more than 2.4 billion vaccine doses that have now been administered globally.\n\nAlso, there are signs that the international community is ramping up its support to developing countries to help bolster their acquisition of life-saving vaccines.\n\nHe said these efforts were drawing the world closer to bringing the pandemic under control, and thereby helping accelerate the global economic recovery, as the latest market developments point to much better conditions and improved prospects.\n\nOn market fundamentals, Barkindo stated that in terms of the global economy, the GDP growth forecast has risen from 4.4 per cent in November 2020 to 5.5 per cent in June 2021.\n\nHe added that an upward momentum into the second half of the year is being expected.\n\nHe restated his earlier forecast that China and the US will see the lion\u2019s share of growth in 2021, with China\u2019s economy expanding by 8.5 per cent and the US by 6.4 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, India, despite having to confront a devastating second-wave of COVID-19 infections is still forecast to achieve a growth of 9.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe forecast for world oil demand has decreased from 6.2 mb/d in November 2020 to 6 mb/d in June 2021. The outlook for later this year looks especially promising with demand slated to exceed 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter. This prospect would bring us back close to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there are now encouraging signs that the worst of the pandemic is over, but warned that it is too early to jump to conclusions, especially with uncertainties surrounding mutations.\n\nBarkindo said meanwhile, debt levels in major economies continued to rise, fuelled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes, with government debt levels, after the COVID-19 lockdowns, reaching their highest to date in both advanced economies and emerging market economies.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe absolute amount of global debt has increased by more than $24 trillion over the course of the pandemic \u2013 this is more than the annual GDP of the US. World debt now stands at $281 trillion, comparing to the annual world GDP of around $80 trillion. With this in mind, the risk of rising inflation in the months to come will need to be closely monitored.\n\n\u201cLooking at the world oil supply, non-OPEC supply growth was revised down from 0.9 mb/d in November 2020 to 0.8 mb/d in June 2021. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China and Norway, while US liquids supply is now expected to only grow by a marginal 0.03 mb/d y-o-y.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the return of Iranian production and exports will happen in a transparent and orderly fashion, supporting the deal by OPEC+ countries on ongoing efforts to rebalance the oil market and promote market stability.\n\nBarkindo also lauded the conformity to the production adjustments by member countries, which he puts at 114 per cent in April.\n\nOpposition to PIB Grows as Shell Kicks over Bill\u2019s Position on Gas Sector\n\nMeanwhile, Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state.\n\nThe company stated that the bill, if passed as it is, could throw the gas sector into more crisis and further stunt the growth of the sector, which the country is banking on for much of its revenue as the world moves towards cleaner sources of fuels.\n\nDuring the week, reports indicated that the bill, which has spent over 15 years in the National Assembly, may not be passed this month as promised by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, as key stakeholders pushed for final alterations to some specific parts of the document before it becomes law.\n\nSpeaking during an online forum organised by the British Nigeria Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, called for a conference of all stakeholders, to be called by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to resolve the differences.\n\nThemed: \u201cGas Economy: Maximising the Potential,\u201d the programme was overseen by the NBCC oil and gas group and attended, among others, by the Managing Director of the chamber, Mr Kayode Falowo, and Managing Director, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, Mr Tony Attah.\n\nOther speakers at the event were the President of the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA) and Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), Mr. Ed Ubong, and Gas Portfolio Manager, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mr. Yemi Famori.\n\nOjulari stated that the PIB as it is today is not enabling enough and not fully aligned with the direction that Nigeria has articulated around the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d as propagated by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe called for a further review of the PIB to ensure that it delivers and contributes to the ambition that Nigeria has set for itself to be in the class of Qatar and Australia whose economies are largely run on revenues from gas.\n\nAccording to him, with the condition set for exportation of gas resources by companies operating in the sector, the proposed petroleum governance bill will stifle competition.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terms and prices of gas development, especially for deep non-associated gas, need to be more competitive. Today, it is actually looking worse than it is in the current environment and that\u2019s an area that has not enjoyed a level of emphasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIB does not do any justice or to help to unlock the huge potential that we have in the non-associated gas environments. With the potential of gas to power our economy, the focus should be more on competitive discuss that will stimulate gas.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the version of the PIB that we have is not sufficient and will not enable us to incentivise investors to unlock the huge non-associated gas that we have.\u201d\n\nIn the domestic gas space, Ojulari said the PIB required the fulfilment of domestic gas obligation as a condition to export gas, which potentially puts long-term export gas supply at risk.\n\nHe added that the country needs to move away from the \u201cunproductive\u201d debate about satisfying local need before shipping gas abroad.\n\nHe called for a delicate balancing between the political drive and the business needs of the PIB, saying that many of those who discuss the matter are approaching it from the point of emotions, rather than reality.\n\nHe added: \u201c A lot of people who talk about the gas business in the gas value chain come from the emotional side. But emotion does not create a business, emotions do not attract investors, emotions do not sign contracts.\n\n\u201cSo, I will say that while we recognise those emotional elements, we need to create a platform where the companies and the entities that have these resources will come together in a conference facilitated by the minister of state and let us have that conversation.\u201d\n\nHe stated that everybody is currently doing the economics of the gas sector from their own point of view, and there\u2019s no consensus on the way forward for the gas sector in the PIB.\n\nHe wondered why the NLNG model was not adopted since it has been tested to be workable, explaining that there is sufficient gas resource that will meet both domestic and gas export.\n\nIn his remarks, Attah stated that energy has always been in transition, adding that there should be no surprise about the current talks about renewables.\n\nWith 7.8 billion persons on earth and an additional 2.8 billion by 2050, he said the world would always require energy to function, while gas will continue to be relevant.\n\nAccording to him, the energy of the future must look at the sustainability of the environment and which does not emit massive carbon like coal, oil and others.\n\nHe stated that gas is cheaper and could be either a transition or destination fuel, adding that a future without gas is almost inconceivable.\n\nBill to Be Laid Tuesday\n\nMeanwhile, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has assured the nation that the PIB would be laid on Tuesday by its joint committees on the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we are dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s on the PIB; the Petrol Industry Bill, and by the grace of God, our committees, the joint committees, will finish their work on it by the end of the week, hopefully. The reports would be laid on Tuesday in both chambers. This is what we have planned and this is what we\u2019re working towards.\u201d\n\nHe also said much work had been done on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and it would be passed before the National Assembly proceeds on its annual vacation next month.\n\n\u201cWe also have some work to do on the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. Our committee in the Senate and indeed, in the House have worked jointly and we have very little to do really, to get the reports and considered in the two chambers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that we\u2019ll do that before we go on our annual summer recess, which comes up on the 15th of July, by the grace of God. \u201cSo, before we go on summer recess, we should be able to pass the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly will also work on the confirmation of nominees for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commissionership as well as passing the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill sent to it last week by the president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Delta State Government yesterday called for the speedy reconstitution of the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to avert the 2016 experience when the resurgence of militancy plunged Nigeria into recession.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Dr. Kingsley Otuaro, while featuring yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, described the non-constitution of the board as a flagrant abuse of the commission\u2019s Act.\n\nHe said the situation was doing more harm than good to the oil-rich region.\n\nHe described as untenable, the assurance of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, that the board would be constituted after an ongoing forensic audit.\n\nOtuaro also allayed fears of a political storm in the state over the zoning arrangement for the governorship position, saying the issue would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe said the non-constitution of the board of the NDDC could trigger militancy in the region following the recent ultimatum issued by the Ijaw Youth Council and oil communities\u2019 rights activist, Chief Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo.\n\nHe stated that following Tompolo\u2019s ultimatum, Akpabio had engaged in wide consultations in the region.\n\nOtuaro said he was part of the consultative meetings and was also very much aware of the fact that consensus reached in the inner meetings was that the board would be constituted at the close of this month.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe expectation of all those who are involved in that critical engagement is that the board will be constituted at the close of this month.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything to the contrary, Senator Akpabio knows exactly what to do. He has to reach out because any gap in the circumstance will be misconstrued for something else.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in Delta State Government, we don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened in 2016 that boxed us up into a recessionary period, where there was a resurgence of militancy in the region. And then we observed the breaches of critical oil and gas facilities where the Trans-Forcados 48-inch line was breached and production output was cut.\u201d\n\nHe said the position of the state government was in tandem with the position held by critical stakeholders in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have a strong opinion that the long delay and the non-constitution or the substantive board of the NDDC is a flagrant abuse of the Act, establishing the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThat is the position of the Delta State Government and like you have said, the NDDC cannot be like a sole proprietorship business, because it is not meant to be so.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that South-south governors met and in their resolution, they affirmed that the board should be constituted immediately.\n\nThe governors, he said, also recommended that financial receipts in favour of the NDDC should be lodged in an escrow account, adding that this was borne out of the fact that the sole proprietorship leadership \u2013 the interim leadership of the NDDC is unknown to the NDDC Act.\n\nHe stated that the recent visit by Akpabio to the region for consultation had calmed frayed nerves as the government may not have contained the likely unwholesome situation that would have arisen.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of ultimatums given by the Ijaw Youth Council and some other critical stakeholders, including that of Government Ekpemupolo, is also in tandem with the position of the Senator Ifeanyi Okowa-led government and that of the South-south governors and that of PANDEF led by Chief EK Clark,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the state government was thankful to God that Akpabio, \u201cesteemed and distinguished for his transformation agenda while he was governor Akwa Ibom State had cause to come to the Niger Delta region to consult with the critical stakeholders and I\u2019m thankful to God that he came.\u201d\n\nOtuaro added that if the minister had sat in his office, there would have been some unwholesome scenes in relation to the ultimatum that they had given.\n\n\u201cSo I want to say that it is the expectation of the critical stakeholders that the board should be constituted,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the position that the board would be constituted when the government is done with the forensic audit, is untenable against the backdrop of the fact that the board can be constituted and the forensic audit can be going on.\n\nOn the rising tension over zoning of the governorship position and the recent dissolution of the cabinet by Okowa, the deputy governor said the situation would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe added that he reserved the right to run for the governorship election but was non-committal over whether or not he would run in view of the zoning arrangement in place.\n\nHe stated that it was within the powers of his boss to effect a change of cabinet.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is within the powers of the Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to dissolve his cabinet and reappoint those he feels very strongly that can help us deliver on a stronger Delta Agenda, because that truly is our agenda, one that truly is stronger and more secured Delta State for tomorrow.\n\n\u201cSo, that is in the exercise of his power and there\u2019s no problem about that and we are happy with it and I think the people are also happy with it.\n\n\u201cAs to the questions you have thrown up with regards to contesting or indicating interest, zoning and all of that, I don\u2019t want to get myself into all of that. I am a Deltan; I am a Nigerian, like any other person. So, we all have the rights to aspire to elective positions. I have the right to aspire within the context of the law. I can aspire. But it is not my place to tell you if I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning of the governorship seat to South, North or Central Senatorial Districts, are all politics.\n\nOtuaro stated that the leadership of the state, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will look into what is fair and just for the people of the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\n\n\u201cTwo, you cannot, in my view and judgment, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development.

          "title": "Derek Chauvin, ex-US policeman, jailed for 22.5 years over George Floyd's murder",
          "text": "Derek Chauvin, former Minneapolis police officer, has been sentenced to 22 years and six months in prison for the murder of George Floyd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelivering judgement on Friday, Peter Cahill, the presiding judge, said the sentence was not based on public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe sentence is not based on is emotion or sympathy, but at the same time I want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family. I acknowledge and hear the pain you are feeling,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cI am not basing my sentence on public opinion. I\u2019m not basing it on any attempt to send any message but based on specific facts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFloyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck, when he was arrested for allegedly spending a counterfeit $20 note in a shop.\n\nThe video of the incident in which Floyd pleaded, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d went viral and sparked major protests within and outside the US.\n\nAn autopsy later confirmed that the cause of Floyd\u2019s death was linked to pressure on his neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the trial, Floyd\u2019s family had said they wanted a maximum sentence \u2014 which is 40 years for a second-degree murder \u2014 for the convict, but prosecutors had asked for a 30-year sentence for Chauvin.\n\nSpeaking before the sentencing, Chauvin offered his condolences to Floyd\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cI do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There\u2019s gonna be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope things will give you some peace of mind. Thank you,\u201d the former officer said.\n\nThe Friday sentencing comes months after a jury at a Minnesota state court found Chauvin guilty on the three counts of murder levelled against him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former police officer had been charged with unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but had pleaded not guilty to all three charges.\n\nIn the verdict delivered by the jury in April 2021, Chauvin\u2019s bail was also revoked at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, in March, the city of Minneapolis approved the sum of $27 million as settlement, following the civil lawsuit filed by Floyd\u2019s family over his death in police custody.\n\nSpeaking further in his ruling on Friday, the judge said Chauvin\u2019s sentence was based \u201con your abuse of a position of trust and authority, and also the particular cruelty shown to Mr Floyd\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChauvin was also told to register as a predatory offender, and will be prohibited from owning firearms or ammunition following his sentencing.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Keith Ellison, Minnesota attorney-general, expressed hope that the judgement will bring about a rededication to societal change\n\n\u201cThe sentence that the court just imposed on Derek Chauvin \u2014 270 months \u2014 is one of the longest a former police officer has ever received for unlawful use of deadly force. Like the conviction of Derek Chauvin two months ago, today\u2019s sentencing is not justice, but it is another moment of accountability on the road to justice,\u201d Ellison said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see anyone lose their freedom but seeing somebody lose their life through torture over nine-and-a-half minutes is incomparably worse. Those minutes and seconds are sealed into the minds of people across the world who watched George Floyd die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy hope for Derek Chauvin is that he uses his sentence to reflect on the choices that he made on May 25, 2020. My hope is that he will find it within himself to acknowledge the impact of his choices on George Floyd, his family, fellow police officers in the world.\n\n\u201cToday is also an important moment for our country.

          "text": "Derek Chauvin, former Minneapolis police officer, has been sentenced to 22 years and six months in prison for the murder of George Floyd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelivering judgement on Friday, Peter Cahill, the presiding judge, said the sentence was not based on public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe sentence is not based on is emotion or sympathy, but at the same time I want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family. I acknowledge and hear the pain you are feeling,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cI am not basing my sentence on public opinion. I\u2019m not basing it on any attempt to send any message but based on specific facts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFloyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck, when he was arrested for allegedly spending a counterfeit $20 note in a shop.\n\nThe video of the incident in which Floyd pleaded, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d went viral and sparked major protests within and outside the US.\n\nAn autopsy later confirmed that the cause of Floyd\u2019s death was linked to pressure on his neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the trial, Floyd\u2019s family had said they wanted a maximum sentence \u2014 which is 40 years for a second-degree murder \u2014 for the convict, but prosecutors had asked for a 30-year sentence for Chauvin.\n\nSpeaking before the sentencing, Chauvin offered his condolences to Floyd\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cI do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There\u2019s gonna be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope things will give you some peace of mind. Thank you,\u201d the former officer said.\n\nThe Friday sentencing comes months after a jury at a Minnesota state court found Chauvin guilty on the three counts of murder levelled against him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former police officer had been charged with unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but had pleaded not guilty to all three charges.\n\nIn the verdict delivered by the jury in April 2021, Chauvin\u2019s bail was also revoked at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, in March, the city of Minneapolis approved the sum of $27 million as settlement, following the civil lawsuit filed by Floyd\u2019s family over his death in police custody.\n\nSpeaking further in his ruling on Friday, the judge said Chauvin\u2019s sentence was based \u201con your abuse of a position of trust and authority, and also the particular cruelty shown to Mr Floyd\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChauvin was also told to register as a predatory offender, and will be prohibited from owning firearms or ammunition following his sentencing.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Keith Ellison, Minnesota attorney-general, expressed hope that the judgement will bring about a rededication to societal change\n\n\u201cThe sentence that the court just imposed on Derek Chauvin \u2014 270 months \u2014 is one of the longest a former police officer has ever received for unlawful use of deadly force. Like the conviction of Derek Chauvin two months ago, today\u2019s sentencing is not justice, but it is another moment of accountability on the road to justice,\u201d Ellison said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see anyone lose their freedom but seeing somebody lose their life through torture over nine-and-a-half minutes is incomparably worse. Those minutes and seconds are sealed into the minds of people across the world who watched George Floyd die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy hope for Derek Chauvin is that he uses his sentence to reflect on the choices that he made on May 25, 2020. My hope is that he will find it within himself to acknowledge the impact of his choices on George Floyd, his family, fellow police officers in the world.\n\n\u201cToday is also an important moment for our country. The outcome of this case is critically important. But by itself, it\u2019s not enough. My hope for our country is that this moment gives us pause and allows us to rededicate ourselves to the real societal change that will move us much further along the road to justice.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting in a statement, Ben Crump, Floyd\u2019s family attorney, described the sentence as \u201chistoric\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis historic sentence brings the Floyd family and our nation one step closer to healing by delivering closure and accountability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor once, a police officer who wrongly took the life of a Black man was held to account.

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "Despite the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in major cities in Nigeria, foreign investors are still able to sniff untapped opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s transport and motorcycle industry.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the motorcycles usually imported from India, China, Indonesia, and Japan contributed N416 billion to the total imports in 2020, this is however a 14 percent drop from the N486 billion it contributed in the same period of 2019. The drop may be attributed to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 2018, it achieved N204 billion, which represented an increase of 183 percent from the N72 billion realised in 2017; although data for the second quarter of 2017 was not available.\n\nAn example of manufacturers looking to tap into this market is Hero MotoCorp, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of motorcycles and scooters, which has made investments to tap from Nigeria\u2019s $153 million two-wheelers industry through its specially made-for-Nigeria motorcycle named Hunter.\n\nThe Indian manufacturer recognised an active market in Nigeria which required specific conditions, as the machine offers multiple benefits of modern technology, best mileage, longer engine life, and a comfortable long seat at an attractive introductory price.\n\nThe machine also has a metallic bash plate protecting the engine on rough roads, a combi-lock to protect it from theft, and tyre pressure monitoring indicator (accessory) to prevent deflation and puncture while on rugged terrains. Furthermore, it has an industry-first 12-month or 75,000km Engine Warranty.\n\nBeyond the production of machines for Nigerian conditions, the company affirms that it is looking to grow its presence in Nigeria through the establishment of various outlets.\n\nRead Also: Manufacturers urge enabling policies, actions to drive economic growth\n\nAnil Sahgal, managing director, Automotive Division, Kewalram Chanrai Group, the exclusive distributor of Hero MotoCorp in Nigeria, says while they focus on satisfying consumers, the company aims to significantly increase its presence in the Nigerian market\n\n\u201cHero MotoCorp is also planning to have almost forty outlets in twenty towns across Nigeria and will have a pan-country presence through dealers and parts distributors. In addition, an extensive network of over five thousand trained technicians pan-Nigeria will ensure easy access to service and parts for all customers. Powerful Ride, Smart Technology, Unmistakably Stylish,\u201d he states.\n\nIn recent years, the importation of motorcycles in Nigeria has been significantly driven by rising urbanisation, growing youth population, and increased businesses and investment.\n\nThis also presents an opportunity for more investors to come in as the Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report by Market Research reveals that the sector has a promising future in the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria two-wheeler market is projected to surpass $153 million by 2023. Growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria has been backed by their higher fuel efficiency and easy manoeuvrability.\n\n\u201cMoreover, their affordability coupled with rising prices of passenger cars are further anticipated to contribute to the growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria over the next five years,\u201d the report states\n\nEconomic experts believe that the coming of Hero will reduce the country\u2019s unemployment rate, which currently stands at 33 percent and in the same vein boosts economic activities through the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nFollowing the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in Lagos, the most populated and the busiest city in Nigeria, the ingenuity of Nigerians was piqued and this resulted in a boom in the logistics services industry.\n\nWith a minimum of N700 and a maximum of N3,000, depending on the location, urgency, and package, people can easily send and receive products in less than 24 hours. The sector has become increasingly competitive with the increase in the number of entrepreneurs, particularly online vendors.\n\nAlthough motorcycle imports have increased despite the ban, this has simply fuelled activities in the logistics industry. This has also prompted manufacturers of motorcycles like Hero MotoCorp to still see limitless opportunities in the Nigerian market.\n\nGoldStein Market Intelligence in its Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report reveals that as of 2019 Nigeria held the position of the second biggest market in Africa\u2019s two-wheeler industry; hence it has captured the attention of Chinese and Indian manufacturers\n\n\u201cNigeria represented the second-biggest offer in the African Two-Wheeler Market in 2019, this was due to insufficient public intra-city transport framework, expanding monetary action and rising interest for last-mile conveyance purpose,\u201d it states\n\nThe report also projects that the industry is also expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.31 percent.\n\nDespite the huge demand for motorcycles, Nigeria relies on the importation of Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts from Asian countries, which are assembled in the country.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Thursday launched the online Portal for the continuous voters registration exercise nationwide.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure at the national headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the register of voters is at the heart of democratic elections, stating that \u201ca good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. For this reason, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn exercising its powers under the law, the Commission undertook a fresh registration of eligible voters with every General Election until 2011 when the first reliable biometric register of voters was compiled. Thereafter, the Commission embarked on intermittent registration of voters on the eve of major elections. However, in April 2017, this Commission for the first time began the implementation of registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act. As a result, 14,283,734 new voters were added to the register by the time the process was suspended in August, 2018 in order to prepare for the 2019 General Election\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also said that, Monday 28th June 2021 remains sacrosanct, as the registration of voters will commence in full nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED). This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM)\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that in the Commission\u2019s determination to serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online. We hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience.\n\nThe exercise according to the Commission will be carried out continuously over a period of at least one year thereby, providing enough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. \u201cNo eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised, the chairman noted.\n\nThe chairman also allayed the fears expressed by some Nigerians that many citizens may be disenfranchised by the new digital arrangement pointing out that, the Commission is aware that not all Nigerians have computers, smart phones, access to the internet or residing in urban and sub-urban areas. Some citizens may also have one form of disability or another to make it impossible for them to register online.\n\nThe Commission, Yakubu said is also aware of its responsibility under the law to provide every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register irrespective of where they live or other circumstances of life. \u201cI wish to assure you that in addition to the online registration portal, there will be some 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically nationwide\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

Kennedy Airport as he prepared to fly to Nigeria by way of Amsterdam, federal authorities said.\n\nHe was charged after allegedly stealing over $350,000 in jobless benefits from the Washington state Employment Security Department in 2020.\n\nHe was also accused of trying to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of nearly $1.6 million, authorities said.\n\nA federal judge in New York in May ruled that Rufai could be released before trial on a $300,000 \u201csurety\u201d bond, but delayed the release to let federal prosecutors appeal.\n\nIn his decision Friday, Settle found that the \u201cdefendant poses a serious risk of nonappearance.\u201d\n\nTacoma attorney Lance Hester, one of Rufai\u2019s lawyers, said Rufai could ask the court to reconsider Friday\u2019s ruling if there were changes in his circumstances.\n\nFederal officials have called Rufai the first \u201csignificant\u201d arrest related to Washington\u2019s fraud.\n\nWashington state was severely victimized by fraudulent claims for pandemic-related benefits.\n\nIt likely paid out more than $647 million in such fraudulent claims, though $370 million was recovered, according to state officials.\n\nAnother lawyer for Rufai, Michael C. Barrows, has said his client \u201cdenies any involvement in these transactions.\u201d\n\nThe case has shed light on how criminals were able to file bogus unemployment claims in dozens of states.\n\nRufai allegedly employed a feature of Gmail, Google\u2019s free email service, that let him use a single email account to file multiple unemployment claims in Washington and elsewhere using stolen Social Security numbers and other personal data.\n\nThat same technique was allegedly used by Chukwuemeka Onyegbula, a 38-year-old IT engineer at a Nigerian oil company, Pan Ocean Oil Corporation to steal roughly $290,000 in unemployment insurance benefits from Washington and other states.\n\nHe also stole around $53,000 in federal disaster loans, according to an indictment returned Wednesday in federal district court in Tacoma.\n\nProsecutors have not suggested a link between the two men. Court documents have not listed an attorney who might comment on Onyegbula\u2019s behalf.",

Projects Consultancy Limited and Ranez Medical Consultancy Limited.\n\nOne of the counts reads: \u201cAndrew Warri, A.M. Projects Consultancy Limited, sometime in May 2012 in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, with intent to defraud, fraudulently obtained the sum of N125,000,000 from Guaranty Trust Bank Plc under the guise that the proceeds of the Rural Health Care and Referral contract with Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will be domiciled in your account with Guaranty Trust Bank, the said pretense you knew, or ought to have known is false.\u201d\n\nAnother count reads: \u201cAndrew Warri, Ranez Medical Consultancy Limited, on or about 28th October 2018 in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, issued a Zenith Bank cheque for the sum of N10,000,000 payable to A.M.

          "title": "TB Joshua Is Not A Real Man Of God, He Sexually Molested Me For 14 Years \u2013 Former Assistant, Bisola Johnson Spits Wild Allegations",
          "text": "TB Joshua, the late general overseer of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations, has been accused of some outrageous claims.\n\nBisola Johnson, his former aide, claims that TB Joshua sexually assaulted her numerous times throughout their 14-year relationship.\n\nShe claimed that the well-known man of God has a s3kz ring that allowed him to have his way with young virgins whenever he pleased.\n\nFollowing the death of the Synagogue\u2019s general overseer, a slew of allegations and information ranging from good to terrible has been generated about him, but this new one surpasses them all.\n\nJoshua was a serial s*sexual abuser, according to Bisola, who spoke to Sinai Mountain Radio in the United States. She claimed that TB Joshua was particularly interested in having sex with virgins and young girls.\n\nBisola went on to say that she ended up working for the church after TB Joshua utilized her troubles to brainwash her into doing so when she went to the church for a spiritual encounter in her 20s.\n\nJoshua allegedly introduced Bisola to his hidden cult of young females with whom he sleeps whenever he feels like it, according to Bisola.\n\n\u201cIt was a service day, I didn\u2019t know he wanted to initiate me on that day. He asked for me and when I went, I didn\u2019t see him in the office that I used to know. I was ushered into his bedroom and he asked if I was afraid, I said no, I was fine. He then hugged me and said, I should go back to work,\u201d Bisola said.\n\n\u201cAfter 15 minutes, he called me again and this time, I saw him sitting with a white towel around his waist; I was standing at the door and he asked me to come in. I didn\u2019t want to go because I saw his towel had shifted and his manhood was showing. TB Joshua insisted, dragged me into his bedroom by force; that is when I knew it was intentional. He dragged my hand and placed it on his manhood and started rubbing it.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was struggling. I said even if such a thing will happen, it shouldn\u2019t be in the house of God. I was very scared for him and thinking God will take his power but not knowing that was the strength of his power,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like a pride there if TB Joshiua called you into his bedroom,\u201d She further alleged he impregnated numerous of those girls and they had to have abortions.\n\nBisola Johnson, who endured 14 years in that position before fleeing to create her own ministry, believes there are many other victims of Joshua\u2019s abuse who are frightened to speak up.\n\nWatch video below:",

          "title": "Hunger, starvation imminent over security concerns",
          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",

It is aimed at accelerating development at the bottom-levelled tier through the holistic participation of the local population. Several people have decried how the third tier of Government has been deprived, denied and dragged down by the other superior tiers in Nigeria.

As an authority in local government administration in Nigeria, It is necessary I join align my voice with others that for our local government to be efficient in administration and free from the unbridled interference \u2013 perhaps its hijack \u2013 by the state governments, there should be a clinical review of the constitution to make local governments truly autonomous especially on the issues of fiscal powers, functions and responsibilities.\n\nI opine strongly that the local government should be empowered to own the discretion and right to manage its resources by itself, just like the state government and Federal Government, the second and first tiers of government. The recent attempt by the House of Representatives to delist the local government as the third tier of government is not only shocking, disappointing, but in the eye of the sane public bereft of logic. It was as though in the minds of the proponents of the delisting, the third tier constitutes the bulk of the challenges Nigeria is faced with, hence the urgent need for its delisting or eradication. For the records, 52.68 per cent of the FAAC distribution goes to the Federal Government, 26.72 per cent goes to the state governments, while the remaining 20.60 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government, therefore leaving the local Government at the mercy of the State Government.\n\nThis is plus the fact that the state governments enjoy other means of funding. From the finance act 2020, 14 per centg goesto the Federal budget, 1 per cent to the Federal Capital Territory, 4 per cent to the Federal Inland Revenue Service being the Collector, and 50 per cent go to the State Government, 35 per cent to the local government. The 35 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government. This should bother every right-thinking Nigerian. Ideally the Local Government is supposed to be the delivery authority on Pre- primary, primary, adult and vocational education, agricultural and national resource development, primary health care, water systems, town planning, environment and public sanitation comprising the refuse collection and disposal, cemeteries and crematoria, slaughterhouses among other areas. Also parks and open spaces within the locality. It is very unfortunate, to say the least that almost all of these core duties of the local government have been taken over by the state government. The local government has been paralysed, and no wonder there is increase in crime since every criminal is from a locality. I hold a strong view that the effort of the state governments and local governments are supposed to be complimentary. The reason most minor roads are bad in Nigeria, even in Lagos, is because the Local Government System is near zero in capacity and competence.\n\nThe performances up and down the ladder are what is required for a working democracy that will allow everyone to benefit from its dividends. The National Union of Local Government Employees\u2019 Leadership was absolutely right when it warned the House of Representatives not to even entertain a debate of such matter, let alone giving it serious consideration. What we need an amendment of the constitution that will grant autonomy, more importantly the financial autonomy, to the Local tier, proscribe the State Independent Electoral Commission and allow local government elections to be conducted at the same time as the general elections.

What we have today as chairmen of local governments are special assistants to their various governors on community mobilisation with no executive power to really make things work for the progress of their local councils.

          "title": "Hong Kong pro-democracy paper Apple Daily confirms closure -NigPilot",
          "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily announced Wednesday it will print its final edition after authorities arrested staff and froze its assets using a sweeping new national security law, silencing the city\u2019s most China critical media outlet. The decision is the latest blow to Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and deepens unease over whether the international finance centre can remain a media hub as China seeks to stamp out dissent. Small crowds gathered outside the paper\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday evening, shouting messages of support and shining mobile phone lights as journalists put together the swansong edition. Reporters said they planned to print one million copies overnight \u2014 a staggering number given Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million population.\n\n\u201cI have tens of thousands of words in my heart but I am speechless at this moment,\u201d Ip Yut-kin, chairman of the paper\u2019s parent company Next Digital, told AFP. Apple Daily has long been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, with unapologetic support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China\u2019s authoritarian leaders. Those same leaders have used a new security law to bring about its rapid demise. Owner Jimmy Lai, currently in jail for attending democracy protests, was among the first to be charged under the law after its imposition last year. But the final chapter of the 26-year-old paper was written over the last week when authorities deployed the security law to raid the newsroom, arrest senior executives and freeze its assets. That last move crippled the paper\u2019s ability to conduct business and pay staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple Daily announced its closure \u201cout of consideration for the safety of its staff\u201d. Its website will go offline overnight. Some 1,000 people have lost their jobs. The government-run science park that hosts the paper\u2019s headquarters also chose Wednesday evening to announce that the company was in breach of its lease and that legal steps were being taken to seize the building. \u2018Chilling\u2019 \u201cHong Kongers lost a media organisation that dared to speak up and insist on defending the truth,\u201d eight local journalist associations said in a joint statement, as they called on colleagues to dress in black on Thursday. British foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused Hong Kong\u2019s authorities of spearheading a \u201cforced closure\u201d of the paper, describing it as \u201ca chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices\u201d.\n\nChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests. The prosecution of Apple Daily was sparked by articles and columns that allegedly supported international sanctions against China, a view now deemed illegal. Lai, chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung have all been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China\u2019s national security and remanded into custody. On Wednesday Yeung Ching-kee, one of the paper\u2019s top columnists, was arrested on the same charge. The decision to freeze Apple Daily\u2019s assets also laid bare the sweeping powers now at the disposal of Hong Kong authorities to pursue any company deemed to be a national security threat.\n\nMultiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city\u2019s mini-constitution. But many local and international outlets are questioning whether they have a future there. \u201cEvery journalist in Hong Kong now has a metaphorical gun pointed at their heads,\u201d Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school, told AFP. \u201cWhen the result of your writing can lead to lifetime imprisonment -\u2013 you are being censored. Apple will not be the last \u2014 just the latest.\u201d First trial Hong Kong has plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year. Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea. China and Hong Kong\u2019s authorities have hailed the security law for successfully restoring stability after the 2019 demonstrations and said media outlets must not \u201csubvert\u201d the government.\n\nAuthorities initially said the law would only target \u201ca tiny minority\u201d. But it has radically transformed the political and legal landscape of a city that China promised would be able to keep key liberties and autonomy after its 1997 return. On Wednesday the first trial under the new law got under way for a man accused of riding a motorbike into police officers. His trial is not being heard by a jury in a major departure from Hong Kong\u2019s common law traditions. His case is unusual because he is the only Hong Konger so far charged under the security law with an explicitly violent act. More than 60 people have now been charged under the law, including some of the city\u2019s best-known democracy activists, but their offences are related to political views or speech that authorities have declared illegal.",
          "summary": "Reporters said they planned to print one million copies overnight \u2014 a staggering number given Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million population.\nApple Daily has long been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, with unapologetic support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China\u2019s authoritarian leaders.\nBritish foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused Hong Kong\u2019s authorities of spearheading a \u201cforced closure\u201d of the paper, describing it as \u201ca chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices\u201d.\nChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests.\n\u201cEvery journalist in Hong Kong now has a metaphorical gun pointed at their heads,\u201d Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school, told AFP.",

Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitization were able to allay the fears of members,\u2019\u2019 Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute the huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility, and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nThe CECPC Chairman told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair, and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organized recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring the relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nSome members of the APC who attended the meeting include, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, Progressives Governors Forum, and Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, and Chairman of Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong.

          "title": "Russia Mandates Vaccinations for Some as Virus Cases Surge",
          "text": "They tried grocery giveaways and lotteries for new cars and apartments. But an ambitious plan of vaccinating 30 million Russians by mid-June still has fallen short by a third.\n\nSo now, many regional governments across the vast country are obligating some workers to get vaccinated and requiring the shots to enter certain businesses, like restaurants.\n\nAs many Western countries lift coronavirus restrictions and plan a return to normal life after mass vaccinations, Russia is battling a surge of infections \u2014 even though it was the first in the world to authorize a vaccine and among the first to start administering it in December.\n\nDaily new cases have grown from about 9,000 in early June to about 17,000 on June 18 and over 20,000 on Thursday, with Moscow, its outlying region and St. Petersburg combining for about half of all new infections.\n\nOfficials have blamed Russians\u2019 lax attitude toward taking necessary precautions and the growing prevalence of more infectious variants. But perhaps the biggest factor is the lack of vaccinations.\n\nOnly 20.7 million people, or 14% of its population of 146 million, have received at least one shot as of Wednesday, and only 16.7 million, or about 11%, have been fully vaccinated.\n\nExperts say those numbers are due to several factors, including the public\u2019s wariness of the rushed approval and rollout of the Sputnik V vaccine; an official narrative that Russia had tamed its outbreak; criticism on state TV of other vaccines as dangerous; and a weak promotional campaign that included incentives such as consumer giveaways.\n\nIn light of the surge, at least 14 Russian regions \u2014 from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the remote far-eastern region of Sakhalin \u2014 made vaccinations mandatory this month for employees in certain sectors, such as government offices, retail, health care, education, restaurants, fitness centers, beauty parlors and other service industries.\n\nMoscow authorities said companies should suspend without pay employees unwilling to get vaccinated, and they threatened to temporarily halt operations of businesses that don\u2019t meet the goal of having 60% of staff get at least one shot by July 15 and both shots by Aug. 15.\n\nAs of Monday, all Moscow restaurants, cafes and bars will admit only customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months, or can provide a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. City officials also limited most elective hospital care to those who are fully vaccinated or can provide tests showing they have antibodies to fight the infection.\n\nThe moves seem to be an act of desperation by authorities.\n\n\u201cThey backed themselves into a corner, they have no choice now,\u201d said Judy Twigg, a political science professor specializing in global health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\u201cThey overhyped this vaccine so that people didn\u2019t trust it. Then they took a series of measures that were clearly attempted to make it seem as though the government had everything under control, the pandemic was no big deal. \u2026 And now they\u2019re in this situation, not surprisingly, where low vaccination rates have left an opening for the delta variant to come in,\u201d she said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Thursday the vaccinations in Moscow were \u201cvoluntary,\u201d because those refusing to get the shot can still seek a different job.\n\nThe governor of the southern region of Krasnodar, home to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, said hotels and sanitariums will only accommodate vacationers with a negative coronavirus test or a vaccination certificate starting July 1. As of Aug. 1, only vaccinated individuals will be admitted.\n\nThe mandates have drawn mixed responses, with some saying they are welcome if they prevent closures of businesses, while other say it\u2019s unclear how employers can persuade those who don\u2019t want the shots.\n\n\u201cMost restaurateurs believe that vaccination is necessary,\u201d said Sergei Mironov, founder of a restaurant chain and vice president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers. \u201cBut it is necessary to create (the right) conditions for the vaccination (drive).\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are too many rumors, and even doctors say different things,\u201d and convincing younger employees to get vaccinated is especially difficult, he said.\n\nTatyana Moskalkova, the government\u2019s human rights commissioner, said the unvaccinated have cited discrimination by employers, with threats of dismissal or withholding bonuses.\n\nAt a TV awards ceremony Tuesday, popular actor Yegor Beroyev wore a yellow star akin to those worn by Jews under the Nazis in World War II, and he spoke of \u201cwaking up in a world where (COVID-19 vaccination) became an identification mark of whether you are a citizen, \u2026 will you be able to visit institutions and events, will you enjoy all the benefits and rights.\u201d\n\nAs proof of vaccination for entering a restaurant, customers must visit a government website and get a QR code, a digital pattern designed to be read by a scanner.\n\nRestaurant owners won concessions Thursday when Moscow agreed the QR codes aren\u2019t needed for the next two weeks at establishments with outdoor terraces, and underage customers won\u2019t have to provide documentation if accompanied by their parents.\n\nStill, the situation for many restaurants \u201cis hard and will be harder by the day,\u201d Mironov said.\n\nIn Moscow, online searches for fake inoculation documents increased shortly after the mayor announced mandatory vaccinations, social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova told an online lecture on vaccine hesitancy.\n\nPolice quickly cracked down, launching 24 criminal cases last week against sellers of fake vaccination certificates. Still, several accounts offering the bogus documents could be found easily on the Telegram messaging app this week.\n\nThe number of such offers has grown about 19% every month since March, said Evgeny Egorov, digital risk protection analyst at Group-IB, a Singapore-based cybersecurity company. In mid-June, Group-IB found at least 90 active offers, he said.\n\nThe independent pollster Levada Center said polls show about 60% of Russians are unwilling to get vaccinated.\n\nLevada director and sociologist Denis Volkov said the vaccination mandates could change the minds of many because it\u2019s a clear signal from the government that the shots are necessary.\n\n\u201cI often hear (from respondents) that they wouldn\u2019t do it, are afraid and so on, but if there are restrictions, and it is required for travel, state services, or at work, then yes,\u201d Volkov said.\n\nIt could be starting to change attitudes. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said the average vaccination rate across Russia has almost doubled in the past week, and long lines have been seen at pop-up vaccination clinics in Moscow shopping malls.\n\nA demand for vaccines could also lead to shortages. As of mid-May, just over 33 million doses were produced in Russia, and a significant amount was exported.\n\nSeveral regions have reported supply problems this week, but Peskov said those were \u201ctemporary logistical difficulties.\u201d",
