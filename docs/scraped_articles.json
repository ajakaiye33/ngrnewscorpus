          "text": "Yusuff Moshood\n\nA Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. Abayomi Ajayi has urged women with fibroids to seek medical intervention early, noting that there has been an increase in cases of women with bigger fibroids.\n\nAjayi who is the Chief Executive Officer of Nordica Fertility Centre Lagos said this might be because more women with fibroid are reluctant to come out for treatment because they are afraid of surgery.\n\nAccording to a 2010 World Health Organisation report, fibroids affects between 20-25 per cent of women, and close to 235 million women which represent 6.6 per cent of the global women population are estimated to have been affected worldwide\n\nSpeaking in a live TV interview monitored by PUNCH HealthWise on Monday, Ajayi said it is necessary for women with fibroid to know that that they now have other effective options for fibroid treatment aside from invasive surgery.\n\nAjayi said, \u201cI have been a gynaecologist for over 30 years, but the kind of fibroid that I have seen in the last three months I have never imagined they exist.\n\n\u201cI have seen big fibroid in my practice, but I am seeing bigger fibroid now. That tells me that there are a lot of women out there who are just afraid of surgery and are not ready to come out.\n\n\u201cBut, for such women what we are doing to help is to combine methods of treatment for them.\n\n\u201cEven though they have a very huge fibroid, but it can be broken down into stages.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we can combine minimally invasive surgery with non-invasive surgery to get what we need.\n\n\u201cSo the treatment of fibroid is like plotting the best way to deal with the issue rather than before when all we have was invasive surgery\u201d.\n\nWhile stressing that the treatment of fibroid has moved beyond surgery, Ajayi said, \u201cThere has been an evolution in the care of fibroid. Fibroid treatment moved from invasive to minimally invasive and now we are in non-invasive.\n\n\u201cThe minimally invasive is what we call keyhole surgery \u2013 that is laparoscopy and hysteroscopy.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the new era of non-invasive that we are, you could just lay down on the table for about one to two hours and after that, we tell you to stand up and that is all. You are good to go. We just ask you to rest in the clinic for like two hours before you go home.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that we are now using a machine that is called \u2018HYFO\u2019 \u2013 a high-intensity focus ultrasound machine. What it does is that it convert ultrasound to heat energy. It just burns off the fibroid\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further Ajayi stated that young black women are more susceptible to the condition.\n\nHe said, \u201cFibroid is the commonest tumour in women of reproductive age group. Black women have a 70 to 80 per cent lifetime risk of having fibroid by the time they are 50 years\u201d.\n\nHe, however, caution against removing fibroid without considering other important related issues.\n\n\u201cOne thing I would like to tell people is that it is not every fibroid that you need to remove. You have to examine the fibroid and the patient and ask the patient some important questions.\n\n\u201cDo you have symptoms? How old are you? Do you want to be pregnant? Where is the fibroid? Those are some of the questions we need to answer before we can determine what is to be done.\n\n\u201cAnd the most important thing is how is it affecting the quality of life of the patient. Once it is affecting the quality of life, then you have to act,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Ajayi also noted that the commonest symptoms of a fibroid are related to menses.\n\n\u201cIt is either pain or heavy flow or you have pressure. Sometimes for some women, they start having symptoms similar to that of men with prostate.\n\n\u201cThere was a case of a woman that has a full bladder but she could not pass it because the fibroid has occluded where the urethra and the bladder joined. In such a case, you have to act,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

He said some of the others were Archbishops Joseph Ukpo, late Ephraim Obot late Alexius Makuoze among others.\n\nDelivering a homily at a service to mark the 50th Episcopal anniversary and 90th birthday of Ekpu at St Paul Catholic Church in Benin City, Onaiyekan said the era coincided with the Nigerianisation policy of the country in the early seventies and at a time the Catholic was also undergoing reformation which gave room for Nigerians to take over the leadership of the church.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe year 1971 was a tremendous year for the church in Nigeria when seven young Nigerian priests were appointed bishops.\n\n\u201cOur young bishop took the helms of leadership of their dioceses at a delicate period in the history of the church, it was just a few years after the end of the second Vatican council, a period of uncertainty and instability as the church groped her way to implement the truly revolutionary changes that the council had decreed very significant among such changes was the need to adapt the church to the realities of our times and the realities of our native laws and customs in every aspect of church life.\n\nIt was also the era of local music and instrument, it was the era of review of the administrative structure, the bishop had to ensure that all these were done without departing from the essence of our catholic faith and tradition we can now safely say that our young bishops proved themselves better qualified to do this than any foreign born.\n\n\u201cThe young bishops were plunged into a challenging socio-political period many wise men in the world\u2019s way but of little faith did not expect them to successfully cope with the demand of their high office but God\u2019s ways are not our ways looking back now, 50 years down the line we can see that the Holy Spirit did not make a mistake they have led the churches entrusted to their care successfully until their meritorious retirement at the full age of 75. Not every former office holder deserves the title emeritus.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, the Archbishop of Benin Diocese and president Conference of Catholic Bishops, His Grace, Dr Augustine Akubeze said Ekpu invested in human development and the growth of the people of God.\n\nOn his part, Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki described Ekpu as one who served in various local communities as a young priest understanding the customs of the people and bringing them to God describing as \u201cWe will continue to tap from wisdom to guide us as we pass through difficult times.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, said a joint panel recovery unit of the Ministry of Justice, comprising the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), police and Ministry of Justice, was behind the invasion of the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt said the establishments sought a search warrant from an FCT Magistrate for the operation after \u201ca so-called whistleblower claimed to have observed illegal activities allegedly going on in a house at Imo street, Maitama.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nIt condemned the invasion and demanded that all those involved be apprehended and prosecuted.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had denied involvement in the raid. Malami and Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP) have ordered probes into the incident.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nHowever, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, the upper legislative chamber condemned the invasion and mandated the IGP to make public all findings of investigation into the matter.\n\nIt commended the police for making arrests and constituting a panel to investigate the raid on Odili\u2019s residence.\n\nThese formed part of resolutions reached by the Senate, following a point of order raised by Betty Apiafi during plenary. While coming under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, she moved a motion on the \u201cUrgent need to investigate the invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s residence by security agents.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, in her motion, noted that on October 29, 2021, security operatives invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe senate is worried that this incident brings back to mind similar invasion of homes of some senior judicial officers, including chief judges of the Supreme Court and judges of the Federal High Court in Abuja and other parts of the country in October 2016, which was widely condemned.\n\n\u201cFurther worried that the home of such a highly revered judicial officer could be raided in such a manner by security agents. The senate is disturbed that 11 days after the incident, though the Inspector General of Police claims some arrests have been made and investigations are still ongoing, even though the details of such arrest have not been made public.\u201d\n\nMichael Bamidele, who chairs the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, said no member of the upper chamber \u201cwas at ease hearing the news of what happened.\u201d\n\nHe said the motion presented by Apiafi represented the collective desire of members of the National Assembly in ensuring that the government takes appropriate steps to bring to book all those found culpable. He said doing so would send a clear signal on the need to respect the sanctity of the judiciary and to also protect judicial officers in Nigeria, whose rights under the law must be protected.\n\nGeorge Sekibo recalled that the Port Harcourt residence of Justice Mary Odili was invaded a couple of months ago.\n\n\u201cSeveral reasons were given why thugs invaded the house. I don\u2019t want to mention the reasons so that it does not bring in controversy. Recently, as the motion said, the house in Abuja was also invaded. (And) then after a struggle, the security agents that invaded the place left the residence. They claimed to have brought a warrant from a Magistrates Court in Abuja. They claimed the Minister of Justice was aware of it. There are several claims. The minister of justice has denied and dissociated himself from that, the chairman of EFCC has also done that. I have read statements by the Inspector General of Police that he has made some arrests and that they are investigating the matter. My problem is this; oftentimes, things happen and then police investigates, and in most cases, we don\u2019t get the result of the investigation. I pray that this investigation comes to limelight.\u201d\n\nThe senate asked the IGP to disclose the findings of the investigation as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has charged the IGP to investigate the circumstances leading to the disappearance of Mr. Tordue Salem, an Abuja-based Vanguard newspaper reporter.\n\nThis followed the adoption of a point of order by Orker-Jev Emmanuel Yisa (Benue- North).\n\nCiting order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, Yisa said Salem, before his disappearance, was a journalist with the Vanguard newspaper covering the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cOn October 13, between 8-9p.m, Salem went missing and all phone contact with him ceased.\u201d\n\nHe said efforts by his family, friends and colleagues to trace his whereabouts have proved abortive. He, however, expressed optimism that the intervention of the senate would persuade the police to get to the root of the matter.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Assembly charged various security agencies to probe the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the journalist.\n\nIt mandated its Committees on National Security and Intelligence, Police, Defence and Interior to interface with security chiefs and report back to the House within two weeks.\n\nThe House, while describing the journalists disappearance as worrisome, expressed dismay with the spate of insecurity in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, stating that the city had become unsafe with kidnappings and banditry becoming regular occurrences.\n\nThis followed the adoption of a motionby the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu titled: \u201cA Case of Missing Journalist, Need to Investigate Circumstances Surrounding the Disappearance.\u201d\n\nElumelu, in his lead debate, said it was imperative for security agencies to take urgent steps to stem the disappearance of innocent Nigerians in Abuja.\n\n\u201cMr Tordue Salem is a member of the House of Representatives press corps and he reports for the Vanguard Newspaper. Mr Salem reported for work at the National Assembly premises on Wednesday the 13th of October and was last seen in Garki District of FCT before his alleged disappearance same day.\n\n\u201cHis disappearance was immediately reported to the relevant security agencies as all efforts by both friends and family to reach him have been abortive. In spite of official effort by the leadership of the House to galvanise the security agencies at promptly resolving his disappearance, there\u2019s been no headway. This sudden disappearance is an extension of the deteriorating state of insecurity in the nation\u2019s capital and again questions the efficiency of the country\u2019s security operatives.\n\n\u201cIf necessary measures are not put in place to curtail the indiscriminate disappearance of innocent Nigerians living in Abuja , the federal capital may soon become a breeding ground for kidnappers and bandits, hence the need for an urgent investigation.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Click Here to Apply .\n\nBuhari, who was represented by Governor Simon Lalong noted that the agricultural sector is one of the critical non-oil sectors which has made significant contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) accounting for a 22.35 per cent and 23.78 per cent contribution to the overall GDP in the first and second quarters of 2021 respectively.\n\nHe said a key focus of his administration has been the deployment of mechanisms to ensure agriculture thrives to significantly grow the economy and achieve maximum welfare for the citizens by ensuring food and energy security.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nBuhari said Nigeria was on the path to actualising sustainability in the production of rice, maize, cassava, soybean, groundnut, oil palm, cocoa and soon the breakthrough in wheat cultivation would be accomplished.\n\nHe lamented that Nigeria still spends humongous amounts of money on wheat importation which is not acceptable because the country has the capacity to meet domestic consumption demands and also export.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stress that Nigeria currently spends over $2 billion on the importation of wheat annually, one of the key contributors to the nation\u2019s huge foreign import bill. This is because millers have had to resort to importation to meet the huge demand for wheat by-products. Wheat cultivation, similar to rice, has the capacity to thrive in Nigeria due to the tropical climatic conditions. Currently, wheat is cultivated in many northern states particularly in the dry season due to the high heat tolerance of the seed utilised by farmers.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that wheat can also be grown in the wet season in Plateau State as research showed that it can be cultivated in other areas in the country, namely, Gembu Plateau, Taraba State and Obudu in Cross River State.\n\nBuhari commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for using the Anchor Borrowers Programme not just in the agriculture value chain but in almost all sectors of the economy as shown in the recent launch of some transformative initiatives like the 100 for 100 policy for production and productivity.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who was represented by his deputy, Edward Lamtek Adamu, said in order to change the situation and leverage domestic production to bridge the demand-supply gap, CBN decided to add wheat to the list of focal commodities to be supported under its agricultural intervention programmes.\n\nHe said improved seeds varieties of high yielding varieties from Mexico with potential average yield per hectare of 5-7 metric tons as against a range of 0.8-1.8 metric tons yield per hectare of those varieties previously cultivated have been acquired for distribution to farmers.\n\nHe also assured that the two-pronged approach of seed multiplication and grains production, which has been adopted is expected to sustain the propagation of seeds and guarantee availability of high-yielding seeds to farmers.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

I wished him well and prayed for his success.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to congratulate all the men and women who contested our dear state\u2019s governorship this year. You all have shown a determination to see that Anambra is better. It was an honour to run this race with you.\u201d\n\nHe said that he decided to go into partisan politics two years ago, and that in doing so, he had a number of objectives in mind, including to use Anambra to set an example of excellence in governance, to unify Anambra and Igbo land around a shared vision of greatness, and to inspire more professionals to go into politics.\n\n\u201cPulled by the vision of a better and brighter Anambra, we set out on the quest for governorship, resolute on taking revolutionary steps to address the decay and decline in security, infrastructure, education, healthcare, the environment, and all other social systems meant to serve the people.\n\n\u201cAs laid out in our Ka Anambra Chawapu Manifesto, we planned to transform Anambra into the most competitive sub-national economy in Nigeria by opening up public, social, and commercial spaces leveraging on the strength of our youth and women. Ultimately, to make Anambra the pride of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGiven where we started and where we are today, we consider ourselves winners. Our Ka Anambra Chawapu message has permeated the consciousness of Ndi Anambra, and the nation at large. It is the strongest message that has come out of Anambra 2021, and it continues to beat in the hearts of Ndi Igbo,\u201d he said.\n\nOzigbo said within the period of the election, he met people who wondered how he could perform so well in his first attempt, adding that he documented his grand vision for a brighter and better Anambra and presented it to the people with the energy to implement it.\n\n\u201cThough we may not have the opportunity in the immediate to get it started, we will be holding the government in power accountable to ensure that the welfare of the people is foremost in their actions at all times,\u201d Ozigbo said.\n\nHe added that the election was fraught with lots of shortcomings on the part of various government institutions, including security, electoral commission, vote buying and many others.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies failed to provide a peaceful environment for campaigns to hold. On election day, they were absent from many polling centres leading to elections not holding or held in situations that allowed for chaos and fraud.\n\n\u201cThe national electoral commission presented untrained and poorly trained staff who could not operate the voting machines in many places. They failed woefully in providing logistical support for their staff and so elections started very late in many places and did not hold in many others.\n\n\u201cThe use of government funds and resources to corrupt, coerce and intimidate voters, PDP party agents, and electoral officials was a major factor in determining the outcome of this election.\n\n\u201cAll of these led to the disenfranchisement of the greater percentage of voters and staining the course of democracy. I will be dedicating time to champion the positive change we need to ensure that future elections are truly free and fair and that the will of the electorate prevails.\n\n\u201cDenominational politics was also a factor. We need to do a lot more to ensure that competence is never sacrificed on this altar, and that democracy is practised in line with its truest tenets.\n\n\u201cIn all, I am more determined to working for a better future for our children by remaining in active politics and rebuilding our party to be more united and more robust for those who come after us,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Unveils Strategy to Cut Wheat Importation by 60% in Two Years",
          "text": "\u2022Initiative to save $2bn FX annually\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday flagged-off the first ever rain-fed wheat programme in the country, which aims to slash the importation of the commodity by 60 per cent in two years.\n\nThe initiative is also expected to save the country $2 billion annually in foreign exchange.\n\nSpeaking in Jos, Plateau State, during the unveiling ceremony for the Nigerian Brown Revolution, which is a central bank wheat value chain intervention, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said following the successes in the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), the apex bank decided to extend the gains recorded in the rice and maize value chains to wheat production.\n\nHe said the plan was to ultimately eliminate wheat importation or reduce it to an insignificant contributor to the country\u2019s total food import bill, adding that the wheat programme would benefit over 150,000 farmers.\n\nHe also said the programme would be implemented in 15 states on about 180,000 hectares of land.\n\nEmefiele said the programme would address the impact of wheat importation on foreign exchange.\n\nRepresented at the occasion by CBN Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate, Mr. Edward Adamu, the CBN governor said the country spends about $2 billion annually importing 5.2 metric tonnes of the commodity to meet local demand.\n\nHe said the programme was expected to add about 2,000 metric tons of seeds to the nation\u2019s national seed stock and potentially add 750,000 metric tons of wheat to national output annually through rain-fed wheat cultivation in Plateau, Mambila Plateau and Obudu Plateau in the short-term.\n\nEmefiele, however, pointed out that wheat remained the third most widely consumed grain in the country after maize and rice.\n\nHe said the country only produces about one per cent (63,000 metric tons) of the 5-6 million metric tons of the commodity consumed annually in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the enormous demand-supply gap was bridged with over $2 billion spent annually on wheat importation, making wheat the second highest contributor to the country\u2019s food import bill.\n\nHe said given the high growth rate of the country\u2019s population and the demographic structure, the demand for wheat was projected to continue to rise, thereby intensifying pressure on the country\u2019s reserves unless a decisive step is taken to grow the commodity locally.\n\nEmefiele, also pointed out that over the years, the availability of low-yielding seeds variety locally and poor agronomic practices had hampered successful cultivation of wheat in the country, leading to low productivity as well as making wheat production unappealing to farmers and unattractive for private sector investment.\n\nHe added that the CBN, in order to change the narrative and leverage domestic production to bridge the demand-supply gap in the country, decided to add wheat to the list of focal commodities to be supported under the bank\u2019s agricultural intervention programmes.\n\nHe stressed that improved seeds varieties constituted the bedrock of any crop production process, adding that the country had made some progress with regards to acquisition of high yielding varieties from Mexico with potential average yield per hectare of 5-7 metric tons as against a range of 0.8-1.8 metric tons yield per hectare of those varieties previously cultivated.\n\nEmefiele said the two-pronged approach of seed multiplication and grains production already adopted is expected to sustain the propagation of seeds and guarantee availability of high-yielding seeds to farmers.\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s strategy for the wheat value chain involved\n\nensuring availability of high-yield seeds by financing seed multiplication and establishment of seed ripple centres.\n\nOther are expanding land under cultivation for wheat to a capacity that could meet total national demand through association and collaboration with relevant federal agencies and state governments.\n\nHe said the strategy was to also pursue strategic collaboration with key stakeholders in the wheat value chain for sustained local production.\n\nEmefiele, however, said food security remained a major delivery for governments across the globe, hence the bank was supporting the efforts of the federal government by providing affordable and accessible financing options to drive domestic food production.\n\nHe said the ABP remained a game changer in financing smallholder farmers through innovative funding models centred around building an effective agro-ecosystem, hinged on the value chain approach.\n\nHe said the ABP had recorded successes in supporting smallholder farmers to increase the cultivation of different commodities across the 36 States of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe governor said through the programme, N788.035 billion had been disbursed to about four million farmers through 23 Participating Financial Institutions (PFI).\n\nHe said so far, 4.796 million hectares of farmlands had been cultivated under the programme covering 21 commodities.\n\nHe said the flag-off of the wheat programme was auspicious in a lot of ways as it heralds the commencement of the Brown Revolution Journey, which is the CBN\u2019s mantra for repositioning wheat production in the country.\n\nHe said it was also the first major wet season wheat production in the country with about 700 hectares put under cultivation in Kwall, Kassa, Jol, Kafi Abu and Sop in Jos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN will not rest on its oars as we continue to work with our partners, Lake Chad Research Institute (LCRI), to expand the frontiers of wheat production in Nigeria to areas like northern Oyo, Kogi and Kwara states.\n\n\u201cThe wheat fields you are seeing here today are historic and further underscore the enormous potentials in our agricultural landscape.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that with the right technology and agronomic practices, we can change the narratives and develop two wheat cropping cycles to support an aggressive drive to bridge the wheat demand-supply gap in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022I\u2019ll never disappoint you, says winner\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong,\n\nChuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nCandidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, has emerged Anambra State governor-elect, after winning yesterday\u2019s supplementary election in Ihiala Local Government Area of the state with 8,283 votes.\n\nThus, overall, Soludo won 19 out of the 21 local governments in the state and polled a total of 112,229 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Valentine Ozigbo, with 53,807 votes.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Andy Uba, came a distant third with 43,285 votes, while the Young Progressive Party\u2019s candidate, Ifeanyi Ubah, scored 21, 261 votes.\n\nBased on this, the Returning Officer and Vice Chancellor of the University of Calabar, Professor Florence Obi, pronounced Soludo winner of the election, having satisfied the constitutional requirements, and after three days of waiting to conclude the exercise.\n\nObi, who announced the result at about 1.50 this morning after adding the figures garnered by each of the political parties in the supplementary poll to those already declared on Sunday from the 20 local government areas, said the total number of valid votes in the election was241,523; rejected votes stood at 8,108, while the total vote cast was 249,631.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment we have been waiting for. I want to use this opportunity to thank the chairman of INEC and his team for this opportunity given to me and my university to partake in this Anambra 2021. I thank the service chiefs, the people of Anambra State. We remain very grateful.\n\n\u201cAllow me to read this form EC8E, which I have completed. I Prof Florence Banku Obi, hereby certify that I\u2019m the returning officer of the Anambra governorship election held on 6 and 9 of November.\n\n\u201cThat Charles Chukwuma Soludo of APGA, having satisfied the requirement of the law, is hereby declared the winner of the election,\u201d Prof. Obi said,\u201d Obi said.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Soludo, charged his competitors to accept the verdict of the Anambra people, promised never to disappoint his people.\n\n\u201cTo my fellow candidates in the election, I wish to congratulate you for the gallant contest. Our people have spoken overwhelmingly and surely, that voice is the voice of God. The ultimate winner is the Anambra people.\n\n\u201cWe are all winners. I hereby extend my hands of fellowship to all of you. I need all of you to succeed. Politics aside, we are all brothers. Let\u2019s come together for the Anambra project. There is enough room for everyone to contribute for the service of our land. I will need the guidance and contributions of everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cWith utmost humility and gratitude to God, I accept the result of the 2021 Anambra Governorship election as declared by INEC. This reflects the supreme will of the almighty God and an overwhelming sacred mandate of the people. For 12 years since the massive clamour by the people of Anambra for us to serve them, we persevered till this divine moment.\n\n\u201cThis is a divine journey, whose time has come. To God be all the Glory and adoration. We have a very long list of persons, who God used to make this divine moment a reality.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we thank all APGA members, especially, our national leader, Willie Obiano and his wife; our national chairman, Chief Victor Oye and his wife; members of our Board of Trustees; members of our National Executive Council, state exco, etc, for availing me the opportunity to fly the APGA flag.\n\n\u201cMany thanks to our legal team and all other stakeholders that worked tirelessly to see us through. We are grateful to the clergies, the churches, traditional rulers, labour, youths and non-indigene associations, businessmen, persons with disabilities, those in the diaspora and all our donors.\n\n\u201cWe are humbled by the massive support from stakeholders across the entire country. In particular, I thank my wife and children for their love and sacrifices. As I promised, I will work hard every day never to disappoint you.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, we must remember and will continue to remember all those who died in the course of this movement, especially, the three policemen, who were killed by unknown gunmen during our town hall meeting with youths in my ward. May God continue to grant their soul eternal rest.\n\n\u201cThis election tested the resilience and integrity of our federal institutions. Many times, there were tensions, especially as one party boasted that it must \u2018take or conquer.\u2019 This has proven that this country can achieve anything. The judiciary stood for the integrity of that institution and we salute them for standing up for justice.\n\n\u201cWe thank President Buhari and our security agencies for ensuring a level-playing field. We must particularly, commend the Chairman, management of INEC for systematically striving to bequeath a legacy of free, fair and transparent electoral system to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former chairman of APGA, Senator Victor Umeh, while reacting to the victory, said the election was transparent, and is the best election so far held in the state.\n\n\u201cWe have again won the state, despite the fact that some people boasted that they will win the state. This is to tell them that APGA is on ground, and it is not just about boasting of winning, but doing your homework well. I urge them to concede victory to our party and the candidate, because the people made a clear choice.\u201d\n\nThe Anambra governorship election was on Sunday declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) after voting could not hold in Ihiala, a local government area of the state, with some 148,000 registered voters, following alleged violence.\n\nThis, however, was after Soludo, had surpassed the constitutional threshold and was on the cusp of victory, having cleared 18 out of the 21 local government areas in the state.\n\nBut, with 18 local governments in the bag for APGA and Soludo; Nnewi North for Ifeanyi Ubah and YPP, and Ogbaru for Valentine Ozigbo and PDP, Soludo had only led Ozigbo, who turned out his closest challenger, with about 45,000 votes, when Ihiala alone had over 148,000 registered voters.\n\nThe collation officer for Ihiala had, however, alleged that the election was marred by violence, a development he claimed made voting to be impossible, before it was moved to yesterday.\n\nYet, with 18 local governments to APGA\u2019s credit, Soludo not only crossed the threshold, he also led convincingly, making his win incontrovertible.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the results, local government by local government, capturing the four major parties of APC, APGA, PDP and YPP.\n\nIn Dunukofia LGA: APC, 1991; APGA, 4124; PDP, 1680 and YPP 1360.

In Anambra West LGA: APC, 1233; APGA, 1918; PDP, 1401 and YPP, 357.\n\nMeanwhile, the last leg of voting in the governorship election, held amid mixed occurrences.\n\nThe election had been suspended in Ihiala by the Independent National Electoral Commission ((INEC) on Saturday, when the rest of the state went to the poll. This followed reports of irregularities, which caused INEC to declare the Anambra State governorship election inconclusive, and postpone voting in the local government area, with 323 Polling Units, to today.\n\nThe election process was, however, threatened, when gunmen suspected to be operatives of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), said to be the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), engaged the joint security operatives in a gun battle in Ihiala. It was gathered that the gunmen sought to enter Ihiala through Imo State, as Mbosi and Orsumoghu, where the attack happened, were border towns with communities in Imo State.\n\nIPOB Attempt to Scuttle the Vote in Ihiala\n\nA THISDAY reporter, who covered the supplementary governorship election in Ihiala, was prevented from entering the area by security operatives, who turned back journalists at Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction for their safety. After a brief search, they asked the journalists to return, on the insistence that a gun battle was on, ahead.\n\nThe joint security operatives comprised mobile policemen, Army and Navy personnel, and others security agencies. Two unidentified policemen and a soldier, told the THISDAY reporter, \u201cYou have to go back for your own good. For three hours now, we have been exchanging fire with your IPOB brothers. Our men are in the bush now, and it will be risky for you to take this route.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Echeng Eworo, could not confirm the development, but merely asked the reporter to call him back later.\n\nTHISDAY also noticed a team of security men loaded into 10 Toyota Hilux vans, heading to Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction as reinforcement.\n\nThe police in Anambra State have denied knowledge of the killing of anybody during the supplementary election in Ihiala. This was after claims on the social media that soldiers guarding the distribution/Collation Centre shot dead a yet-to-be-identified man.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the local government headquarters, those interviewed denied knowledge of the incident. Even when contacted by telephone, the Zone 13 Police Headquarters Public Relations Officer, Nkeiru Nwode, said there was nothing like that before the police.\n\nNwode said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have such report and I don\u2019t think something like that happened.\u201d\n\nBut the voting process was largely peaceful, as in the main election.\n\nThe candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Obinna Uzor, a lawyer, voted in Umunnamehi Primary School, Ihiala Ward One. Uzor said the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, (BVAS) in the area was slow, and that caused a lot of delay.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is only VIPs that when they cannot be captured, they continue to wait to ensure that they eventually get captured and vote. But the locals among us, once they cannot be captured, they just leave. We love technology, but INEC should fine-tune it. This can affect the outcome of the process.\u201d\n\nIn Ihiala town, INEC officials depended on facials to accredit voters, using the BVAS.\n\nAn INEC official, who spoke to journalists in Eziani Primary school, Ihiala ward one, polling unit 10, on condition of anonymity, said, \u201cThe thumbprint is not functioning, but the facial verification is what we are using to issue out accreditation.\u201d\n\nThe INEC technical officer, however, said it took between 30 seconds and one minute to accredit one voter, and the process progressed speedily.\n\nDeputy Speaker of Anambra State House of Assembly, Hon Pascal Agbodike. Agbodike commended the functioning of the BVAS machine for its swiftness in accrediting voters.\n\nAgbodike, who spoke to journalists after voting at Mbosi Girls Secondary School, said the BVAS machine functioned very smoothly.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have voted, and I have also observed voting in my ward, Mbosi ward 20, and I can say that the working of the BVAS is perfect for now. Things are going well and the BVAS is working, from what I can attest for now.\n\n\u201cAnambra people are largely peaceful people, and you can see that everything is going on well. Whether election or not, our people are their brothers\u2019 keepers. Whatever you may have experienced is just because of politics. After the election, we will all go back to being brothers as we have always been.\u201d\n\nA visit to Mbosi community, ward 20, showed that voting started early.\n\nA technical officer with INEC, who preferred anonymity, said the voting went on well.\n\nThe officer said, \u201cWe started voting about 12pm, and there is satisfactory level of turnout. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machine is working perfectly today. We updated our software and today, it is not taking up to one minute to accredit one voter.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, security operatives also barred Umeh, from entering Ihiala, during the election.\n\nThere had been restriction of movement in and out of Ihiala, with stern looking military operatives manning the boarders of the community.\n\nUmeh, who hails from Aguluzoigbo in Anaocha Local Government Area, was said to have entered Ihiala, but when he attempted to enter the local government secretariat, where materials for the election were being distributed, security operatives barred him.\n\nUmeh, a state agent of the party, who arrived Ihiala secretariat around 10:30am in company with other party members, was turned back by the GOC, 82 Division, who said he was at the secretariat to ensure things went well.\n\nAccording to the GOC, the former lawmaker had no business being at the secretariat as he was a state agent.\n\n\u201cYou are not supposed to be here. You are a state agent, not LGA agent,\u201d the senior military officer stated.\n\nINEC had notified all stakeholders in the election that collation of results would resume at 9pm at the State Collation Centre, INEC State Office, along the House of Assembly Road, Awka.\n\nIn another breath, the immediate past convener of the Civil Society coalition, Situation Room and the Executive Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo, has urged INEC to do a review of the processes leading to the deployment of BVAS.\n\nNwankwo said the commission should consider a review of its strategies for movement of sensitive materials for election, adding that the current logistics arrangement is very disappointing.\n\nSpeaking on the ARISE Television News Channel, Morning Show, programme, Nwankwo said the introduction of BVAS was an innovative effort, which was in line with the desire of Nigerians to enthrone a transparent electoral process.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the experience wasn\u2019t nice and going forward, the shortcomings will serve a useful lesson to see what needs to be done to improve on the use of electronic means in the conduct of elections.\u201d\n\nNwankwo spoke of the security situation in Anambra State, adding that contrary to widespread fears over a possible outbreak of violence and serious breach of peace during the election, such incidents were minimal. He said it was necessary for the security agencies to review their strategy of heavy deployment of security forces in the South-east.\n\nThe Situation Room said it observed late commencement of voting in the rescheduled election.\n\nA statement issued by the Convener of the Situation Room, Mrs. Ene Obi, on Tuesday, said voting was yet to commence as at noon, and a few voters were seen arriving and leaving the polling units ahead of the arrival of the INEC ad hoc staff.\n\nObi said, \u201cReports received from Ihiala LGA indicate late deployment of materials and INEC staff from the LGA office. At 10am, which was the scheduled start time, there was no sign of INEC staff and voting materials at any of the polling units.\n\n\u201cSituation Room notes that voting is starting more than two hours late on the average due to late deployment of voting materials and INEC ad hoc staff. INEC will need to extend the time beyond 4pm to ensure all the voters, who have come out to vote actually cast their votes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Is it the legislature or the executive? I think the party remains with the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe, as governors, I don\u2019t think anybody is afraid of direct primary. No governor, I can tell you \u2014 not APC, not PDP, not APGA; at least these are the parties that we have today.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that I will always caution that whenever we are making laws or taking decisions, we should not base it on the impulse of the moment.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying anybody is afraid of direct primary. The drafters of the party constitution, especially at it affects APC, envisaged that there could be a situation where one particular mode of primary may not be feasible, then you adopt another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe drafters envisaged that there are issues like that where there will be options. If you now come up with a legislation and you say it must be one, what happens if a situation arises and congresses cannot be held or primary can\u2019t be held? And you are saying INEC must observe. What happens if such can\u2019t happen? It means there is no primary.\n\n\u201cLet there be options, because if we box ourselves into a corner because of certain perceptions and try to set the people against the party or against the government, we may be consumed at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI, governor Yahaya Bello, am not afraid of direct primary. In fact, if anything I will even prefer it. I\u2019m confident of my popularity and whoever is popular should go and test popularity at the polls.\n\n\u201cWhether APC governor, PDP governor, any governor at all that is afraid of direct primary means he is not popular and I can assure you no governor is not popular in his state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, I\u2019m telling you of the implication \u2014 let the general public not be set against the governors or against the government.

          "title": "How to secure funding for your early-stage startup in Africa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of action thrillers, you\u2019ve probably seen security operatives working with hi-tech gadgets like smart glasses and smartwatches (looking at you, James Bond). In case you\u2019re wondering if those are real or if they\u2019ll ever be commonplace in Africa, we are taking a closer look at a Nigerian-founded company building hi-tech gadgets but with a twist.\n\nA conversation about Nigeria\u2019s security challenges could fill an encyclopedia. Besides the numerous lives lost, they have also had a significant economic impact, costing the country billions of dollars.\n\nThe Institute for Economics and Peace \u2018Global Peace Index 2021: Measuring Peace in a Complex World, Sydney, June 2021 report reveals that Nigeria lost $40 billion in 2020 to insecurity \u2014 Unknown gunmen, robberies and theft, and others.\n\nMoreso, in 2020, it lost about $12 million to electronic fraud in nine months. If Deloitte West Africa\u2019s report is to be believed, then the country has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in ten years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a textile businessman who received frequent supplies from Northern Nigeria, these were more than just statistics for him.\n\nIt was a typical day in 2015, and he had just received a familiar call stating that another unforeseen circumstance had disrupted his supply yet again, and he was fed up.\n\nI sent items regularly from Lagos to Kano, and I kept hearing that the containers went missing, vanished. Where are the goods? Where\u2019s the driver?\u201d\n\nWith no answers forthcoming, he installed tracking devices, which didn\u2019t do much because the perpetrators always disarmed them.\n\nThen came the light bulb moment. Monsuru Anifowoshe figured he could build a drone to monitor his trucks.\n\n\u201cTo me, it seemed like the perfect thing to build while also rendering service to other people who were, say, producers or importers who had customers around Nigeria. So I built a UAV or UAS system to monitor my goods to ensure they went to the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nSide note: UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and UAS stands for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru Anifowoshe, CEO of Kifta Technologies\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the startup space, you may have noticed how startup or company founders sometimes start a business because of a problem they had which no one was fixing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonsuru, however, maintains that his reasons were purely selfish. It was when they started building that they talked to other people in the market and realised that there was an opportunity to do something for others too.\n\nHowever, having always run a business, Monsuru, a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Lagos, had no idea how to design UAVs or UAS systems. He had to acquire some knowledge and skills about UAVs to communicate with design companies effectively, specifically, industrial design companies.\n\n\u201cSo it made it easier to talk to professional design companies, and whenever they brought designs, I could say no it can not be like this; it should be like that,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nIn 2017, he brought in Mcdonald Ukah, an economist with solid business acumen, as a co-founder to help with the company\u2019s business development efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcdonald Ukah, co-founder of Kifta Technologies\n\nWe\u2019ve delved deep into the difficulties of building a hardware business in Nigeria, and the co-founders experienced this first hand when developing prototypes for Kifta\u2019s different products. The usual suspects like unreliable power and lack of local talent were major bottlenecks the company faced.\n\nDespite the challenges, they built a proper team of experts from different continents. Not minding the cost and the time zone issues, he explains that he didn\u2019t have time for trial and error, and he just wanted to get the best people who had done something similar and build a working prototype.\n\nThe UAV prototype cost $450k, and it took three years to complete.\n\nSidenote: The average seed round for software startups in Africa as of 2021 is $1.5 million. Almost a third of that was spent on building one prototype for a hardware startup.\n\nFollowing the success of the UAV prototype, Kifta Technologies was born, and the company now boasts different UAS systems, including firefighting UAS, Naval UAS, Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), and the regular UAS that is not deployed over a body of water.\n\nAll these products have unique and mouth-watering features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA USV designed by Kifta Technologies\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one of the UAVs, which can travel for nine hours, uses a wireless link where the device communicates with other devices through radio waves.\n\n\u201cIt can go from Lagos to South Africa, charge for a bit, and make it back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBesides UAS, the company currently has a diverse range of hardware and software products. There are devices for the police, military, churches, schools, and identification systems.\n\nMonsuru, however, admits that those for churches and schools are less sophisticated than the others.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of software that we use for pipeline security, power cable security, and border security. Some of them are like the DAS system, the DTS system, and the SCADA system. Most of these things are powered by specific hardware which we use for their operations,\u201d he says.\n\nOf all the equipment, we got to see what the police and identification glasses look like and the possible use cases. Forgive my colleagues for encouraging Monsuru to place me in his facial recognition database as a wanted person. You can watch the video below.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru and Emmanuel Paul, our Senior Reporter, test running the Smart glasses\n\nKifta\u2019s business model is simple: sell these hardware and software products to clients. The company currently has clients from different countries, but it has very minimal operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe might sell to an entity in Nigeria that wants to use it for their operations, and they will have to talk to the regulators by themselves. It is not yet fully operational commercially,\u201d he reveals.\n\nKifta mainly runs a B2B model focusing on African businesses. Interestingly, it gets lots of clients from outside the continent. It also licenses some of its proprietary technology, like the pipeline security software, to companies who want to use them.\n\nThe company\u2019s smart glasses, which can see up to 20 kilometres and has a facial and licence plate recognition system, is also gaining traction with security agencies in Africa. There are also industry and educational use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, sometimes you develop a project and then stumble on another use case. In the manufacturing industry, we have a function that can record a step by step process on how to assemble this (smart glasses). It can record it for any newbie. The person wears this, and it lectures them. You open the motherboard; you screw it this way.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you sign a six-month or one-year deal with an expatriate. After that one year, you\u2019re certain that the ex-pat has transferred whatever knowledge into your system, and the AI in the glasses transmits it in a step by step process. The glasses teach whatever knowledge that ex-pat has transmitted or shared.\u201d\n\nThe company leverages its expertise in AI and AR to develop IoT devices for different industries. It currently has a partnership with a Rwandan company to develop IoT for farms. A method that promises to be a big boost for the country\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nOther African countries also use its products, but he didn\u2019t mention which for security reasons. Trust us, we asked.\n\nDespite having several exciting products that could be relevant to the Nigerian situation, we found it quite telling that Kifta Technologies does not have much traction in Nigeria compared to other African countries.\n\nIts smart glasses, for example, could be relevant to Nigerian law enforcement agencies. Features like the recognition software, location search, and live transmission would help them fulfil their duties while keeping them accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smart glasses can be connected to a database of people in a company, state, or country.\n\nThe glasses could be connected to the National Identity Number (NIN) database if needed. So why has adoption stalled in Nigeria? Monsuru maintains that it\u2019s a problem of accessing the right people.\n\n\u201cIf you want to install security cameras in our airports or along our borders, it\u2019s not as easy as waltzing into the customs office and saying I want to see the DG. And it\u2019s not as easy as sending them a cold email as you would send to a private company. For a government agency, it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThere have been situations where I tried to visit some of these places, and the security sent me away at the gate. Their favourite excuse is I can\u2019t come in without an appointment. How do I get an appointment when the contact phone number doesn\u2019t even work, and I didn\u2019t get a reply to my email?\u201d he asks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power issues also ensure that Kifta limits its production. The production process of those products requires very steady power, and we learnt that even a 1 \u2013 2% voltage increase could damage the whole prototype if it\u2019s not configured correctly.\n\n\u201cAs much as it\u2019s beautiful to have all of these, adopting them in Nigeria is quite difficult, which is why most of our business and customers are not in Nigeria,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nHe believes that since the high-tech defence industry is still young, most regulators are unaware that Nigerians are doing such innovations. He recommends that processes to reach relevant people should be put in place.\n\nSo far, the company has been bootstrapping and has never raised any institutional funding. It is, however, planning to raise funds to support some of its exciting plans.\n\nCommercialising defence technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one reason Kifta is trying to raise now is to expand its offerings to serve a broader market.\n\nFor him, since every facet of the hi-tech industry is quite niche, the company is working on expanding its offerings by implementing a drones-as-a-service platform in collaboration with logistics companies. Maybe not for small packages, but decent-sized parcels.\n\nIn the long run, we\u2019re also looking to scale up our UAS systems into building an air cargo system able to take a 3-ton payload that can move for five hours at a stretch,\u201d he reveals.\n\nMonsuru believes that the UAS system could significantly impact logistics in Nigeria. It would be fitted with storage systems and help many farmers get goods to the market in record time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing, where you offer the logistics and help the farmers to become part of the global trade. By cutting off the middlemen completely, who, I must say, are responsible for the hike in food prices.\n\n\u201cImagine a basket of tomatoes in Maiduguri is \u20a6500, but when it gets to Lagos, it\u2019s already \u20a65,500. The middlemen will tell you that they incur all the risks, which was the same issue I had. So imagine you can build something where the producers can connect directly to the buyer.\n\n\u201cThey (the producers) now have the opportunity to sell a bit higher. So a farmer that sells for \u20a6500 can sell for \u20a61500.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also points out that building a cargo UAV to ensure speedy transfer of goods would have significant ripple effects on the economy and, of course, the environment.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be autonomous. It will be designed for that purpose, so it takes away a lot of associated costs because it\u2019s designed for that purpose against normal cargo planes that weren\u2019t designed for that purpose. And because a portion of it is electric, it\u2019s going to reduce emissions, following all those wonderful things we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nEffective logistics has been a considerable challenge for both traditional and electronic commerce in Nigeria. The entire industry has struggled, and every facet of the problems they face runs deep.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s well-documented challenges, the company plans to introduce a manufacturing plant in Nigeria. Though every element might not be made here, it intends to produce enough for the products to qualify as Nigerian-made.\n\nThere are interesting times ahead for Kifta, and if its defence technologies are transferred to a sector like commerce, it could be potentially game-changing. For now, Monsuru encourages the government to improve support for innovative hardware developers.\n\nHe also wants to see more talented people delve into the hardware industry. He argues that while software engineering has gone mainstream, other types of talent like firmware engineers and propulsion and control systems engineers are hard to come by.\n\n\u201cThere might be some, but have they coded into a hardware product? Because a propulsion system can be used in a manufacturing plant or a petrochemical plant, or wherever. But I\u2019m talking in terms of UAVs, smart glasses, how they move from one phase to another, How one part kicks off and what part goes back.\u201d\n\nAre you a talented person out there, and this seems like it\u2019s describing you? Kifta is hiring for as many as nine positions, and the company is actively looking for people like you.\n\n\u201cThey can always go to the website kiftatechnologies.com. And we might even increase that depending on what we decide internally on the industries we\u2019re looking to expand to. Please, I\u2019m looking for wonderful talent, and we pay considerably well. Maths people, physics people, come,\u201d he declares.\n\nSo what do you think? Let\u2019s hear your thoughts in the comments below.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most startup founders looking to raise money, the obvious choice is equity financing. However, there is another option \u2013 debt financing. Equity financing requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital.\n\nDebt financing allows founders to raise money by selling debt instruments to individuals or investors, and this money is then paid back at an agreed-upon date with interest.\n\nSo far, few African startups have raised money this way, with fintech startups Carbon, FairMoney, and mobility startup, MAX.ng some examples. During the week, we had a chat with Hani Ibrahim, the Chief Investment Officer of Lendable, a UK-based debt financing company, to learn how the company invests.\n\nAfter studying and working in the UK across various corporate finance and investment banking roles, Ibrahim moved to the Middle East. He spent five years working in Dubai and Qatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there, he set up investment banking platforms for local banks and institutions in both countries. In addition, he also worked at QInvest, where he ran a $500 million credit strategy, investing across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2019, he moved to the UK and soon took up his current position at Lendable. Founded by Dyland Friend and Daniel Goldman, the firm provides credit facilities for non-bank lenders in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nInitially a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, Lendable provided an analytics platform to analyse loans. Soon after, they added an investment arm and have provided over $100 million to startups across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHani Ibrahim. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Lendable focuses on startups providing credit facilities in frontier or emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe investment thesis is that we target emerging markets, particularly Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But we do look at the wider emerging markets with a focus on the FinTech space. We also target businesses that promote and provide products to those that have found or typically find it difficult to access financial services.\u201d\n\nA key thing to note is that Lendable does not invest in companies at the idea stage. Instead, they invest in startups with a proven product but need capital to get to the next level. The firm provides these startups with money that is repaid over some time.\n\nOn average, these companies receive debt financing between five and ten million dollars.\n\nFintech startups are not the only ones who receive funding from Lendable. Ibrahim reveals that any tech-driven startup providing a financing option fits their investment criteria. However, companies in sectors that they believe have harmful, or no impact on their markets are excluded from their target market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really interested in is supporting micro and small businesses across the African continent,\u201d he says.\n\nThings startups should avoid\n\nIbrahim pointed out that while startups are usually focused on rolling out new products and hiring new staff, they must watch their finances, precisely how and where they are getting their capital.\n\n\u201cOne thing that they should make sure that they spend time over is to think about their financing. How are they actually getting their capital? Where are they getting their capital from, and in what format?\n\n\u201cDo they have the right mix of capital? Are they thinking about the risks of the different types of capital and the costs and drawbacks and the different types of capital\u201d\n\nBiggest success stories\n\nHaving provided financing for several companies, Ibrahim is particularly proud of Watu Credit, a boda boda financing startup. In the five years since their launch in Kenya, the company has expanded its reach into Uganda and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey were a smaller business, and we supported them with a small facility at the time. They are at least in Kenya, but most probably in East Africa, seen as the market leader for leasing motorcycle taxis in their space.\n\n\u201cTo reach a market leadership position in five years is an incredible achievement for their team. But we\u2019re also very proud to have played our part in supporting that.\u201d\n\nOn missed opportunities and regrets\n\nWith fintech the darling of investors across the world, Lendable sees a lot of pitches from startups, so I asked Ibrahim about missed opportunities and possible regrets. \u201cI think there are certainly opportunities that we\u2019ve missed. Because there is so much going on in the space, we can\u2019t do everything.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is that I would love to do more across different markets in Africa. You know, each market has its own specific ways of doing a transaction. So we\u2019re working through each market, and I\u2019m filtering through them to see where we can do transactions.\u201d\n\nIbrahim discloses that when investments have not gone according to plan, they work with the management team to find solutions. He says that both parties work together to develop a solution that is a win for both parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Rev. Patrick Ebosele Ekpu on his 50th Episcopal anniversary and 90th birthday celebration, saluting his contributions to the development of Edo State and Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the celebration, held at St. Paul Catholic Church, Airport Road, Benin City, the governor said the clergy\u2019s service in God\u2019s vineyard has drawn more Christians to God.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur father has lived a very illustrious life and a life of service. His service in the vineyard of God has provided the opportunity for many Christian faithful to sustain personal connection and relationship with God.\u201d\n\nObaseki said Ekpu and other Nigerian patriots, in the midst of the civil war, were called into the service of God and accelerated to become Bishops in the Catholic Church, adding, \u201c50 years on, they have changed the face of the church in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe role of the Catholic Church became significant and very prominent particularly after the civil war, because of the diligent work our father commenced as a Bishop of this Diocese. As a priest, he has risen to the pinnacle of his Episcopal calling and has seen it all. We will continue to cherish his wisdom and experience.\n\n\u201cIn his service to the work of God, he brought the Church closer to the people and created an awareness where the people, regarded as fetish, got to understand Christianity better and became closer to God.\u201d\n\nNoting that the clergy has made huge contributions to the development of society, the governor noted, \u201cAt the age of 90 years, he continues to provide leadership even in retirement. We will continue to tap from his rich pool of wisdom to guide us as we chart our path through these very difficult times.\u201d\n\nWelcoming guests, the Archbishop of Benin and President, Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), Most Rev.

          "title": "Paris Club Refund Debt: Governors can\u2019t back out anymore \u2013 AGF",
          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, says there is no going back on the federal government\u2019s decision to commence deducting $418million from the 36 states\u2019 accounts to settle their indebtedness to consultants and private firms concerning the Paris and London clubs refund.\n\nThis is despite the governors\u2019 opposition to it and the recent order issued by the Federal High Court in Abuja stopping the deduction of the money from the accounts of the 36 states to settle the judgment debts.\n\nThe debts had accrued from court judgments awarding the creditors, who claimed to be \u201cconsultants\u201d and \u201ccontractors\u201d to the states and local governments, various sums of money which currently stand at $418 million.\n\nSome of the creditors claimed to have earned their shares of the money through \u2018consultancy services\u2019 of helping state and local governments to recover funds over-deducted by the federal government from their allocations between 1995 and 2002 to service the London Club and Paris Club loans.\n\nThe contractors among the creditors claimed to have executed projects for the the various local government areas of the country. The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) has denied the execution of the projects.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported how President Muhammadu Buhari had ignored the protests by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) to approve the issuance of promissory notes to the creditors.\n\nThe promissory notes asked to be issued by the Debt Management Office (DMO) are to be funded through deductions from the allocations of the states and local governments for a period of 10 years.\n\nMr Malami said it was too late in the day for the governors, through the NGF to backtrack on the indebtness they had earlier commitment to pay.\n\nAddressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, Mr Malami pointed out that the NGF and the ALGON as well as the consultants entered into a consent judgment of $3,188, 079,505,.56 ($3.2billion) in 2013, which they made commitment to pay and indeed, made part payments between 2016 and 2017.\n\nOn whether the FG\u2019s insistence on the deduction would not amount to disrespecting an existing court orders and circumventing pending court cases, Mr Malami wondered why the state governments went to bed since 2013, made part payment and only decided on court cases now.\n\nThe NGF had in a statement on Monday accused the AGF of betraying public interest by supporting private interests in his handling of the Paris Club fund debt.\n\nThe governors said Mr Malami was being biased in his handling of the issue and wondered why he was in a haste in paying the consultants when the states were in need of funds.\n\nBackground\n\nGiving a historical perspective to the dispute, the AGF said \u201cSometime as far back as 2013, there was an engagement by the outgoing administration and the NGF in respect of certain consultants that were engaged by the two (NGF and ALGON) for the purpose of recovering certain amounts of money relating to Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cAnd these consultants that were engaged have indeed delivered and fundamentally, they were not paid the fees for the services they claimed to have rendered and on account of which they approached the judicial system for the determination of their rights and indeed the enforcement of their fees,\u201d Mr Malami explained.\n\n\u201cNow, in 2013 parties, the then Federal Government and the governors\u2019 forum came together, agreed and submitted to a consent judgment by the court of law in 2013. That consent judgment is what gave rise to the liability in contention as we are talking today.\n\n\u201cSome years back, the Federal Government was approached by these consultants for the purpose of payment of their respective professional fees. The Federal Government then approached the governors forum and ALGON and the collectively walked to the Federal Government and conceded to the position that the consultants have indeed provided the services and that they were ready and willing for the payment.\n\n\u201cThe point of interest arising therefrom is that the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON, walked to the federal government and conceding that payment should be deducted from their monies and then should be effected to the consultants.\n\n\u201cAnd then, in 2016, 2017, these deductions were carried out at the instance of the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON. Now that was the situation on the ground,\u201d Malami said.\n\nHe stated that because the federal government was suspicious of the huge claim the NGF and ALGON made on behalf of the consultants, which was in the region of $3.2billion the FG had to invite the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the State Security Services (SSS) to verify the verify the services rendered by the said consultants.\n\n\u201cSo, when eventually the services rendered were confirmed, out of further abundance of caution, the Federal Government took steps to demand for confirmation in writing from ALGON and the governors.\n\n\u201cThe governors individually wrote to the effect that they were liable. ALGON wrote to the effect that they were liable. And eventually this payment commenced as far back as 2016.\n\n\u201cNow, nothing untoward happened thereafter until perhaps of recent when the governors wrote seeking to avoid their liability.\n\n\u201cThe implication of that, taking into consideration that the Federal Government was indeed sued as a party was that at the end of the day the liability will be placed exclusively at the door steps of the Federal Government, where in actual fact, this is a liability that was incurred by the governors\u2019 forum; this was a liability admitted by the governors\u2019 forum.\n\n\u201cThis is a case in respect of which the governors\u2019 forum and ALGON conceded to judgment by way of submitting to a consent judgment before a court of law.\n\n\u201cSo what I am labouring to say in effect is that one, the engagement that gave rise to this liability was an engagement that was factored by ALGON and the governors\u2019 forum.\n\n\u201cTwo, arising from such liability, by way of creating a contractual obligation, parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the court in the form of the case instituted by consultants against the governors\u2019 forum and against ALGON, and the parties submitted to consent judgment.\n\n\u201cThree, the governors have indeed each provided a letter of commitment to the Federal Government that they were indeed liable, the same thing with ALGON.\n\n\u201cThey wrote individually; the governors wrote, individually directing the federal government to effect payment of this amount. And we have the letters at our disposal, perhaps copies could be made available to you after this session.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are saying in essence, is that this is a self-induced problem arising from concession, arising from the consent, arising from agreement of the governors\u2019 forum and arising from agreement of ALGON\n\n\u201cAnd then four, over and above all these, payment has indeed been effected over time without any objection on the part of ALGON and the governors\u2019 forum over time.\n\n\u201cSo it is indeed amazing that the governors are now belatedly, after having serviced the same claim for over a period of four five years, are now belatedly turning round to raise objections in respect of the payment,\u201d the AGF argued.",

          "title": "SEC Urges Corporates to Leverage on Islamic Capital Market",
          "text": "As part of its developmental role, the Securities and Exchange Commission has assured that it will continue to encourage corporates to leverage on the Islamic Capital Market by providing and ensuring an attractive enabling environment.\n\nDirector General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda stated this at the 2021 African International Conference on Islamic Finance held in Abuja Wednesday with the theme \u201cInfrastructure Financing, Sustainability, and the Future of African Markets 2.0\u201d\n\nYuguda represented by the Executive Commissioner Corporate Services SEC, Mr. Ibrahim Boyi said the Commission is working assiduously with relevant stakeholders to implement recommendations for the Non-Interest Capital Market sector in line with the objectives of the 10-year Nigerian Capital Market Masterplan (2015-2025) which include developing the segment of the market to contribute at least 25% of the overall capital market capitalization by 2025, with Sukuk contributing 15% of outstanding bond issuances.\n\nBoyi said Islamic finance instruments are globally recognized as acceptable securities, with less Value-at-Risk due to their asset-based and project-tied investment features. Thus, it offers financial products that are safe, competitive and attractive. Many jurisdictions have realized the potentials in Islamic Finance and have positioned themselves to tap the potential benefit of such financing.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is noteworthy that since Islamic finance heavily relies on the Islamic Capital Market (ICM) as an investable outlet, products such as Sukuk (Islamic Bond), Islamic REITs (I-REITS), Islamic Funds (I-Funds) and Exchange-mirrored Traded Funds (Islamic Equity Index) could all be offered for the purpose of financing infrastructure.\n\n\u201cSukuk issuances are increasingly gaining significance as a veritable mode of infrastructure financing. Consequently, a number of countries in the Sub-Saharan region of the continent \u2013 Sudan, Gambia, Senegal, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Mali, and Togo- have issued sovereign Sukuks to finance infrastructure.\n\nBoyi said in Nigeria, the SEC has implemented a number of reforms aimed at deepening the non-interest capital market.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have reviewed existing regulatory frameworks and introduced new ones. In particular, we issued rules on Islamic Fund Management as well as on Sukuk issuance. These two legal frameworks have encouraged Islamic product innovation with the registration of ten ethical/shariah compliant funds and the issuance of Nigeria\u2019s sub-national Ijara Sukuk by the Osun State government in 2013, which was oversubscribed.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Federal Government, through the Debt Management Office (DMO) has so far issued Ijara Sukuk in excess of N350 Billion within the last 3 years. The funds were used to construct and rehabilitate infrastructure development projects across the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe SEC Executive Commissioner said the Commission of recent also approved a N30 billion corporate Sukuk Programme and a N10 billion series issuance under the Programme. This marks the first corporate Sukuk issuance to the public; commendably, the proceeds are to be used to finance housing infrastructure. Similar to the sovereign issuances, the corporate issuance was also oversubscribed. The issuance was a landmark in the Market and we are confident that more corporates will begin to access the market.\n\nHe said the theme of this year\u2019s conference resonates with a core function of the capital market as the market plays a crucial role in enabling access to medium and long term financing which is better suited to infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cAccording to the AfDB, Africa requires an annual investment of between $130 to $170 billion annually in infrastructure to reduce its infrastructure deficit. While according to the Global Infrastructure Hub (2020), Africa required infrastructure investment of US$184.03 billion in 2019 and US$190.1 billion in 2020 to close its infrastructure de\ufb01cits.\n\n\u201cThe African continent continues to be challenged by de\ufb01cits in infrastructure with governments being the major \ufb01nancier of infrastructure. Regrettably, governments\u2019 efforts to \ufb01nance the sector is constrained by large de\ufb01cits in budget, rising public debt and debt sustainability concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nBoyi disclosed that the Commission is also considering modalities to constitute a Sharia Advisory Council as a body of experts to advise the SEC and the market on non-interest products and their applications.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, our focus will be on public enlightenment to encourage sub-national and corporate issuances and stronger capacity building initiatives. This is what informed the idea of hosting 3 webinars on non-interest capital market products in 2021 and more will be organized next year.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the State governments represented here will take advantage of this important opportunity to familiarize themselves with the kind of products that can be issued and how to leverage this exciting area of finance to better the lives of our citizens.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated the SEC\u2019s commitment to continue to Identify ways of using Non-Interest capital market products such as Sukuk as a tool for financing infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to facilitating the growth of the non interest Capital market segment through innovation whilst ensuring a fair, efficient and transparent market.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to put in place clear and consistently applied regulatory frameworks and reduce regulatory and operational impediments to engender the smooth functioning of the market\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Okafor Ofiebor/ Port Harcourt\n\nOgoni Youth Federation, OYF, an umbrella body of Ogoni youth groups, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to declare November 10th a public holiday in Nigeria in honour of murdered Ogoni 9 led by writer and environmental activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa Wiwa.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by Engr. Yamaabana Legborsi, its President noted that Ken Saro-Wiwa and his compatriots otherwise known as \u2018Ogoni 9\u2019, were executed by the Sani Abacha led Nigerian Military Government on 10th November, 1995, despite local and international outcries that they were unjustly tried in a military tribunal.\n\nOYF therefore asked President Buhari to exonerate the names of the Ogoni 9 from the trumped-up allegations of the Justice Ibrahim Auta led kangroo tribunal and bestow posthumous national honours on them.\n\nBut the group said it does not subscribe to the type of pardon that was done in the case of the late Moshood Abiola.\n\n\u201cPardon is granted to criminals and Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other Ogoni martyrs were not found guilty of any crime as required under our corpus juris and do not deserve a pardon. They were without fair trial extra-judicially killed by a kangaroo military tribunal. Their execution provoked international outrage and resulted in Nigeria\u2019s suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations\u201d.\n\nOYF stated that after their execution, the United Nations, set up a Fact-finding Committee, the committee which arrived Nigeria on April 1996, passed a verdict that the trial and execution of the Ogoni 9 was unjust, unfair, partial in every shred of human consideration and it did not meet the requirements of both domestic and international Human laws.\n\nThe youth group further said the quest for national healing and reconciliation can not complete until the Nigerian Government adhere to their demands on the Ogoni 9.\n\nOgoni Youths posited that the hanging of the Ogoni 9 remains a permanent stain on Nigeria\u2019s claim to civilization.\n\n\u201cAs we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa, our beloved and dogged leader whom the Nigerian government and Shell killed with the hope that his death will pave way for them to take Ogoni oil.\n\n\u201cWe remember the other eight and the first four \u2013 all of whose blood has been a sacrifice for our freedom. OYF will not fail to actualize the collective dream for a free and better Ogoni. Though Ken Saro-Wiwa is no more, he will not rest in peace until human dignity returns to the men, women and children of Ogoniland\u201d.\n\nThe youth group invited all youths, community based youths bodies with their executives and members from Babbe Kingdom, Ken-Khana Kingdom, Nyo-Khana Kingdom, Gokana Kingdom, Tai Kingdom, Eleme Kingdom, Bori Urban Territory and the Ban-Ogoi Special Area to its upcoming Extraordinary Ogoni Youth Summit.",

Therefore, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, its Agencies and partners are mainstreaming climate change adaptation and conducting vulnerability assessment to reduce risks.\n\n\u201cWe, as the majorstakeholders in this race, are compelled to offer risk reduction mechanisms, social protection systems and humanitarian interventions to protect vulnerable persons from the consequence of climate change\u201d.\n\nThe Minister also noted that Nigeria is experiencing more hydro-meteorological events such as flooding, windstorm, drought, coastal and gully erosions amongst others which have led to huge economic losses and unavoidable deaths.\n\n\u201cRainfall patterns have changed and we are seeing more communities in local governments becoming highly probable flood risk areas.\n\nThrough the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA we also carry out climate change adaptation projects that focus on state and communal levels.\n\nWe are also promoting research and education through universities in Nigeria. Some impactful activities are the public sensitization activities as well as the reports gathered by NEMA using DesInventar information management system for monitoring and reporting climate related hazards.\n\n\u201cWe recently completed a risk analysis and vulnerability assessment in Nigeria, in three prevalent categories of hazards: floods, endemics, and conflicts.\n\nThese findings will help us plan and further develop climate change adaption programs in the vulnerable areas identified.\n\n\u201cTo implement this, we are building partnerships and strengthening the capacities of disaster risk management agencies at local and State levels for implementation adaptation.\n\n\u201cI will like to use this opportunity to reiterate Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030y and thank the UNFCCC and the Ministry of Environment for facilitating this platform at COP26,\u201d Umar Farouq concluded.\n\nAt the side event also was Mr. Manuel Marques Pereira, Head of the Migration, Environment and Climate Change of the International Organization for Migration, Senator Hassan Muhammed Gusau, Chairman of the Ecological Committee, Mr Vincent Owan, Director Planning, Research and Forecasting, who represented the DG.

          "text": "On Tuesday, first lady Aisha, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari hinted that Nigeria has a lot more to do in her efforts to end Tuberculosis (TB) in Nigeria.\n\nShe said the emergence COVID-19 pandemic had reminded everyone that the fight against TB can only be won by working with relevant bodies and in isolation, thus she called on stakeholders to work together to end TB by supporting a multi-sectorial approach and effective coordination to eradicate the deadly diseases.\n\nAisha made the call at the 2021 National TB Conference with the theme:\u201d Sustaining a Resilient TB Response In Nigeria: Addressing the Impact of COVID-19 and other Diseases\u201d, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nFirst Lady of Niger State, Dr. Amina Abubakar Bello who re-presented Aisha Buhari at the occasion, said that; \u201cDespite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic , Nigeria can still make progress in case detection and treatment with intensified monitoring and identification of TB cases\n\n\u201cIt is important that we should not lose sight of TB which has been around us much longer and continue to kill people in Nigeria at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201d Since I was appointed Global TB Champion and Ambassador, I have used my position to push TB issues among stakeholders at the National, Regional and Global levels. At this forum in 2018, I promise to cascade this effort by appointing all the wives of governors as state TB champions and it has been a game-changer as it is helping to create more awareness about TB up to the community levels. This effort has increased TB advocacy and mobilisation all over Nigeria and will help to galvanise the much-needed support from the Federal, state, and Local Government levels. \u201c\n\nIn his address, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire said the COVID-19 pandemic brought 2020 global case finding levels back to 2012 level, with an 18% reduction in the number of patients diagnosed with TB dropping from 7.1 million in 2019 to 5.8 million in 2020, thus setting global case finding efforts back by 8 years.\n\n\u201cThe first COVID19 case was diagnosed on 27th February 2020 and measures to control the pandemic were introduced, with eventual lockdown in Quarter 2 (Q2), 2020. Nigeria recorded a 30% reduction in GeneXpert testing in the first week of the lockdown, the number of notified TB cases also dropped by 17% from 33,119 TB cases in Q1, 2020 to 27,353 Q2,2020. This necessitated the conceptualization and implementation of innovative interventions to ensure program sustainability and mitigate the impact on TB control efforts, the implementation of which resulted in an eventual 15% increase across the country, in the number of TB cases notified from 120,266 TB cases in 2019 to 138,591 TB cases in 2020, making us one of the few countries that recorded increased in TB notification in 2020, despite the pandemic. Key among the interventions was a strategic engagement of the private sector, the introduction of targeted, data-driven community TB case finding activities, integration of TB case finding in COVID-19 outreaches, active TB, and integrated TB/COVID-19 case finding activities in health facilities among others. Some of these helpful practices in TB case finding will be shared during this conference, so I urge participants to attend all the sessions.\n\n\u201d 9 months into this year 2021, we have already surpassed the total number of TB cases notified in all of 2020 by about 7%, and for the first time, Nigeria could be notifying up to 200,000 TB cases by the end of 2021. I like to here commend all who are making this happen, including our partners WHO, Global Fund, USAID, and other USG agencies and their partners, KNCV, Stop TB partnership, the TB network, community-based organizations, and health workers who are the foot soldiers, for their hard work in the fight to end TB in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe know that we still have a way to go to reach the targets for ending the TB epidemic and that most of our TB cases are yet undetected. We are not as close as we would like to the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UNHLM) target on TB case finding, TB Preventive Treatment (TPT), and other TB thematic areas set to be achieved by 2022 and the milestones for ending TB in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, the Acting Board Chairman, Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, Dr. Ayodele Awe said COVID-19 has harmed global health including TB services in Nigeria and around the world despite efforts by the partnership to continue to reach out to stakeholders both at community levels for more engagement on case finding.\n\nThis impact has severely disrupted TB responses, stalling and reversing years of progress made against TB. In 2020, COVID-19 overtook TB globally as the most common cause of death from infectious disease, but in low and middle-income countries, TB deaths remain far higher than those from COVID-19.\n\nHe commended the National TB and Leprosy Control Programme and other stakeholders who have worked tirelessly to navigate the impact of TB control efforts in Nigeria. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, Nigeria achieved about a 15% increase in case notification as the number of TB notified cases increased from 117,320 in 2019 to 138,591 in 2020. Also, the overall TB treatment coverage increased from 27% in 2019 to 30% in 2020.\n\nHe hinted that Nigeria still ranks 6th globally among the 30 high TB burden countries and 1 in Africa with about 452,000 people being infected with TB as stated in the 2021 Global TB Report.\n\nHe stressed that there is more to be done by all and sundry as such all hands must continue to be on deck to work together in eliminating the scourge of TB in Nigeria towards achieving a healthy environment for generations to come.\n\nHe further stated that there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure we tackle every challenge including finding all the missing TB cases in the country\n\nAlso speaking, United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Hon Mary Beth Leonard said the US government is keen to funding to support efforts for TB control in Nigeria has surpassed 230million dollars. This support has increased the traditional quality diagnoses and care for TB patients and their families.\n\nWhile adding that, the US government also has invested significant resources in other programs to prevent, detect and treat TB and people living with HIV.\n\nUSAID has done a lot to see that multi-sectoral public-private partnership is robust to increase public awareness and as well advocate for domestic resources to address the TB epidemic in Nigeria.\n\nMore so, USAID has invested significantly in improving access to treatment and case detection services through the provision of directly observed treatment, the optimization of G-next machines, and the introduction of new diagnosis tools established of diagnostic centres across the country.",

          "text": "United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, Tuesday, donated selected items and materials to six Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, camps in Benue state to ensure proper sanitation, cleanliness, and hygiene.\n\nThe items donated to the camps were detergents, disinfectants, scrubbing brushes, hand gloves, and brooms.\n\nFlagging off the donation at the Uikpam IDPs camp in Guma Local Government Area, LGA of the state, the UNICEF WASH Specialist, UNICEF Field Office, Enugu, Mr. Doutimiye Kiakubu told the IDPs that it was being done in fulfillment of an earlier promise made to them by UNICEF.\n\nMr. Kiakubu who recalled the meeting UNICEF officials held with the IDPs said \u201cnot long ago we held a meeting with you and we agreed on what the camps should look like in terms of cleanliness and hygiene; and you told us the type of toilets you want and where it should be situated in the camp. We also agreed on where the male and female toilets should be located. Women, men and even children spoke on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe told you that whatever we do would be within our budget. And we assured that we should start with the construction of women toilets and bathrooms which are almost completed.\n\nThe UNICEF WASH specialist also his organisation is working on the provision of water for the IDPs and as a result has directed the contractor handling the borehole project to ensure timely completion of the project so that there would be water in the bathrooms and toilets.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have already trained the Volunteer Hygiene Promoters, VHPs, and the Water Sanitation and Hygiene Committee, WASHCO, members in the six IDPs camps located in Ortese, Uikpam, Gbajimba, Daudu 1 and 111 as well as Abagena and they have been entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the water and sanitation facilities as well as keeping the camps clean.\n\n\u201cAnd to enable them put to practice what they were trained in, UNICEF has come to donate detergent, scrubbing brushes, brooms, hand gloves and disinfectants which should be used to keep the toilets, and the vicinity of the camp clean.\n\n\u201cWe had to do this because you the IDPs had complained that you lacked materials that could be used to ensure the clean up of the camps, that is why we have brought all these to ensure that the camp including water tap areas, toilets and bathrooms are always neat and completely clean.\n\n\u201cYou should also watch over all these facilities and ensure that nobody vandalizes or damages them. And whoever is caught trying to damage or misuse them should be reported to the block leader, if he refuses to listen to the leader, the matter should be reported to the camp chairman and if the individual remains headstrong he should be reported to officials of State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA. That is what is obtainable at Abagena camp and it should be replicated in others.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that if you maintain cleanliness in the camps other groups might be moved to also render further assistance to your camps. Ensure that everything we have provided for you are handled with care and not damaged.\n\nMr. Kiakubu also appealed to SEMA to ensure that all the facilities are protected and maintained, stressing that if the items are exhausted, SEMA should provide more so that the camp will remain clean always.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that if a camp is kept clean it will be difficult to record outbreak of sicknesses and diseases there.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile work on the solar powered motorized borehole is still ongoing, the tank stand would be completed soon, so please cooperate with the workers to ensure that the contractor executes his work without challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said there are supervisors from Benue Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency, BERWASSA, as well as UNICEF who would supervise the work being done to ensure that it is executed to specification.\n\n\u201cSo like I said earlier, we are making these donations to six camps in Abagena, Ortese, Gbajimba, Daudu l, Daudu lll and Uikpam. And we will always visit the camps to ensure that things are properly done,\u201d he added.\n\nReacting, the camp manager, Mr. Matthew Asaaga,\n\nsaid the intervention of UNICEF was highly commendable stressing that it would go a long way to ensure proper hygiene and cleanliness as well as check the outbreak of water borne diseases and sicknesses in the benefiting camps.\n\n\u201cWe must thank UNICEF because they are taking practical steps to ensure healthy living in Benue IDPs camps; we ask for more and urge others to emulate what they are doing in Benue state,\u201d he said.\n\nOn her part, the WASHCOM Chairman, Mrs. Regina Abaga\n\nwho expressed joy at the various UNICEF interventions in the camp said they were poised to ensure that the camp is always clean especially with the donation of items that would aid their work.\n\nAlso speaking, BERWASSA official, Mrs \u2026..said the donation by UNICEF was in fulfillment of the promise made to the IDPs during the training of VHPs about a week ago.\n\n\u201cThey requested for the cleaning materials that is why this donation is being made today to encourage them to do the work of ensuring cleanliness and hygiene in the camp, we laud UNICEF for this all important intervention,\u201d she added.",

He first contested in 2009 on the platform of the PDP.\n\nThe build-up to the election was characterised by serious campaigning in an atmosphere filled with security concerns and uncertainty.\n\nAmid these concerns, the Federal Government considered declaring a state of emergency in the state to ensure the poll would proceed as scheduled.\n\nIt took the deployment of some 43,000 police officers and hundreds of other security agents, including soldiers for the election to be held.\n\nSoludo\u2019s victory means he will be succeeding Willie Obiano who is in the final months of his second term and that APGA will be retaining power in the state, which it has governed since 2006.\n\nThreats Defied\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty and mounting tension, the election held peacefully as the electorate went to their respective polling units to vote for the candidates of their choice, defying security threats.\n\nObservers monitoring the election, however, reported incidents of vote-buying and failure of accreditation devices \u2013 Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), among others.\n\nThe device failure was also experienced at the governor-elect\u2019s polling unit in Aguata Local Government where he waited for over five hours before he could vote.\n\nThis initially sparked tension at the polling station as just one person out of the 717 registered voters was able to vote, about one and half hours into the election.\n\nElsewhere, the other frontline candidates voted without any glitch recorded.\n\nUneasy Quest\n\nIn events that led to the election, it was an uneasy quest for Soludo in his journey to succeed Obiano as the next governor of the state.\n\nFollowing a series of drama accompanied by the crisis within APGA and conflicting judgements resulting from the party\u2019s primary, INEC finally recognised Soludo as APGA candidate and Ibezim Onyekachukwu Gilbert as his running mate on August 19.\n\nThis followed a judgement of the Court of Appeal in Kano which set aside the judgement of the Jigawa State High Court on the party\u2019s leadership and nomination of candidates.\n\nMore than a month later, APGA officially flagged off its campaign for the election, and Soludo was presented the party\u2019s flag to officially recognise him as its candidate \u2013 bringing an end to all disputes relating to the party\u2019s candidacy.\n\nWatch the presentation of Soludo as APGA\u2019s flagbearer below\n\nAt the event held six weeks before the election, Soludo began his acceptance speech with a song titled \u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019 after which he thanked the party leaders and members for their support all through the events that led to his emergence as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that should happen in Anambra will be to consolidate the wonderful works that are ongoing, especially under the 16 years of APGA in Anambra State,\u201d he promised.",

          "text": "A serial ATM thief and fraudster has been arrested by the Delta State Police Command in Ozoro, Isoko North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the command\u2019s spokesperson, DSP Bright Edafe, said the suspect, Ojo Amos, 38, of Agbara-Otor, Ughelli North LGA, specialises in stealing ATM cards from unsuspecting victims.\n\n\u201cOn 2/11/2021 at about 1300hrs, upon a tip-off that the suspect was seen in a POS Stand located beside a bank in Ozoro branch, the DPO Ozoro Division detailed operatives who swung into action in conjunction with the chairman Olotu vigilante in Ozoro. They were deployed to the scene and arrested the suspect. 33 ATM cards and a cash sum of Fifty thousand Naira (#50,000) were recovered from him,\u201d DSP Edafe stated.\n\nThe suspect admitted to stealing one of the cards from one Rufai Abdulahi at a bank in Kwale and fleeing. He claimed that he afterwards withdrew two hundred and fifty thousand naira (#250,000) from the victim\u2019s bank account.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cpreliminary investigations later revealed that the suspect usually stays behind his victims at the ATM machine waiting and targeting people who he feels are not too educated, old women/children and once he notices that they are having problem operating the ATM machine, he moves closer to them pretending to be a bank staff trying to help them and in the process he swaps the ATM card.\u201d\n\nThe suspect also admitted to watching them enter their ATM pins, memorizing them, and then using a POS stand or ATM machine to empty their bank accounts after swapping ATM cards. For the past four years, he claims to have been doing this.\n\nWhile urging members of the public to be law abiding, Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali also advised them to learn from the cases regularly reported by the command and to be vigilant when using their ATM cards, ensuring that only uniform bank staff are allowed to assist them when the need arises.",

          "text": "Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has adjourned the trial of the leader of the proscribed\n\nIndigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu to January 19, 2022.\n\nHowever, before the judge came into the court room, Kanu\u2019s lawyers, staged a walk-out to protest the refusal of operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to allow some members of the legal team to come into the courtroom.\n\nKanu, who was brought into the courtroom around 9:52am, had shortly after his case was called up, complained about the refusal of security agents to allow some members of his legal team, especially his lawyer from the the United States of America, Bruce Fein, to enter the courtroom.\n\nThe IPOB leader told the court that Mr. Fein, whom he said was handling a case for him in the US, was around to witness his trial.\n\nSpeaking from the dock, Kanu said: \u201cI have an ongoing case in the US. I have not been allowed to see him. He is here to see me and to observe the proceedings.\n\n\u201cHe has been to the DSS to see me, but they denied him access to me.\u201d\n\nAsked by the judge, if he was ready to conduct the proceedings himself, in the absence of his lawyers, Kanu replied in the negative.\n\nMeanwhile, counsel to the federal government, Mr. M. D. Abubakar, who is also the Director of Public Prosecution, urged the court to proceed with the trial in the absence of Kanu\u2019s lawyers.\n\nAbubakar reminded the court that the case was fixed for hearing of an application filed by the Defendant.\n\nHe argued that since Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Mr. Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who was initially inside the courtroom, walked out with his team shortly before the arrival of the judge, his pending application should be deemed abandoned.\n\nIn a short ruling, though Justice Nyako expressed his displeasure over the conduct of Kanu\u2019s lawyers, she declined to dismiss the pending application and rather adjourned the case till January 19 and 20, 2022, for trial.\n\nAs Kanu was being driven away from the court, his supporters started singing his praises.\n\nFrom nowhere, another group called One Nigeria Advocate carrying Nigerian flags appeared with drums, singing in support of the nation. They waved Nigerian flags. They also carried coffins with some names of people killed in the South East including Gulag\n\nWhile those supporting Kanu described him as another saviour, those protesting in support of government called him a terrorist. Some carried coffins with names of some of the people killed in the South East.\n\nThey also carried placards with inscriptions- \u201cIPOB are terrorists\u201d, \u201cIPOB stop killings our security men\u201d, \u201cOne Nigeria one nation\u201d \u201cNNAMDI Kanu is a terrorist\u201d, \u201cIPOB is a terrorist organization\u201d, \u201cRespect your country Nigeria\u201d.\n\nTension rose but did not degenerate probably because security agencies were at alert.\n\nTobi Soniyi",

But in another video, he asks: \u201cWho asked you to stop? Y\u2019all know what y\u2019all came to do \u2013 chase me, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt one point there was an ambulance that was trying to make its way through the crowd. The artist has command of that crowd,\u201d Mr Pe\u00f1a, the chief of the Houston Fire Department, told NBC\u2019s Today show.\n\n\u201cThe artist, if he notices something that\u2019s going on, he can certainly pause that performance, turn on the lights and say: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not going to continue until this thing is resolved\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an Instagram video following the event, Scott said he was devastated about what had happened and was \u201csending prayers to the ones that were lost\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fans really mean the world to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAny time I could make out anything that\u2019s going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need\u2026 I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.\u201d\n\nScott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018.\n\nOn Monday, lawsuits were filed including allegations that Scott and surprise performer Drake incited the crowd at Friday\u2019s event, and that Live Nation failed to provide adequate safety measures.\n\nPolice have launched an investigation, including looking into separate reports that somebody in the audience was injecting people with drugs.\n\nSeveral concertgoers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark in his neck.",
