I could recall back then I use to suffer from similar chronic body pains and arthritis too\u2026\n\n\n\nand I thought the solution was pain killers, booking appointment with a physiotherapist and all that\u2026 but it didn\u2019t help a lot.\n\nAfter some weeks, the pain would come back to haunt me deep down in my bones\u2026 and made me almost a cripple.\n\nPhysiotherapy; Ibuprofen, Herbal concoctions; Diclofenac and some other similar painkillers would appear like they are helping.\n\nBoom\u2026 I\u2019m back to square one.\n\nIt\u2019s like a sky scrapper came crashing on my bones.\n\nThen, my spine started to deteriorate.

          "title": "Osinbajo Presidency greatest legacy Buhari can bequeath to Nigerians \u2014Ajulo",
          "text": "Kayode Ajulo\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nAbuja lawyer and activist, Kayode Ajulo was part of the legal team which\n\nvalidated President Muhammed Buhari\u2019s victory.\n\nThe Mayegun Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland speaks on 2023 elections, his preference for the office of the president and burning national issues. Excerpts:\n\nThe race towards 2023 is gathering momentum, what are your perspectives?\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the race towards the 2023 general election is gathering momentum and you would agree that the aspirants, dreamers and well wishers are getting set on their tracks for the race!\n\nWhat is more, in this part of the divide, politicians always wait till the last lap, and this is the last lap, as we will be having a new President next year.\n\nPoliticians will tell you that they don\u2019t want to start early because of the way the Nigerian system is built, because if they start early, it means they will spend more. This is the dress rehearsal for 2023.\n\nAfter a careful analysis of the leading potential Presidential Candidates in the coming election, it is an undeniable fact that Prof Yemi Osinbajo has no doubt established a strong base upon which we can consolidate for the future and his political ideology has stood the test of time. Prof Yemi Osinbajo has more intellectual endowment, superior pedigree and moral heft than other potential contestants.\n\nMost of those you see, their garments are already tainted. If they don\u2019t have corruption cases on their neck, they are fraught with health related disabilities. A perfunctory and careful synopsis on some of these would be aspirants and dreamers, one would be left in the befuddling quagmire of choosing the right candidate who is the fitting round peg in the round hole.\n\nFrom whatever angle this issue is tilted, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is far ahead of other aspirants in this race towards 2023.\n\nQuite paradoxically, despite the fact that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is yet to officially declare his intention, largely due to the enormous national assignment committed into his hands, yet, the support has been massive from professional groups, ethnic groups, artisans, businessmen and so on, rooting and calling him to declare his intention. I am sure that at the appropriate time, he will yield to the demand of the people, he will declare his intention.\n\nIt will also be interesting to note that though the Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has not formally declared his intention, yet from the recent events, one does not need a soothsayer to know that the cynosure of all eyes are on him.\n\nWhat are the factors that will determine Nigeria\u2019s next president?\n\nCome to think of it, if you are to fly to Lagos today and they bring a pilot who last flew ten or twenty years ago, rickety and old without current experience to fly you to Lagos, I know you don\u2019t need a prophet before you jump off the plane. However, if they bring you a co-pilot who has been flying all around the world with the requisite modern technical know-how and expertise, you will definitely jump on board.\n\nNigerians need a president who is not distant from the agitation and everyday experience of the common people. A grassroots leader who can resonate well with the social vices beleaguering the country and has the capacity to ameliorate same.\n\nWhatever standard, whatever indices you employ, you will find out that at the end of the day that your choice is Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. That is the reason somebody like me and millions of Nigerians spread across the country and beyond are saying it has to be Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nProf. Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s youthful vivacity, unwavering faith in the youth, his enlightened trust in their capability for carving an organic nation out of a disparate country, for me is the high point of the quality that will determine who becomes the next president of the country. The future is now.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the Vice President\u2019s silence is a minus?\n\nLet me state pronto that the words of the legendary Leonardo da Vinci which have stood the test of time like the rock of Gibraltar that nothing strengthens authority so much as silence is quite pungent.\n\nIt is beyond conjectures that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is saddled with a lot of responsibility as the Vice President of the largest country in Africa with over 200 million populace.\n\nAside presiding over matters of national interest, he has travelled to every part of the country and many parts of the world. He is the most engaging public servant in Nigeria. One can readily remember how he escaped death by the whiskers when his chopper was involved in an accident more than once in the line of duty and he survived!\n\nTo state the obvious, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is a man who believes his work should speak for him. He has a principal that he has remained faithful to, and I am sure that aside the Right of First refusal which the Vice President is entitled to, the greatest legacy President Muhammadu Buhari would like to bequeath to Nigerians is to reward the faithfulness, hard work, selfless service and loyalty of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo by supporting his becoming the next President.\n\nI am eagerly looking towards the President being the chief promoter, campaigner of his loyal Deputy, and that is the way it should be as President Barrack Obama did to President Joe Biden. That is my wish, my dream in this coming election.\n\nDon\u2019t you think Asiwaju Bola Tinubu might have an edge if President Buhari considers political expediency in view of the support he gave during the Presidents election?\n\nMake no mistake about it, I have great respect and reverence for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had not only made an indelible mark in the Nigerian political space but also for the people of Lagos State. However, if one must be sincere and not bend the truth by the elbow, Asiwaju\u2019s era has become an incredible hallmark in the history of this Country as I see him more as an elder statesman that we should all go to for tutelage and direction.\n\nI can vividly remember that I was just a man in the University when Asiwaju Bola Tinubu became the Governor of Lagos State, today my daughters are in Universities, how do I explain things to them.\n\nWithout doubt, asking Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to become the next president under the guise of rewarding his support to the President during the presidential election is like calling on the likes of Abedi Pele, and his Nigerian contemporaries to play in the world cup with likes of Ronaldo, Messi, and Mohammed Sala. This is definitely a disaster going somewhere to happen.\n\nFor whether we like it or not, the obvious glares into our very eyes like the morning sun that the world is changing and so must the modus operandi of governance change.\n\nLet me reiterate again, the Presidency is not for sale and same is not to reward the action or inaction of any person. What Nigerians need at the moment without mincing words is a democratically elected government thoroughly equipped with modern political awareness and inclusiveness and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the right fit for the position.\n\nWhat do you consider the greatest legacy this president can bequeath to Nigerians?\n\nTo move the country forward, I believe the greatest legacy President Mohammadu Buhari can bequeath to Nigerians is a Standard of Operation for good governance.\n\nThe President has done so much. In the area of infrastructure, give it to President Buhari. In the area of security, irrespective of the noise about Boko Haram, at least we are still united as a country, we still remain Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nIn the area of corruption, he has showed us that there are no sacred cows. He has fought corruption without political coloration. All his promises, he has fulfilled them in spite of daunting challenges.\n\nThat is why I was surprised when somebody accused me of mocking the President over his health, I said I never mocked the President. It is quite obvious that I have assiduously defended Mr. President\u2019s tenure and have also acted as a Counsel to defend his mandate at the last presidential election tribunals; Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.\n\nIs it any wonder that during the last TV interview the President granted, Mr President gave an honest evaluation of his health status and age. He noted that once his tenure ends, he will go home to rest.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to deceive ourselves. People sometimes mention Joe Biden, forgetting that Biden is American, meanwhile, this is Nigeria. By the time you check the life span of an average American, you see the difference. God has been so nice, so kind to President Muhamadu Buhari, he has survived bomb blast, survived coups and he has enjoyed long life. His name will be written in gold, even diamond. However, we need to move forward. We need somebody that can further build on the existing foundation. Imagine Prof. Yemi Osinbajo on world stage. Imagine him in the world arena, flowing with Presidents of other nations, I know what the pride of being a Nigerian at such moments mean.\n\nImagine the intellectual capacity of the Vice President, imagine his sincerity, imagine his integrity, in a country where news about sleaze, corruption is all over the world.\n\nAnd let me add this for the enlightenment of the people who have questioned the competence of Vice President under the present administration and want the Vice President to operate beyond his constitutional marks, Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s roles as the Vice President have been cut clear by the Constitution, his brief is to take charge in the absence of his Principal as there can\u2019t be two drivers on the wheel at the same time. Give it to him, the few times he spent on the driver\u2019s seat are resounding and instructive of the hope we seek.\n\nZoning is an issue in Nigeria, where do you stand?\n\nLet\u2019s be real, zoning is not an albatross in Nigeria. It was so unfortunate listening to one of the Presidential aspirants speak on the issue. This is a serial Presidential aspirant, saying zoning is not in the Nigerian Constitution, and I weep for the system that propped up such an individual. How can you aspire to be the President of Nigeria without having an informed knowledge of the intent and letters of our Constitution? Too bad!\n\nBeyond the fuddling argument that zoning is not expressly provided for in the Constitution, it is imperative to point attention to certain provisions of the Constitution with particular reference to the fact that the Federation or any part thereof should never be governed by a minority set of persons or ethnic group.\n\nSection 14(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended provides that:\n\nthe composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out of such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few State or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies.\u201d\n\nThe essence of federal character is to ensure that political office is shared in equitable proportion, and you are saying Nigeria\u2019s constitution does not recognise zoning?\n\nI think the uninformed should apologize to Nigerians for saying zoning is not in Nigerian Constitution. This is the same person that had been talking about zoning, now because the table is turning against him, he is saying zoning is not in the Nigerian Constitution. It is so clear that zoning is an integral part of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the PDP would be a difficult match in the 2023 polls?\n\nWhat is the yard stick? I think PDP needs not less than another eight years to put their house in order. If I were one of those managing the PDP, I will request for eight years to purge the party of undesirable elements before thinking of presenting anybody for any elective position. We need to tell ourselves the basic truth, PDP for now should be thinking about filling the posts of Chairman of Council, House of Assembly, not the office of President. Which of the aspirants of PDP can stand on national platform to contest for Presidency? They should wait for another eight years to present aspirants for presidency.",

          "text": "Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum has earnestly urged President Buhari to inaugurate the NDDC Governing Board in accordance with the law, to guarantee equitable representation of the nine constituent states.\n\n\n\nAccording to Chief Tonye Ogbogbula, National President, Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum, inaugurating the substantive Board of NDDC \u201cwill inevitably douse the increased but avoidable tension in the region, and thereby ensure the stoppage of crude oil pipeline vandalisation which has suddenly reared up again in the Niger Delta to the detriment of the nation\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nREAD FULL STATEMENT BELOW\n\n\n\nWe are truly saddened by current reports in the international and national media of renewed attacks on crude oil pipelines in the Niger Delta, which have forced major International Oil Companies such as Shell Petroleum and Agip to declare Force Majeure as a result of their inability to meet their contractual daily crude oil production, thus leading to daily loss of huge revenue to the nation.\n\n\n\nWe therefore earnestly urge President Buhari to inaugurate the NDDC Governing Board in accordance with the law, to guarantee equitable representation of the nine constituent states, which will inevitably douse the increased but avoidable tension in the region, and thereby ensure the stoppage of crude oil pipeline vandalisation which has suddenly reared up again in the Niger Delta to the detriment of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\nAccording to a national newspaper report of Tuesday, March 15, 2022, titled \u201cShell, Eni Declare Force Majeure After Attacks on Oil Facilities in N\u2019Delta,\u201d Shell Plc and Eni SpA both declared force majeure on key oil flows from the Niger Delta, threatening to disrupt supplies. Quoting a Bloomberg report, the newspaper stated that Shell\u2019s measure has been in place since March 3, and applies to its Bonny export programme, while Eni\u2019s relates to Brass crude cargoes and followed a pipeline blast recently in Bayelsa state.\n\n\n\nShipments of the two grades had been planned at a rate of 170,000 barrels a day next month but have been in a state of decline over the past few years, according to loading programmes seen by Bloomberg. Flows back in 2020 were planned at about 320,000 barrels a day.\n\nAlso in another report in a national daily on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, titled \u201cEnergy Crisis: Nigeria To Lose N1.2bn Daily Over Agip Oil Export Cut\u201d it stated that Nigeria\u2019s energy crisis on Monday took a multiple dimension as Agip announced a halt in oil export at its 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) Brass export terminal in Bayelsa sequel to a blast at its facility, which could trigger a $2.84 million (about N1.2 billion) daily oil export loss.\n\n\n\nAccording to the paper, \u201cNigeria has been battling with activities of oil vandals who have been using advanced technology to blow up oil installations,\u201d stating that \u201csuch activities have made it difficult for Nigeria to meet its OPEC quota and by extension lose billions of dollars at a period of rising oil prices in the international market.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe newspaper reports that the latest incident was the second attack in a few days after an earlier incident on February 28 at its Obama flow station led to a production shortfall of 5,000 barrels per day, according to the oil company.\n\n\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s OPEC production quota is pegged at 1.8 million bpd (barrels per day), our country is presently struggling with a production level of between 1.25 million and 1.4 million bpd.\n\n\n\nForce majeure is a legal clause in contracts that absolves firms from legal liabilities due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\n\n\nRecall that the Ijaw Interest Advocates (IIA) also known as Izanzan Intellectual Camp, in a statement by its President, Ambassador Salaco Yerinmene, earlier in the year, also urged President Buhari to inaugurate the NDDC Board and douse the rising tension in the region. The group, in the statement regretted that \u201cthe multi-national companies are now suffering silently, they have been exposed to confront host communities on their own. Nigeria as a major oil producing nation cannot meet up their OPEC production quota just because of some selfish individuals who want to line up their pockets with funds meant to sustain peace and development of a sensitive region like the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, earlier in the year, the 21st Century Youths in Niger Delta and Agitators with Conscience (21st CYNDAC), in a statement by its Coordinator, Izon Ebi, while restating its demand for the inauguration of the NDDC Board so that all the nine constituent states in the region will be duly represented, stated that the region and the country will blame President Buhari for \u201cplunging the Niger Delta region into fresh crisis and grounding the economy of the nation if he fails to inaugurate the NDDC Board.\u201d Izon Ebi also cautioned then that with government\u2019s dismantling of hitherto thriving illegal oil refinery activities in the region, the youths of the region would again resort to destruction of oil pipelines if they are not productively re-engaged, which equitable representation of the nine constituent states on NDDC Board can guarantee.\n\n\n\nHowever, the fundamental basis for the most significant issue that the authentic stakeholders of the Niger Delta have ceaselessly and legitimately demanded is for an end to the illegal Interim Management / sole administratorship at the NDDC and for President Buhari to inaugurate the Board of the Commission in compliance with the law, the NDDC Act.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari also promised the nation on the 24th day of June 2021, while receiving the Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the State House in Abuja that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted.\n\n\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d The Forensic audit report has been submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari seven months ago on September 2, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe situation currently in NDDC which has subsisted for over two years, and created heightened tension and increased agitation in the region, is that there is an illegal sole administrator who is both Managing Director, Executive Director of Finance, and Executive Director Projects, in clear breach of NDDC Act which ensures separation of these duties to ensure checks and balances.\n\n\n\nThe continued administration of the NDDC by Interim management committee / sole administrator is illegal because the NDDC Act has no provision for this illegality as the NDDC Act only provides that the Board and Management of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, nobody is supposed to begin to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through this legal requirement as stipulated in the NDDC Act.\n\n\n\nThe continued illegality of the interim management committees/sole administrator contraptions administering NDDC since October 2019 in breach of the law, NDDC Act, is a national embarrassment that should be of grave concern to President Buhari, most especially for his legacy when he leaves office in May 2023.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari should also be concerned about the disdain of the Niger Delta people over the manner he has handled the NDDC, most especially administering the Commission with illegal interim management/sole administrator contraptions for five years in his nearly seven years in office, and therefore needs to end the ongoing illegality in NDDC if he is to be remembered for good in the Niger Delta.\n\n\n\nTo douse the increased tension in the region, we therefore reaffirm our demand of ending the illegal Interim sole administratorship at the NDDC; inauguration of the NDDC Governing Board in line with the NDDC Act to represent the nine constituent states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, and Rivers, and thereby ensure proper corporate governance, accountability, transparency, and probity in managing the Commission.\n\n\n\nChief Tonye Ogbogbula, National President, Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain and widow of the late Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Bianca, has explained why she slapped the immediate past first lady, Ebele Obiano at the inauguration of the new Anambra State governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo in Awka, the state capital on Thursday.\n\nThe two women had engaged in a spat at the ceremony, momentarily disrupting proceedings at the event.\n\nReports from the event on Thursday had revealed how Ebele walked into the ceremony at about 10.55 am and moved towards the spot where her husband sat but was stopped by Bianca. Ebele, in reaction, appeared to nudge Bianca\u2019s shoulder while the latter appeared to slap her, removing her headgear in the ensuing scuffle.\n\nSetting the records straight yesterday, Bianca said she slapped Ebele in self defence after the latter attempted to remove her headgear in public.\n\nShe explained that she ignored several provocative verbal and physical assaults from the former first lady.\n\nBianca, a member of the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the All Progressives Grand Allaince (APGA), said: \u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof. Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent.\n\n\u201cShe then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, she walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting.\n\n\u201cWhile I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab my headtie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove.\n\n\u201cThis very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me.\n\n\u201cAs she made towards me, I pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Umeh (Chief Victor Umeh), told her to leave me and told APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband, Chief Willie Obiano, who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nMonarch: Ebele must appease the gods, she desecrated Awka land\n\nReacting to the incident in a press statement, the Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, His Imperial Majesty, the Eze Uzu III of Awka, Obi Austin Ndigwe, said that Ebele committed a sacrilege by fighting the widow of the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu.\n\nIn the said statement, the monarch gave Ebele seven days to publicly apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences.\n\nHe said because the wife of the former governor committed a sacrilege by physically assaulting Ojukwu\u2019s widow, he as the monarch of the town would have to appease the gods of Awka land to avoid calamities.\n\nThe monarch also said: \u201cShe should also tender an unreserved apology to the new governor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration.\n\n\u201cThe same should go for the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing-in when she descended.\n\n\u201cThis grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture, I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\u201d\n\nThe monarch said he had spoken with Bianca after the incident and she told him that what angered her was that Mrs Obiano walked up to her and called her unprintable names and queried her presence at the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nHe said Ebele\u2019s action was not only against Bianca but against the spirit of her late husband and founder of the APGA who Bianca came to represent.\n\nNdigwe said: \u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca, but as a direct representative of our late father and leader, Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered APGA.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ebele\u2019s action of casting aspersion on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people.

They now laid ambush to attack officers who ran out of the station for safety.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, two police constabularies by name Ifeanyi and Iyke were killed. Ifeanyi was from Umunkwo in Umuguma community here. He was a final year student at Imo state University in Owerri. I knew him. It is just one year now he was recruited. He was trying to scale the fence when they used machete and cut him. He was sliced. The young man died on the spot. This is very unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe second victim, Iyke was from Avu community. They shot him at one of his legs as he fled. He was later found dead at a water stand where he possibly went to drink water. This is very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered that it took the effort of firefighters from Owerri to quench the inferno.\n\nAnother eyewitness said \u201d firefighters just quenched the fire now. The entire place is in a state of fear and confusion as we didn\u2019t sleep last night. The sound of the guns and bombs were too frightening. The invasion was deadly.\u201d\n\nThe attack came few hours after the Assistant Inspector General of police in charge of zone 9- Umuahia, Isaac Akinmoyede, left the state after a one-day working visit.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson for the police in the state, Michael Abattam, a CSP told The Nation that there was no casualty recorded during the attack.\n\n\u201cThe attack is true but there was no casualty and no policeman was killed as at the time we received the report,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "BY PHILIP NWOSU\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo has warned retiring soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces to be wary of subversive element within the society, urging them to stay away from these elements and remain loyal to the Nigerian military.\n\nAdmiral Gambo spoke at the passing out of 329 military personnel from the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) in Lagos urging the soldiers to also remain loyal to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, especially as the insecurity within country has taken a new dimension.\n\nHe warned the retiring trainees of the centre to beware of the challenges common with post service year, adding that the level of insecurity within the country has taken a new dimension hence they must be wary of subversive elements within the environment and avoid associating with them.\n\nGambo was the Special Guest of Honour during the passing out ceremony of the NAFRC Course 1/2022 Stream one, where 258 Nigerian Army personnel, 59 Nigerian Navy and 12 Nigerian Air Force graduated from the course.\n\nHis words: \u201cSo many challenges are associated with post service life which include how you manage your resources especially your retirement benefits among others.\n\n\u201cAlso, influence from members of your family and friends, management of your physical and mental health as well as integrating with the civil society must be properly managed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge you to be proactive in your conduct in order to overcome these challenges because your loyalty to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the Federal Republic is non- negotiable.\u201d\n\nGambo said that it was also risky for them to embark on a new lifestyle that was above their means or engage in non lucrative ventures, neither should they abstain from physical exercises.\n\n\u201cThe society will expect high moral standards and discipline from you and you will have to prove that you passed through a highly disciplined system.\n\n\u201cI am sure that your training exposed you to several vocational opportunities and general management skills to alleviate above mentioned pitfalls inorder to have a stress-free and meaningful life in retirement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CNS said that the trainee pre-retirement course was designed to reorientate and position them for a successful reintegration into civil life after a commendable service.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that after your graduation, the services at this centre will continue to get positive feedback as you gallantly serve through post service life.\n\n\u201cYou will from now on take full charge as planners and executors of your personal daily activities.\n\n\u201cThis may sound exciting and promising but beware, you will need to properly manage your freedom and make good use of your resources inorder to be successful,\u201d he said.\n\nGambo noted that the graduands were still beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Scheme programme.\n\n\u201cI therefore, adviced you to do the necessary documentation to enable you access post retirement medical care without deduction from your retirement benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CNS urged the graduands to justify the magnanimity of President Muhammadu Buhari who had continued to support the armed forces especially retiring personnel as observed in the enhanced welfare packages.\n\nGambo also commended the leadership of the NAFRC under Air Vice Marshal Idi Lubo for it\u2019s effort at ensuring that discharging trainees are exposed to master trends in global entrepreneurship and management frame.\n\n\u201cYour reviewed curriculum has enabled personnel to benefit from the modern trend of doing business.\n\n\u201cI urge the Commandant to continue this laudable initiative for high quality human resource development so that the high standard for which the centre is known for is sustained,\u201d the CNS said.\n\nAlso speaking, Lubo said that over 50,000 personnel of the armed forces had been trained in NAFRC since it\u2019s inception in the 1980\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe centre has also successfully trained members of paramilitary agencies as well as members from federal ministries, departments and agencies.\n\n\u201cThe training the centre provides help beneficiaries to be equiped with skills for self sustenance and meaningful income while approaching life with a positive mindset.\n\n\u201cThis will enable them contribute meaningfully to their various societies thus reducing crime, criminality as well as other vices from our society,\u201d he said.\n\nAVM Lubo congratulated the retiring trainees of NAFRC Course 1/2022 for the laudable achievement, noting that, \u201cthe successful completion of these courses is proof of your determination, commitment and discipline in the number of years of your active military service to our dear land.\n\n\u201cThe training you acquired in the last three months is to enable you contribute positively to their various societies and thus helping to build a greater Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NAFRC Commandant thanked President Buhari for his continuous support to the development of the military and also extended his appreciation to the families of the retiring personnel for their love and support over the past years.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars

She was happy that she acted swiftly and saved herself the public opprobrium that would have followed her attack.\n\nShe narrated her ordeal thus: \u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival. Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voiced raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrain from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head-tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThe former APGA Chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband, Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an inauguration ceremony that began at 9am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the former governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that the former First Lady of Anambra State chose a high state function such as the inauguration ceremony of the incoming governor of Anambra State, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, who had personally invited me to the ceremony, not only in my capacity as a major stakeholder in Anambra State, but also as a principal member of the Board of Trustees of APGA, to display such crass aggression.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that she is engaging in such outrageous behaviour. What is unfortunate is that by her conduct, she deeply embarrassed not only her immediate family and the peace-loving people of Anambra State, but she has equally displayed utter disregard for the office of Governor, which her own husband was respectfully allowed to enjoy in peace and dignity.\u201d",

          "text": "The siamese twins, India and Pakistan, have virtually been at each other\u2019s throats since the 1947 surgical operation by quack British doctors that separated them.\n\nTheir last dogfight in the skies was in 2019. However, on March 9, 2022, Pakistan with 165 nuclear warheads and India with 156, we\u2019re almost at war. What nearly resulted in conflict was not their fierce differences over Kashmir or any difference for that matter.\n\nWhat happened was that India fired a BrahMos Medium range missile into Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Province damaging property. But luckily, no aircraft were flying around and there were no casualties.\n\nThe baffled Pakistanis who traced the missile launch were not sure what to make of it as it was an unarmed supersonic missile. They waited for the direct hotline between the two military chiefs to ring and get an explanation.\n\nBut it remained silent. As the Pakistanis prepared for a possible conflict, they made a complaint to India. That was when two days later, the explanation came with profuse apologies; the Indian Air Force was checking its systems when due to a technical malfunction, the missile went off.\n\nPakistan\u2019s National Security Adviser, Moeed Yusuf said: \u201cThis missile travelled close to the path of international and domestic commercial airlines and threatened the safety of civilians\u2026It is also highly irresponsible of Indian authorities not to have informed Pakistan immediately that an inadvertent launch of a cruise missile had taken place.\u201d\n\nWith the world saturated by missiles and nuclear arms, it is not impossible that any can be fired due to technical or human errors; in other words, humans can simply sleepwalk into a universal disaster. I often hear an exclamation like: \u2018The Devil is a liar\u2019; but in reality, the Devil is a realist; the best way to avoid a nuclear disaster is to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Africans say, you do not go about sniffing what you forbid; if we do not want a biological or nuclear war, why do we go about producing them?\n\nThe United Nations in Article I of its Convention on the Prohibition of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons, states that: \u201cEach State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities\u2026\u201d But the issue of biological weapons production is the basis of the current claims and counterclaims in the ongoing Ukrainian war in which Russia on March 6, 2022, announced it had uncovered and captured a number of laboratories where Ukraine, with the aid of the United States, was engaged in the development of biological weapons.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced they had discovered that: \u201cComponents of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian laboratories in direct proximity to Russian territory\u2026During the special military operation in Ukraine, the Kyiv regime was found to have been concealing traces of a military biological programme implemented with funding from the United States Department of Defence\u201d. She also claimed that Russia found messages directing Ukrainian bio-laboratory staff to eradicate \u201chazardous pathogens of plague, anthrax, rabbit-fever, cholera and other lethal diseases(from) stored reserves of highly hazardous pathogens\u201d.\n\nThe US which before the United Nations vehemently denied the accusations, however, did not accuse the Russians of planting the laboratories nor that American instructions to the Ukrainians to eradicate the hazardous pathogens rather than let them fall into Russian hands are fake.\n\nThe American position was made more problematic when its embassy in Ukraine issued a statement titled: \u2018Biological Threat Reduction Program\u2019. In reference to the Russian discoveries, the US Embassy said America \u201ccollaborates with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (deliberate, accidental, or natural) of the world\u2019s most dangerous infectious diseases\u201d. The American statement went on to state that: \u201cThe Biological Threat Reduction Program\u2019s priorities in Ukraine are to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the matter came up in the American Senate, the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted: \u201cUkraine has biological-research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of. So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces, should they approach.\u201d\n\nMy concerns are not whether or not the Ukrainian laboratory experiments are for defensive purposes -whatever that means -but that, as it happened in the Indian missile case, there can be accidental discharge or leakage, and before you know it, the world might be battling new pandemics.\n\nThis is also my concern on whether the war in Ukraine might involve the eventual use of nuclear weapons by either Russia or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO. It may not be deliberate, but human errors like that that happened in the case of Indians can occur. Famous scientist Albert Einstein who initially thought the atomic bomb was a good idea, changed his mind, famously saying: \u201cMankind invented the atomic bomb, but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap.\u201d His conclusion was that: \u201cTo have security against atomic bombs and against the other biological weapons, we have to prevent war, for if we cannot prevent war every nation will use every means that is at their disposal; and in spite of all promises they make, they will do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, humanity swore it must never be repeated. That was in 1945. But nuclear weapons increased to 3,000 in 1955 and to over 37,000 by 1965 (US, 31,000 and the Soviet Union 6,000). At this point, there were demands that nuclear weapons should first be drastically reduced, then eliminated.\n\nThis was one of the hopes in the negotiations of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, SALT I signed in 1972. But rather than reduce, there was further proliferation to the extent that they rose to 47,000 by 1975 (US, 27,000 and Soviet Union 20,000) then to 70,300 active weapons in 1986.\n\nThe figures have reduced significantly, but remain very high, with Russia in 2022 having 6,255 nuclear warheads; the US: 5,550; China with 350; France: 290 and United Kingdom: 225 nuclear warheads. Other known nuclear countries are Israel and North Korea. There are others in the queue.\n\nDespite threats, I am not sure nuclear-proliferating countries can stop others from joining the race; so there is a balance of terror. Yet, humanity and nuclear weapons cannot co-exist; one will have to give way to the other. The way out is decommissioning all nuclear weapons; but will the powerful agree to give up their lethal weapons? I doubt it.\n\n",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls. To him, it\u2019s not all racism though. \u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want black people to cross through first\u2014that\u2019s no surprise. But I also think there were too many people at those borders; everyone was on edge. They got the worst of it, the ones who tried to leave in that first week; they saw the worst of everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the invasion, almost all the black students had left Ternopil, and only Fortune and his friends were left. \u201cWhen we went out, people glared at us as if to say, \u2018Why are these ones still here?\u2019 That\u2019s when we knew it was time to leave.\u201d\n\nHe packed a suitcase, left most of his belongings behind, and hightailed it to the Hungarian border where French volunteers were helping African students fill out applications for refugee status and living permits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Fortune is writing the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MBCN) qualifying exams in Nigeria, and then finding a way to get to the UK. \u201cBefore all this,\u201d he says. \u201cI was already applying for visas to leave Ukraine for the UK where my brother is.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s journey is not so certain. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure of what\u2019s going to happen to all of us. They say we can transfer to Hungarian schools, but it\u2019s not certain yet. I\u2019d still prefer to finish in Ukraine, though.\u201d She hopes that the war will end before her 30-day permit is up so that she can return to her apartment in Ukraine where most of her belongings are.\n\nWhen we ask Akam about his next steps, no response comes.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka. After Akumah\u2019s exit as CEO, Akinlade Philips took the role. This new exit means Akumah no longer has ties with Farmcrowdy going forward.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe Task That Must Be Done.

          "title": "Ponzi schemes: Investors\u2019 greed or dearth of investible products?",
          "text": "While Nigeria\u2019s apex capital market regulator continues the \u201ccatch-up play\u201d with the growing number of illegal fund managers also called Ponzi Schemes, investors who are eagerly looking for higher returns should also factor in risking their \u2018investments\u2019 amid regulatory clamp down on the Ponzi merchants.\n\nPonzi schemes are \u2018investment\u2019 schemes that promise unrealistic returns which ordinarily should be treated with caution. The merchants target greedy investors in their push to grow their pyramid schemes which pay returns to their investors from capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources.\n\nBen Llewellyn-Jones, The British Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria had in February during a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) canvassed the need for the SEC to create more alternative options for investments for all classes of people as one of the ways of pulling people away from unregulated space.\n\n\u201cThe more you can create alternative options the easier it is to pull people away from unregulated space and that is why the Sandbox is so attractive to us and why we encourage it. We come across these fintech players and they are formidably driven in their vision,\u201d Llewellyn-Jones said.\n\nThe SEC while reaffirming its commitment to making the capital market attractive to Nigerians of all ages and economic status said the Commission is implementing various initiatives to ensure that products and offerings in the market are accessible to both the young and old whom he said would further deepen the market.\n\n\u201cIn this market what we have seen is that where people do have ready access to interesting products in the regulated market, they then gravitate towards the parallel markets and the Ponzi schemes and really the task of the Commission is to as much as possible move money away from Ponzi schemes to the regulated market,\u201d said Lamido Yuguda, the director-general of the SEC.\n\nTo the apex regulator, investors are always advised to confirm if the investment product, scheme, or company is registered with the SEC before investing. This could easily be done through the SEC website: www.sec.gov.ng or via email to sec@sec.gov.ng; or from other regulatory authorities.\n\nAccording to SEC DG, \u201cWhen we assumed office, we were shocked to know that the average age of the Central Securities Clearing System account holder was over 50 years. The CSCS is a depository so if you are investing in equities you must have a CSCS account.\n\n\u201cThe average age of that account holder was over 50, and that indicated to us that the young people were not participating in this market and when young people are not participating in any market, that market is doomed to fail. And young people today prefer to do things on their phones. If you have to fill a stack of forms manually young people won\u2019t do it. We want to make investing in the capital market a fun experience.\n\n\u201cThe capital market experience starts with a bank account and eventually the distribution has to hit a bank account as well. So we decided to look at the whole process and find out what is turning young people off. We have started the process and seen how the tech companies are providing much-needed relief to the kind of bureaucracy that happens in the capital market.\n\nHe stated that with e-offers, a lot of Nigerians would be happy to invest in the capital market and that would dissuade people from patronising illegal schemes thereby leading to the development of the capital market and the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cBut we get a sense they need to work with regulators to make it work and they recognise that it\u2019s the right way to be attracted to investment and grow the way they want. They are formidably talented and it is really encouraging. We are very keen to work with you and your approach and that\u2019s very heartening and the appetite for innovation is what has attracted us to that the most,\u201d Llewellyn-Jones said.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission recently sealed the premises of Oxford International Group/Oxford Commercial Services, Farmforte Agro-Allied Solutions Limited/Agro Partnerships as well as Vektr Capital Investment/Vektr Enterprise for illegally engaging in capital market activities.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s relevance waning among foreign investors\n\nThe SEC said the offices of the companies in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja were shut down for carrying out investment operations that fall within the ambit of fund management without registration with the apex regulator contrary to the provisions of the Investments and Securities Act 2007.\n\n\u201cThese companies do not have registration of the SEC to conduct fund management activities and have been found to promise exorbitant rates of returns to lure investors. The SEC has exercised its powers under Section 13 (w) Investments and Securities Act 2007, to shut them down. The Commission hereby notifies the investing public that none of these entities or their investment platforms are registered by the SEC,\u201d SEC noted.\n\nLamido had at the opening ceremony of a National Fact-Checking Course organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA) said SEC is engaging NOA as well as regulators of public agencies to curb the activities of illegal operators. Yuguda, who was represented by the executive commissioner corporate services of the SEC, Ibrahim Boyi, stated that Nigeria\u2019s investment climate has continued to witness the proliferation of illegal fund managers (Ponzi Schemes) as the promoters of these schemes continue to defraud millions of citizens, by promising them mind-boggling returns on investments.\n\n\u201cSuch schemes with all the illegality and promises of unrealistic returns have burnt the fortunes of many ambitious investors, from Yuan Dong Ponzi to Galaxy Transport, Famzhi Interbiz Limited, Cowlane and Durell, and the infamous Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM).\n\n\u201cThe upsurge of these schemes has undermined the reputation of the capital market and dampened investors\u2019 confidence, among other things. This has created a considerable challenge to the growth of our market, and the Commission is striving to change the narrative by instilling a fair, transparent, and orderly market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInvestments enable growth in wealth, thus while encouraging more retail investments, we urge you to invest in investment classes and products approved by the SEC, which can be confirmed through the channels provided above,\u201d the SEC stated.\n\nThe National Assembly is proposing a Bill that will empower the SEC to impose stiffer punishment on promoters of Ponzi Schemes and other unregistered investment schemes. This move by the National Assembly is aimed at combating the menace of Ponzi Schemes and ensuring that the regulator of the capital market is well equipped to stop it. This is part of an amendment to the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2007, being proposed by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe second reading of the Bill was done on Thursday, January 20 at the House of Representatives by Babangida Ibrahim representing MalumFashi/Kafur Federal Constituency in Katsina State.\n\nThe amendment is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to Repeal the Investments and Securities Act, 2007 and Enact the Investments and Securities Bill to Establish Securities and Exchange Commission as the Apex Regulatory Authority for the Nigerian Capital Market as well as regulation of the market to ensure capital formation, the protection of the market to ensure capital formation, the protection of investors, maintain fair, efficient and transparent market and reduction of systematic risk; and for related matters,\u201d\n\nThe SEC continues its campaign against illegal operators in the capital market, especially Ponzi Schemes and has adopted multi-level engagements with media platforms and regulators of publicity agencies in order to curb the reach and activities of these illegal operators.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue our activities towards resolving complaints that have been forwarded to the Commission, it is important to reiterate to the investing public to be wary of unscrupulous schemes that promise unrealistic returns on investment.\n\n\u201cWe will like to use this opportunity to reiterate our commitment towards zero tolerance for market infractions. We urge every capital market operator to operate within the market functions approved for it by the Commission. The Commission will not hesitate to deal decisively with any operator who carries out any activities outside the function(s) approved for it by the Commission. No capital market can grow without discipline and adherence to laid down rules and regulations,\u201d Yuguda told journalists after the second capital market committee meeting in 2021.",

          "text": "Damola Andah is a seasoned talent manager with almost a decade in hiring top talents for innovative and successful businesses within the country. She holds an M.A. in Human Resource Management from the University of Leeds Business School, Leeds, United Kingdom (2010) and a BSc. in Mass Communication from Babcock University, Ilishan, Nigeria (2004). She started her career in 2005 as an Operations Officer with Diamond Bank. In 2012, she joined First City Monument Bank on the Management Development Programme. She held various roles, including Human Resources Project Officer, Performance and Talent Management Officer, Senior Talent Management Officer, Human Resource Business Partner, Lagos, & Southwest Regions and Head, Talent & Succession Programme Management (2019). In this interview with the editor, Lehle Balde, she talks about her career in HR and provides advice for young women.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\na) My Parents- they taught me to be unlimited, fair, and compassionate\n\nb) A mentor Temi Dalley- she was (still is) undeterred in changing the face of HR in Nigeria\n\nc) Jumoke Adenowo for her resolve to change Nigeria by raising transformational leaders.\n\nWhat has been the most challenging aspect of your career, and how have you overcome it?\n\nI was changing a career in the middle of a seemingly growing career. I changed careers and was out of a job despite several attempts to volunteer without pay. Having my mindset on the new career while also keeping abreast of developments in that field helped me overcome, and I eventually got a job in my new career line!\n\nWhat have you learned about people and career management over the years as an HR professional?\n\nFrom my experience, I would say career management is not static, and your career is really in your hands. The sky is not the limit \u2013 you can attain any height you want irrespective of where you start; the sky is big enough for everyone \u2013 there is no limit to what can be achieved. Know what you want, strive towards it by getting the relevant skills and certifications, especially with the world being a global village. Anyone can reach the highest level of their chosen career.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young women on career management and progression?\n\nHave a plan, set your target, run with it. Be focused determined. With gender-dominated roles that might seem to have the odds stacked against you, don\u2019t give up, pursue the progression, give it your best shot, strive harder, be surprised at how you can, and be astonished at how you can open previously shut doors.\n\nRead also: Software Group launches fast-track agency banking to reach Nigeria\u2019s unbanked\n\nHow do we encourage women to negotiate higher salaries?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is pay discrimination, especially in structured institutions where job roles already have defined salary ranges; it doesn\u2019t matter whether the office occupants are male or female. However, where such discrimination exists, women need to consider the value they bring to the table with confidence when negotiating.\n\nWhat advice do you have for your women looking to work in HR?\n\nHR is generally seen as a female forte, and some primary female in-built makes it easier for women. Skills like Interpersonal relationships, emotional intelligence, and management have distinguished women in this field. However, with the constant change in workplace dynamics, the skillsets required to perform in HR are also transforming. Qualities like being empathetic remain crucial, but more than before, HR professionals need to be well-versed with capabilities like business partnering, understanding the business, and using data to make informed decisions while still caring for the employees.\n\nIf you say something to your 16-year-old self-something, what would you say?\n\nIf you can dream it, achieve it; the future is loaded with more! Life is a phase, so enjoy and seize every moment while it lasts! Cherish the times and memories!",

The objective of the exercise is to capture all into the Edo State Master Plan as it\u2019s necessary for development.\n\n\u201cFrom now till 31st of March, those that will approach us and apply for their building approval will not be charged but after then, charges will apply. I appeal to all to take this window of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of having your plans are huge as your property is recorded and identified as a legal property on Edo soil and the conveyance letter which is like a legal document is issued to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsure your building is captured at this time as the Ministry is very cooperative and the exercise will continue every Thursday, Friday and Saturday,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, The Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Stephen Idehenre said the state will flag off its farming season on Thursday, March 25, 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe State Government will be flagging off the farming season on Thursday, 25th of March 2022.

Osaigbovo Iyoha, assured the support of the state government to the group, commending its efforts at promoting Benin culture and history amongst the people.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe have travelled wide and have seen our great artworks and artefacts in Museums across the world. One would wonder about the great craftsmanship of Edo people centuries ago.\n\n\u201cYou have come at the right time.

We are working to ensure that the people know about their history and cultural heritage.\u201d\n\nThe governor assured the BCHC that his administration will continue to support the Edo Summer School, organised by the centre to teach Edo children their indigenous language for free.\n\nEarlier, the president of BCHC, Squadron Leader Ehi Ighile (Rtd), noted that the centre was established to revive the Benin culture, promote cultural heritage, teach the Benin language, as well as promote cultural festivals, fashion, songs, and arts, among others.\n\nHe said the centre last year trained over 2,900 children in Edo language in three local government areas of the State, adding \u201cThis year, we have made plans to train our children in Edo language for free in seven local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cWe have trained 300 teachers in Edo language and the government has employed them.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun Debt Management Office (DMO) has cautioned the immediate past Commissioner for Finance in the state, Dr Wale Bolorunduro against misleading the public with wrong narratives as regards the state\u2019s debt portfolio.\n\nThe DMO said Dr Bolorunduro should be reminded that he served as Commissioner for Finance for only three years in an administration which completed two terms of eight years, hence lacks full knowledge of what really transpired under the administration.\n\nThis is contained in a statement by the Director General, Osun DMO, Dr Tunde Adejumo, in response to a write up by Bolorunduro which was published in a weekly local newspaper \u201cThe Osun Defender\u201d last week.\n\nThe DG, Osun DMO, stressed that there was no need for the state\u2019s total debt stock to become a subject of argument when there is a federal repository of debts stocks in the country, explaining that the country\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) keeps records of all borrowings by both the federal and states\u2019 governments in the country.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the State\u2019s monthly loan repayments, and monthly loan deductions from the Statutory receipts, these are verifiable details from both the offices of Accountant-General (AG) of the Federation and Federal Ministry of Finance (FMoF). Therefore, the unending narratives on Osun State\u2019s Debt Stock and loan repayments from the former Commissioner of finance, in our view are mischievous and needless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConcerning the State\u2019s total debt portfolio which Dr. Bolorunduro think is secretive (as it was during his time in the State\u2019s ministry of finance), as usual, our office actually has nothing to hide. According to our records, the State\u2019s total debt portfolio inherited by the current administration was truly well over =N=200billion.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of deductions from the State\u2019s monthly statutory accounts, and fund applied so far for loan repayments by the current administration, as at November 2018, monthly direct deductions for repayment of the State\u2019s loan was =N=2.61billion.\n\n\u201cThis excludes other deductions from the State\u2019s IGR for internal loans\u2019 repayments. This amounted to over =N= 130million. Following the full repayments of the State\u2019s =N=30billion Bond and =N=11.4billion Sukuk in 2019 and 2020 respectively however, direct deductions from the State\u2019s monthly revenue had reduced to =N=1.8billion, while indirect deductions (from the State\u2019s IGR) for loan repayments subsists.\n\n\u201cTotal deductions from the State\u2019s statutory revenue for the month of January 2022, appropriated recently was =N=1,836,968,138.03 (One billion, eight hundred and thirty six million, nine hundred and sixty eight thousand, one hundred and thirty eight Naira, three kobo) only, against a Gross statutory allocation of =N=1.46billion. This can be verified officially from the appropriate agency of the FGN as earlier indicated. I hope our egg-head Doctor could now see that the State government\u2019s claim of negative statutory receipt from the Federation account for the referenced month actually adds up contrary to his insinuation.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubts, we wish to add that till date, the current administration has applied over =N=70billion for the State\u2019s loan repayment. This excludes amount applied for part payment of the Domestic non-borrowing debts such as Pension and gratuity, contractors\u2019 arrears etc inherited from the immediate past administration.\n\n\u201cWhile claiming full knowledge of the State\u2019s financial affairs inclusive of the State\u2019s level of exposure during the preceding administration, Dr. Bolorunduro perhaps needs to be reminded that he served as the State Commissioner of finance under the last administration for only a period of three years ending in November 2014. One therefore wonders why he keeps claiming to be a Registry of all the financial transactions during the whole 8 year tenor of the immediate past administration. Whereas, we are not unaware of his usual clandestine moves and antics in breaking through the State\u2019s firewalls, it will be advisable for him to be sure of his figures at least. It would be recalled that our office had earlier raised concern on his usual contentious statistics and tenuous narratives about the financial affairs of the current government in the State.\n\n\u201cIn his referenced publication, the former commissioner, also made an assertion that monthly loan repayment ordinarily should be met from the State\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). As fiscally logical as this argument sounds, it is quite astonishing that this was not the case when the self-acclaimed Financial Guru was in charge of the State\u2019s finance. As a matter of fact, the State\u2019s IGR was at best, only about 25% of the State\u2019s loan repayment throughout his 3 year tenor as Finance commissioner in the State,\u201d the DG, DMO noted.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Eniitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja 11, on Wednesday said Africans, particularly, the Yoruba race, were the architect of glass technology and had started same before the \u2018colonial masters took it from us.\u2019\n\nThe monarch who spoke at the official unveiling the Igbo Olokun Heritage Site at Ile-Ife in Osun State also said efforts were being Intensified to retrieve all the Yoruba artifacts taken away by the foreigners.\n\nHe said the community is making history in the world through culture and anthropological artwork, showcasing cultural heritage.\n\nAccording to the monarch, arts and culture are significant to every black man living on the surface of the earth because it\u2019s been proven globally that civilization indeed started from the black.\n\nAccording to him, the cradle of civilization has come to stay in Ife as the young generation will come to learn from the history of their forefathers through exhibition of Art work.\n\nHis words: \u201cYoung people go to institutions to learn about physics, chemistry and other sciences, but the main practical sciences have been well established here in Ife over 4,000 years ago and our ancestors have actually come up with initiatives of material science. So basically, we can call them material scientists.\n\n\u201cIt has now been established that technology is behind the glass. We can see today now that we can\u2019t even do without glass technology,\u201d he stated\n\n\u201cThe way we drive our cars, that\u2019s the windscreen that is making us to have visualization but they would probably think that the technology didn\u2019t start from us (we the black people). It has now been proven that we are the first to do it in the world, so, it calls for celebration, not only for, Ife but also for the entire black race, because truly speaking, this is the cradle of civilization and the western world have been trying to dig deep to find out how this whole thing started.\n\n\u201cThey came and told us that they were the ones that discovered River Niger in the early 16th century, the Portuguese. River Niger has been there for many centuries, thanks to our ancestors. But during the research, they went to a market in Kartungua of the old Oyo Empire and they saw some very special objects in the early 18th century, specifically, Richard Ladnah put it in his journal which is all over the museums globally now, that he saw something in Katangua, old Oyo empire and every body said that you can only find it where all of us came from which is the city of Ife. He traced it back here in 1830 and was marvelled to see a very broad-based industry rolling out glass technology in millions and it is being spread across the world.\n\n\u201cThey started doing that research further. Another set came in, Germans came in the early 19th century, Leo Fibohnior came in 1910 and they kept digging and that was when they saw the symbol of Yoruba people which is the Ori Olokun. Some of the first sets were taken from Wumonije compound all the way to British museum, but this was freshly discovered here and it is actually linked to bronze technology, Iron technology which is the Iron and Bronze age, all the way to using Aluminum as a technology, using Copper, using Gold.\n\n\u201cThe Malian empire, the Songai empire headed by Mansa Munsa, we have all seen them coming here to see the way and manner our ancestors were material scientists. So, it calls for celebration for the entire continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cThey will tell us that they are the ones that discovered chemistry, physics, but all that is not true because there is evident here now. So, we in Ife on behalf of the entire Yourba people and on behalf of the entire black people, it has actually been established today and nobody can prove otherwise that we were the first material scientists as far as physics and chemistry are concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have seen glass crucibles here dated over 4,000 years and our ancestors were passing it down from generation to generation and we can see it evidently. What we are using as a symbol for the Yoruba people was first of all dug here.\u201d",

According to Bianca, she was stunned by the fact that the former First Lady of the State was already drunk by the early hours of the day.\n\nBianca, a former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain, gave her explanations in a statement she issued in Awka, the Anambra State capital, on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands.\n\n\u201cShe proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig.

I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9 am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d",

          "text": "Lassa fever, one of the most deadly diseases in Nigeria, has continued to kill more people in various parts of the country.\n\nAlthough authorities say they have continued to monitor the disease outbreak, it appears more needs to be done to adequately contain its spread. The focus has been curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which brought the world to its knees in 2020.\n\nAnalysis conducted by Channels Television indicated that the number of people killed by the disease by mid-March has surpassed the death toll recorded in the whole of 2021.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever first reported in the Lassa community in Borno State when two missionary nurses died from an unusual febrile illness, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nREAD ALSO: NCDC Alerts States As Lassa Fever Death Toll Hits 102\n\nSince that time, the country has continued to report cases and outbreaks, even as people contract the disease by touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to open cuts or sores.\n\nSecondary transmission from person to person can also occur as a result of exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of an infected patient.\n\nAs of March 13 \u2013 representing about 10 weeks into 2022, 112 people died of Lassa fever. This figure exceeds the 102 infected persons killed by the disease in the whole of the 52 weeks of the previous year.\n\nIn its situation report on the disease released on Thursday, the NCDC disclosed that one new death was reported in week 10 \u2013 covering March 7 to 13. Also in the same week, a total of 257 suspected cases were reported, but only 33 of them came back positive.\n\nThe new infections were reported from 22 local government areas of nine states namely: Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Kogi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Taraba, Bauchi, and Kebbi.\n\nCumulatively, in week 10, 630 cases were confirmed so far from the 3,079 infections reported, and 112 people have so far died. At least half of these figures were reported in the 10th week of the year 2021 when 1,211 cases of Lassa fever were reported out of which 191 infections were confirmed with 42 deaths reported.\n\nIn its latest report, the NCDC said at least one case has been confirmed across 87 local government areas of 23 states in the country so far in 2022. Of all confirmed cases, 70 per cent are from Ondo (30 per cent), Edo (24 per cent), and Bauchi (16 per cent). It is, however, unclear if the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has any positive infection.\n\nThe predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (Range:1 to 80 years, Median Age: 30 years), while the male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8. According to the agency, no new healthcare worker was affected in reporting week 10.\n\nIt added that the National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral, and Emergency Coordination Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities at all levels.",

          "text": "Cryptocurrencies have taken on an unprecedented role in the war in Ukraine, helping the government raise millions of dollars to fund its fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nWhy has Ukraine turned to cryptocurrencies, and how is the nascent crypto industry changing its reputation and having an impact amid the clouds of war?\n\n\u2013 How much crypto has been raised? \u2013\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian officials posted addresses for two crypto wallets on their Twitter account, giving donors a direct and clear address to which to send contributions.\n\nThe wallets attracted more than $10.2 million (9.2 million euros) just four days after the start of the invasion.\n\nSince then, more than $100 million worth of crypto has been raised, with the \u201cCrypto Fund for Ukraine\u201d run by Michael Chobanian -\u2013 the founder of the Ukrainian crypto exchange Kuna -\u2013 accounting for 60 percent of all donations.\n\n\u201cWe are still collecting crypto. It is being spent on aid like daily rations and bullet-proof vests and helmets,\u201d the 37-year-old Ukrainian told AFP.\n\nInitially, two funds were set up, one for humanitarian purposes and the other to support the Ukrainian military.\n\nHowever, after the violence escalated across Ukraine, the funds were merged and focused fully on supporting the military, said Chobanian.\n\nHe said that the majority of crypto donations came in the form of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoin Tether \u2013- a coin pegged one-to-one to the dollar.\n\n\u2013 What are the benefits of donating in crypto? \u2013\n\nAid packages sent to Ukraine in fiat money from the United States and the European Union dwarf cryptocurrency donations, but the latter allow individuals to get involved.\n\nUS crypto charity, \u201cThe Giving Block\u201d, told AFP that cryptocurrency donations have the potential to attract \u201cyounger donors\u201d who are looking to support various causes.\n\nAnother reason crypto donations are of value to Ukraine is because they are less influenced by geopolitical or macroeconomic factors. Chobanian points to the depreciation in the value of the Ukrainian hryvnia as a result of inflation.\n\nAn extra advantage of donating in cryptocurrencies is the speed of the transfers. Bank wires may take up to 24 hours to be validated between two countries. However, cryptocurrency transfers typically take less time.\n\n\u2013 What are the drawbacks? \u2013\n\nDespite the success of crypto in aiding the Ukrainian war effort, it has not always been a smooth ride.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict, the deputy minister for digital transformation wanted to issue Ukraine\u2019s own crypto as a symbolic gesture for Kyiv\u2019s cause, but the project was eventually cancelled.\n\nTo make matters worse, people seized the opportunity to mint and market fake versions of the planned government-issued crypto.\n\n\u201cThere was a lack of communication\u201d within the government, said Chobanian, who now works closely with the ministry.\n\n\u201cIt was the first day of the war,\u201d he recalls.\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrencies have become a staple part of Ukraine\u2019s shadow economy \u2013- used as a medium of exchange in online crime, tax avoidance and capital flight.\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Chainalysis, transactions from Eastern Europe to other regions are particularly high, and the company suggests that \u201ccapital flight could account\u201d for some of the crypto movement in the area.\n\n\u2013 What are the consequences? \u2013\n\nDespite the risks associated with crypto, Chobanian is confident that it will become a core part of the Ukrainian economy.\n\n\u201cWhen we win the war, we will rebuild Ukraine using blockchain technology. All of us were helped by crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Chobanian\u2019s aspirations may be very ambitious, they are based on real developments.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky passed a law that would provide a legislative framework for crypto platforms and users to operate within the country.\n\nCaroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis, told AFP that the conflict in Ukraine \u201cis forcing governments to develop their understanding of cryptocurrencies and their regulation\u201d.\n\nShe believes that such discussions can be beneficial to the crypto industry, leading to \u201cproportionate and effective regulatory policies\u201d.\n\nAs of last week, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order seeking further clarification and guidance on crypto regulation \u2014 showing Washington\u2019s willingness to contend with an ever-growing and new asset class.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Zelensky Calls for Meaningful Peace Talks as Russia\u2019s Grip on Mariupol Tightens",
          "text": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Saturday for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow to stop its invasion of Ukraine, saying it would otherwise take Russia \u201cseveral generations\u201d to recover from its losses in the war.\n\nSince President Vladimir Putin launched the assault on Feb. 24, Russian forces have taken heavy losses and their advance has largely stalled.\n\nHowever they have laid siege to cities, blasting urban areas to rubble, and in recent days have intensified missile attacks on scattered targets in western Ukraine, away from the main battlefields in the north and east of the country.\n\nOn Saturday Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its hypersonic missiles had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in the western Ivano-Frankivs region. Missiles also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port of Odesa, the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry as saying.\n\nAs air raid sirens sounded early on Saturday in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr regions, there were no immediate reports of fresh attacks, while efforts to evacuate civilians from cities under siege continued.\n\nThe governor of the eastern region of Luhansk said there would be a ceasefire on Saturday morning and a humanitarian corridor for evacuations will be opened.\n\n\u201cA \u2018regime of silence\u2019 has been agreed for March 19, starting at 9 a.m.\u201d (0700 GMT), Serhiy Gaidai said in a message on Telegram. Luhansk lies in Ukraine\u2019s coal-rich Donbas region that has been partly controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.\n\nGaidai, the head of the Ukrainian administration in Luhansk, has said 59 civilians have been killed in the region since the start of the war.\n\nUnprecedented Western sanctions aimed at crippling Russia\u2019s economy have yet to halt what Putin calls a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d its neighbour.\n\nAfter Russia said it was \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around the besieged port of Mariupol, Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry acknowledged on Friday it had \u201ctemporarily\u201d lost access to the Azov Sea, which is a strategic connection to the Black Sea.\n\nZelenskiy alluded to Russia\u2019s losses in a video address early on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia\u2019s losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.\u201d\n\nRussia last acknowledged on March 2 that nearly 500 of its soldiers had been killed; Ukraine says the number by now has reached many thousands.\n\nKyiv and Moscow reported some progress in talks this week towards a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security, while keeping it outside NATO. But Ukraine renewed its calls for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops, and each side accused the other of dragging out the talks.\n\nPutin promised tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at a soccer stadium in Moscow on Friday that Russia \u201cwill absolutely accomplish all of our plans\u201d.\n\nCHINA\u2019S ROLE\n\nThe United States has repeatedly said Russia may turn for assistance to China, the biggest power that has not condemned the assault.\n\nIn a video call on Friday, President Joe Biden told China\u2019s President Xi Jinping there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d if Beijing provides \u201cmaterial support\u201d to Russia in Ukraine, the White House said, bringing up sanctioning Beijing was an option.\n\nChina and Russia deny Beijing is considering giving Moscow military aid. China says it wants to see an end to the conflict.\n\nMore than 3 million refugees have fled over Ukraine\u2019s western border and Ukrainian authorities have been seeking to evacuate civilians from besieged cities via humanitarian corridors. Kyiv said it hoped to open 10 such corridors on Saturday.\n\nSome of the heaviest fighting has been in Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands have been trapped since the first week of war. Officials there say fighting has reached the city centre and that near-constant shelling was preventing humanitarian aid from getting in.\n\nRescue workers were still searching for survivors of a Mariupol theatre which local authorities say was flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theatre.\n\nIn his video address, Zelenskiy said more than 130 people have been rescued from the rubble but there was no information about how many people had died in the theatre, where hundreds had been sheltering.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Friday evening returned to Abuja after a two-week medical check up in London, the United Kingdom.\n\nThe President whose official plane, Nigeria Air Force 1, touched down by 7.10pm at the Presidential wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, was received by top government officials including his Chief of Staff (CoS), Prof Ibrahim Gambari; FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello; Minister of Water Resources, Engr Sulieman Adamu; Police DIG, Hassan Sanusi; Director General of DSS, Mr Yusuf Magaji Bichi and Media Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina.\n\nSpeaking on the import of the return of the President, Adesina said the President\u2019s return would be most significant in providing direction to the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), as it prepares for its National Convention.\n\nOn what Nigerians should expect from the President as he returns, the Media Adviser stated that \u201che will continue what he\u2019s doing. 14 more months and the administration breasts the tape. He\u2019s going to give in his very best so that he lands safe and sound. And now particularly that APC has, or has had issues, and it has it\u2019s convention ahead of him, the President has come at a good time to bring back better cohesion into the party and get the party to hold a successful convention\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the President returned to the country two days short of the earlier planned two weeks is an indication that he is in top form, health wise and ready to continue with his duties.\n\n\u201cAll is well, that ends well. He said he was going and he will be away for 14 days, today is the 12th day. So the fact that he came about 48 hours earlier shows that all is well with him physically, spiritually, and we\u2019re glad to have him back\u201d Adesina said.\n\nPresident Buhari had in the course of his medical vacation in London on Wednesday intervened in the internal crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) saying Mai Mala Buni remains the interim national chairman of the party.\n\nIn a two-page letter dated March 16, 2022 personally signed by him, addressed to Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State who is also the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, President Buhari intervened in the uncertainties currently rocking the APC.\n\nAccording to him the, the multiplicity of cases currently rocking the party has the prospect of invalidating the activities and actions of the party by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIn the letter which was also copied to the Chairman of Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), the Acting Chairman of the CECC, Governor Sani Bello, the Director General of the DSS as well as the Inspector General of Police, the President said since the party could not change the leadership of the CECC without infringing on the time limit set by INEC, and the fact that the current uncertainties and controversies \u201cpose a real threat to the party,\u201d he has therefore directed that the issue of the leadership of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC) should immediately return to status quo ante.\n\nHe also asked all members of the Governors Forum and their followers to desist from any behaviour or utterance that will likely lead to disunity in the ranks of the party, and ultimately jeorpadise the transition to the convention.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee should accordingly be allowed to proceed with all necessary preparations to hold the convention as planned- unfailingly on 26th March, 2022.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on Sunday, March 6, 2022 departed Abuja for London, the United Kingdom Kingdom for routine medical check up.\n\nThe President\u2019s official plane, Nigeria Air Force 1, took off from the Presidential wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari was seen off at the airport by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; service chiefs, Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba and his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, among other top government officials.\n\nThe President, who returned from Nairobi, Kenya on Friday, March 4, 2022, after attending a three-day international summit of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) was away in the UK for less than two weeks.",

          "text": "Russian businessman Roman Abramovich transferred a company he controlled with tens of millions of dollars of investments to a director of English soccer club Chelsea on the day Russia invaded Ukraine, UK corporate filings showed.\n\nIt was the second time Chelsea owner Abramovich moved assets to a close associate before Britain and the European Union imposed sanctions on him this month.\n\nAfter Britain was initially slower than the United States and the European Union in imposing sanctions following the Feb. 24 invasion, British lawmakers complained that the government was giving oligarchs time to move their assets out of the country before any curbs were announced.\n\nAbramovich did not respond to requests for comment left with Chelsea and his spokesperson. A British government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbramovich, 55, became one of Russia\u2019s most powerful entrepreneurs mostly from oil and aluminium during the chaotic aftermath of the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes last month put his net worth at more than $13 billion.\n\nBritain and the EU imposed sanctions such as asset freezes on Abramovich and hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, targeting people accused of propping up Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAbramovich has denied having close links to Putin.\n\nA Reuters analysis of corporate filings in London and Amsterdam showed Abramovich was previously listed as the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of Cyprus-based Ervington Investments Limited. The company has made investments in at least eight firms, including in Russia\u2019s top search engine Yandex, the filings showed.\n\nOn Feb. 24, Eugene Tenenbaum, a director of Chelsea who is described on the club website as one of Abramovich\u2019s \u201cclosest associates\u201d, took full control of Ervington, according to a filing with the London Stock Exchange. Neither Britain, the EU nor the United States has placed sanctions on Tenenbaum.\n\nTenenbaum said in a statement to Reuters that his company purchased Ervington Investments from a trust in which Abramovich and his children were previously the beneficiaries. He said the purchase from the trust, called Norma Investments, was in compliance with laws and regulations. Tenenbaum declined to say how much he paid for the stake.\n\n\u201cErvington is a company that I have worked with for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the company\u2019s investments and employees well, and buying Ervington provides me with an opportunity to continue to work with this business, under my control and for my, and the employees\u2019 benefit.\u201d\n\nASSET MOVEMENTS\n\nLondon-based lawyers said the move meant that the assets held by Ervington would not be subject to the freeze imposed on Abramovich\u2019s other assets.\n\nAbramovich has handed control of two companies to business associates since the war began, according to corporate filings.\n\nAlso on the first day of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine, which Moscow calls a special operation, Abramovich moved Norma Investments to another associate, David Davidovich, UK corporate filings showed. The Norma transfer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and has been confirmed in the filings.\n\nReuters was unable to reach Davidovich immediately for comment.\n\nBritain imposed sanctions on Abramovich on March 10, saying he had profited from transactions with the Russian government and special tax breaks.\n\nThe British government said Evraz, a steel company in which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, could contribute to the war against Ukraine and supply steel for Russian tanks. Evraz has denied this, saying it only supplies steel to the infrastructure and construction sectors.\n\nEvraz has not been sanctioned by the British government. Its London-listed shares were suspended by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority after Abramovich was sanctioned. Tenenbaum was among 10 of Evraz\u2019s board members who quit on March 11 because of the Abramovich sanctions, the company said.\n\nAbramovich put reigning European champions Chelsea up for sale on March 2, but following the sanctions announcement, the club was made to operate under a special licence and is now effectively controlled by the British government.\n\nSeveral potential buyers of Chelsea have confirmed their interest and the deadline for the first round of bids is Friday. read more\n\nRELATIONSHIP ENDED\n\nTenenbaum, 57, was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and has been on Chelsea\u2019s board for 19 years. He was previously the head of corporate finance at Sibneft, an oil company sold in 2006 by Abramovich.\n\nTenenbaum said in his statement that he does not agree with the way Abramovich has been publicly characterised. The British government said when it sanctioned Abramovich that he had been a close ally of Putin for decades.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the unjust measures imposed on Mr Abramovich will be reassessed,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, as a British citizen and due to the new regulations, I am unable to continue to work with him personally.\u201d\n\nErvington has served as an investment vehicle for Abramovich for at least eight years. It was among investors who put $600 million into Yandex in 2020 and who put money into Via, a ride-sharing app.\n\nTenenbaum moved to Canada at a young age and previously worked for accounting firm KPMG in Toronto, Moscow and London, according to the Chelsea website.\n\nReuters",
