          "title": "Buhari\u2019s cow routes gazette doesn\u2019t exist, grazing ban stays, say states",
          "text": "Ondo, Delta, Cross River, Enugu, Benue and Akwa Ibom state governments on Sunday faulted the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over the existence of a gazette, which marked out grazing routes for cattle across the country.\n\nOfficials of the state governments, who stated this in separate interviews with The PUNCH, also insisted on the ban on open grazing despite the President\u2019s opposition to it.\n\nRecall that Southern governors at their meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, last month banned open grazing as part of measures to address killings by herdsmen.\n\nBut the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, faulted the governors, saying their action was like banning the sale of spare parts in the North.\n\nDespite criticism Malami\u2019s statement attracted, Buhari, during an interview with Arise Television on Thursday, supported open grazing.\n\nHe said he had directed Malami to produce a gazette, which delineated grazing routes in all parts of the country in the First Republic.\n\nThe President stated, \u201cWhat I did was to ask him to go and dig the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) were moving up country, north to south or east to west. They had to go through there.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman South-South Governors\u2019 Forum and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, said as of 1963, the state had not been created.\n\nThe governor, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Olise Ifeajika, stated, \u201cYes, Mr President directed the AGF to dig out a gazette of 1963 which marked out cattle routes across the country.\n\n\u201cDelta State has no such law because the 1963 gazette he talked about does not in exist in the state.\u201d\n\nOn Buhari\u2019s support for open grazing, Okowa said whether the President backed it or not, the governors in the South had made their position on the ban on open grazing known and nothing would change it. \u201cWe stand by our resolutions,\u201d he stated\n\nShow us grazing route in Ondo, if it exists, Akeredolu\u2019s aide tells FG\n\nAlso, the Ondo State Government said it was oblivious of the existence of any grazing route in the state, adding that it stood by the southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing, despite Buhari\u2019s support for it.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the state Governor on Agriculture and Agric-business, Mr Akin Olotu, in an interview with The PUNCH, said cattle routes were not known to be existing in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know about any grazing routes in this state, and if they have them in their records, let them show us. I think events have taken over such things now. What I mean is that, that time they were talking about what was the population of the country? Now Ikere Ekiti and Ado are almost one. Akure is almost joined with Owo. Akure and Ondo are almost merged .\n\n\u201cSo where are the routes? Then the population of the country was about 60 million. What is the population now?, Where are the routes? So like I said , if they show us the routes, then we will know what to do next.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when contacted, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Mr Charles Titiloye, said he was not aware of any gazette which marked out grazing route in the state.\n\nOn open grazing, the state government said it still stood by the decision of the southern governors, which banned it.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the state Governor on Security Matters, Alhaji Jimoh Dojumo, who spoke to one of our correspondents, said the state would not allow open grazing of cattle in the state in spite of the pronouncement of the President.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Southern Governors\u2019 Forum has spoken at the meeting in Asaba (Delta State). They(the governors) have banned open grazing in the South. They even issued communiqu\u00e9 on the matter. That is where we stand in Ondo State.\n\n\u201cThere is no going back on the ban on open grazing, no land would be given for open grazing or grazing routes for cattle in our state.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Cross River State Commissioner for Agriculture, John Okon Owuna, said he was not aware of grazing routes in the state.\n\n\u201cI am not aware if cattle routes exist in the state or a gazette which marks out cattle routes. All I know is that we have the Obudu Cattle Ranch,\u201d the commissioner told The PUNCH.\n\nThe Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, also kicked against Buhari\u2019s plan to reactivate old grazing routes in the country.\n\nOrtom, in an interview with journalists, said there was no part of Benue State that was designated as a grazing route.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI want people to know that we have a law in place and the law doesn\u2019t breach the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria. I want to believe that our law is a win-win thing to provide security for the farmers and herdsmen against cattle rustling.\u201d\n\nNo grazing routes in Enugu, herders shouldn\u2019t encroach on others\u2019 businesses \u2013Commissioner\n\nThe Enugu State Government said that it did not have any gazette on cattle routes,\n\nThe state Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Matthew Idu, who spoke to one of our correspondents in Enugu, said that cattle rearing was a private business.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have not seen such a document on cattle routes, neither has anybody informed me of any.\n\n\u201cCattle rearing is an individual business. It is not a government business. So I don\u2019t see why government should be involved in a private business. So it is a private business and those who are doing their private business should look for how they could do their business successfully and efficiently without encroaching on other people\u2019s businesses.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Information and Strategy Mr Ini Ememobong, also told The PUNCH that there were no grazing routes in the state.\n\nLaw not a federal law, Buhari lacks powers to implement it \u2013 Senator\n\nSenator representing the Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru, in an interview with one of our correspondents on Sunday, said the President lacked legal and constitutional powers to revive the old grazing routes, anywhere in the country.\n\nBasiru, who holds a doctoral degree in Property Law, spoke to one of our correspondents in his capacity as the Senator representing the Osun Central Senatorial District.\n\nAlthough, Basiru is the Spokesperson for the Senate, the Senator said he could not speak in that official capacity because the upper chamber had yet to take a position on the matter.\n\nThe lawmaker said he spoke as a Nigerian who is knowledgeable in the area of constitutional law.\n\nBasiru clarified that the issue of grazing routes was not known to the Nigerian constitution and that Buhari did not have any power to direct the implementation of any law that was alien to the country\u2019s legal books.\n\nHe explained that the gazette that Buhari was referring to was a product of a decree promulgated in the northern Nigeria in the 1960s.\n\nHe argued that the Land Use Act, which is recognised by the Nigerian constitution, had rubbished the so-called grazing routes gazette.\n\nThe Senate spokesperson specifically stated that the Land Use Act had transferred to state governments, the sole power to legislate on use of land for any purpose, including grazing.\n\nBasiru said it was only governors of the northern part of the country that could individually make laws to identify grazing routes because the gazette, which Buhari referred to, had become obsolete.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigerians do not need to criticise the President for making that statement, rather, they should find out whether the President had actually been properly advised by his Attorney General and the legal team.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be concerned over whether the Nigerian President is actually getting the correct legal advice from his Attorney General and the legal team.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, as a legal practitioner, there is nothing like grazing routes or grazing reserve law, in the laws of the Federation of Nigeria. There is nothing like that.\n\n\u201cThere is no federal legislation that the President can implement over such matter.\n\n\u201cThe executive powers of the President merely rely on the powers of the National Assembly to make laws, when you look at Section 5 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAny area where the National Assembly cannot make laws, and there is no express grants of powers to the President under the Constitution, a purported exercise of power by the President in that regard, will be null and void because it is inconsistent with the Constitution by Section 1(3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cI have painstakingly looked at the laws of the Federation of Nigeria and I did not see a copy of any law that is called federal grazing law, or grazing Act or any other title relating to the issue.\n\n\u201cI am aware that there is a northern Nigerian law on reserve and grazing routes which was promulgated by a 1964 decree by the premier of the defunct northern Nigeria region.\n\n\u201cIt is not a federal law unless the legal adviser to Mr President is equating a northern Nigeria law, which is not applicable in the West, Mid-West, and Eastern region or in anywhere in the southern part of Nigeria, to be a federal or a Nigerian law.\n\n\u201cThe President does not have the power to implement that law because it is not a federal law.\n\n\u201cHe can only implement federal legislation made by the National Assembly or deemed to have been made by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe grazing routes law is not a National Assembly law, so there is nothing for the President to implement.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that the President has not been properly advised by his Attorney General and the legal team.\n\n\u201cIf anybody will implement any law, it is the states where those routes are applicable that could do so.\n\n\u201cGrazing routes law is not applicable in any state in the southern Nigeria.The southern Nigeria has its own law on cattle.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate when we have a situation whereby the President of Nigeria is being misadvised by his legal and policy team, for whatever reason it is.\n\n\u201cThere has been informed legal opinion on this issue. So there is no federal law regarding grazing routes.\n\n\u201cEven by the allocation of power, under the Nigerian legislation, the National Assembly and by virtue of that, the President does not have power to do anything about grazing routes.\n\n\u201cThis is because the management of land in the entire territory of a state, by Section one of the Land Use Act, is vested in the governor.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "At least 936 students of secondary and tertiary institutions were abducted by suspected bandits and Boko Haram members across the country between December 2020 and June 5, 2021.\n\nFindings by our correspondents showed that abductions were carried out across the country.\n\nDuring the period under review, abductions were recorded in Ohordua, Edo State; Effurun, Delta State; Kankara, Kaduna State; and Mahuta village, Katsina State.\n\nOther places where cases of abduction were recorded are Kagara, Niger State; Jangebe, Zamfara State; and Afaka, Kaduna State, among others.\n\nSome parents who spoke to our correspondents said they would not allow their children return to school.\n\nOne of them, Alhaji Ibrahim Bageba, whose children were among the kidnapped Jangebe schoolgirls, said, \u201cI have decided to withdraw my children from school because of the security situation in the whole country.\n\n\u201cOur children are no longer at ease due to rampant cases of student abduction across the country and as such, I feel that it is better to withdraw my children so that I will have peace of mind.\u201d\n\nA mother of two of the students who were abducted by bandits during the Jangebe School abduction, Hafsat Sani, said, \u201cMany parents are skeptical about the government\u2019s readiness to fight banditry. As such, I don\u2019t think my children will return to school.\n\n\u201cTwo of my children were kidnapped; I will not allow them go back unless something tangible is done.\u201d\n\nThe Director of Press, Ministry of Education, Bem Goong, told The PUNCH that the Federal Government was working hard to ensure that schools were safe.\n\nHe urged state governments to also do the same.\n\nGoong said, \u201cIf you go to our unity schools, you will notice the presence of security operatives. During the 2021 Common Entrance Examination monitoring exercise, the permanent secretary also added that unity schools are the safest and it is because we have deployed security operatives there.\u201d\n\nThe Zamfara State Government said it would close down boarding schools till security situation improved in the state.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Education, Aliyu Tukur, said, \u201cA committee has been constituted to look into the possibility of reopening the boarding schools that are not prone to attacks by bandits. We have deployed security operatives in schools that are open and we have organised workshops for school principals.\u201d\n\nA security expert, Nnamdi Chife, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to resuscitate the Safe School Initiative.\n\nChife said, \u201cThe government of President Jonathan designed a security strategy called Safe School Initiative, which was meant to provide comprehensive security for the schools that were under attack by the Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cIt is high time for this administration to resuscitate that security programme to provide safe corridor for students. Otherwise, we may lose a generation.\u201d\n\nAnother expert, Olalekan Ojo, said, \u201cSchool abduction is becoming worrisome and some of us have been calling for a national security summit on this issue. A national security summit will involve school owners, security experts and other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nOjo said if nothing urgent was done, the number of out-of-school children in the country could increase to about 30 per cent of the student population.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nwants Igbo governors to implement Ebubeagu security outfit\n\nBy Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\n\nIgbo leaders under the Igbo National Movement, INM, yesterday called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to order military out of the five states of the Southeast region.\n\nThe INM made this call in their statement to newsmen in Owerri and signed by the President, Anthony Olisa Okolo, alongside other leaders, Barr. Eze Eluchie, Chief Ben Okoro, Chief Peter Agba Kalu, Nze Ugo-Akpe Onwuka, and Onyemuche Mbachu, regarding the number of military men in the name of insecurity.\n\nTheir reason for calling for the withdrawal of the military was that they were worried of \u201cA blanket shoot-at-sight order has been given by Nigeria\u2019s Police Chief to policemen on a special operation in the South-East region, accompanied by statements and directives which have already been put into effect with the deployment of hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers and security personnel accompanied with requisite military hardware.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSOArise Interview: Buhari takes delight in ridiculing Igbos, utterances unpresidential \u2014 Afenifere\n\nFor this among others the Igbo group insisted that, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government should as a matter of extreme urgency embark on express efforts to demilitarize Ala-Igbo and the South East and de-escalate the state of insecurity, by ordering an immediate withdrawal of the military from the streets of South-East cities and communities in Ala-Igbo;\n\n\u201cThat the five South-East State governments of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and the Imo States, should as a matter of urgency codify and operationalize the indigenous security outfit which they had all committed to for the region \u2013 Ebube-Agu. Said Ebube-Agu security outfit should as soon as possible, in collaboration with indigenous establishments such as the Town Unions, step in to restore a bottoms-up approach to security in the region.\n\n\u201cThat the five State Governments in the region, firstly at the Local Government levels, then at the State and finally at the regional level, organize multi-sectoral non-partisan all-stakeholders Dialogue Process/Summit on Security. Solutions proffered at this Dialogue Process/Summit should be implemented as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Ndigbo as a people do not engage in foul, incendiary, and uncouth language to achieve our aims or to assert our guaranteed freedoms. Therefore, they advise that Igbo groups and their leadership who does such do not represent the views of all Igbos, and should not be used by the Federal Government to characterize the disposition of the entire South-Eastern geopolitical zone towards the rest of the country, as Ndigbo are firmly committed to non-violent and constitutional means for advancing our demand for a fair, just and equitable country,\u201d The Igbo leaders said.",

When we begin to support each other give credit to the right people who work so hard and do their jobs right then we can take the competition to anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked what inspired his latest wave making release, Kere, Pato Jaz whose love for music started at an early age said,\u201d \u201cKere\u201d was inspired by Burna boy and Wizkid.\n\nThey proved to we the upcoming musicians and everyone out there that nothing is impossible. When I watched Burna on the grammy award\u2019s night making his speech, it inspired me.\n\nIt was something very great, so I took the word Kere from his speech and made a song out if it for everyone to vibe to.\n\n\n\nMy other songs released are Jara\u2019e, Kadija, Ire, Bobo featuring Sosa-E, NGNG featuring Bella shmurda, Owanle, blow bi burna featuring Jay rhymes, dollar pounds and many more.\n\n\n\nWhile my favorite Nigerian music stars are Olamide and Wizkid because they have pure talent. It\u2019s not easy to be able to switch vibes and own your own vibe at the same time. It\u2019s incredible how those two create music.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite being a greenhorn in the music industry, Pato Jaz has encountered some challenges in his choice of career, he also hinted on how did he scaled through the hurdles.\n\n\n\nHear him, \u201cthe only challenge I had was my Dad and Mum. They always wanted me focus on school. They felt any other thing aside school is a waste of time but I had to make them see the bigger picture.\n\nI tried my best to make sure I showed them signs of winning in my music career so they could support me. To the Glory of God they later accepted it but still wanted me to focus on school.\u201d",

          "title": "Money, not sex, freaks me \u2013Angel Emeka, actress",
          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nGifted with the talent to crack jokes, Angel Emeka earned herself first movie role a few years ago, and since then she has not looked back.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, the single mother of two talked about her career, love, sex and marriage. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you get into the movie industry?\n\nA costumier of mine who is a Nollywood script supervisor by name, Ebuka, may his soul rest in peace, came to my boutique with his friend, Chinedu Arinze, a location manager. They came to buy some stuff and I cracked them up, they laughed all day and told me that I can do well in the film industry. I laughed at them and had a flash back on what my mom always told me that she sees me as an actress in future, and since then I have always dreamt of it. So, I decided to give it a trial, and I went with them to the movie location in Asaba where they introduced me to a movie producer called, Solo Amaco, who gave me a role instantly to act with Joyce Kanu. I was so much scared of acting with her because that was my first time of meeting her, and I started crying due to the fear in me. But Madam Joyce Kanu noticed it was my first time and she consoled me and gave me the courage never to be scared. Being a market fight scene, she asked me to see her as my friend and fight her as if we\u2019re fighting for real, which I did in fear and the job came out well.\n\nHow was your growing up?\n\nGrowing up wasn\u2019t easy for my siblings and I, because we lost our dad at an early stage; but my mom is a strong woman. May God keep her for me!\n\nWhat was the first movie or series you acted in?\n\nThe first movie I acted in was Hour of Tears.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced when you first got into the industry?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to have a break when you\u2019re new because the producers and directors do not know how good you are. So, many of them find it very difficult to cast you in a movie, but I prayed for God\u2019s favour, which has been working for me till now.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nMy kids and my business, I don\u2019t joke with these two. I love spending quality time with my kids and anyone that knows me very well will also tell you that I am a business tycoon and an entrepreneur, but my career has taken most of my time.\n\nHow many movies have you acted in so far?\n\nI can\u2019t recall exactly the number because I stopped counting six years ago.\n\nWhat current projects are you working on?\n\nI am working on my personal movie titled, Highlander, which is on post-production. I also finished a movie project, which I produced last month and it\u2019s currently airing on YouTube as we speak. The title is Village Jagaban.\n\nWhats your first experience in front of the camera, were you nervous?\n\nI wasn\u2019t nervous, because Joyce Kanu carried me along. But in my second movie, I was nervous because an actor made the set so uncomfortable for me. He shouted at me, saying I was not acting well, which made me cry like a baby. I ran to my car and went home because the shame was too much for me. However, the director made him to understand that I was new in the game and he felt bad, apologized and encouraged me to be stronger. Today, he is my bestie.\n\nWhat were you doing before this and what was the experience like?\n\nI was into importation of red wine, and boutique business. I was enjoying it because business is my thing as well.\n\nWhat was the turning point in your career?\n\nWhen I produced my first movies, Love From Panya and Dino`s Family.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI go for vacation with my kids, visit the zoo and chill with my girls.\n\nWhat quality or sexy part earned you your first movie role?\n\nIt\u2019s my Chinese baby face, bowlegs, hard work as well as my size. Amaco gave me the first role because of my body size. He needed someone big that can fight Joyce Kanu and I fitted into the character.\n\nWhich movie gave you the big break?\n\nAssembles of God and Ghetto University.\n\nMost men can hardly get their eyes off you; how do you cope with them?\n\nI end up making them my friends because we may end up doing businesses together. All my life I prefer making men my friends.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a male fan or admirer has done to you?\n\nOne of my male fans poured chocolate ice cream on me while trying to take picture with me. It was fun, but crazy.\n\nHow do you intend to break into the A-list in this highly competitive industry?\n\nI\u2019m focused on my talent; with God by my side, I know I will get to the top.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-married actress, what is your stand on divorce?\n\nBroken marriages have nothing to do with the movie industry, just pray God to keep your home. Marriages break up on daily basis not only in Nollywood.\n\nIs marriage far or near for you?\n\nI now want to focus on my career because my first marriage wasn\u2019t fun and I am not fully healed.\n\nHave you said no to marriage proposal?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve said no to many because I am not ready for marriage yet.\n\nNow, how would you safeguard your next marriage?\n\nI will do everything possible to keep my marriage when the time comes. Marriage is sweet when you marry your man, a man that will love and endure you as his queen, and you respect and submit to him as your king.\n\nWhat does sex mean to you?\n\nSex means nothing to me because I am not a sex freak. I can stay for five years without sex, as long as my business is doing well and my kids are happy.\n\nThere are women who cannot get their eyes off a sexy lady like you; do you also have women that woo you?\n\nYes, but I don\u2019t give room to that madness.\n\nAre you in a relationship now?\n\nI am not in any relationship for now. I am still very much single. I am a single mother.\n\nWhat are the qualities you desire in a man?\n\nHe must be handsome, God-fearing, humble, loving, caring, and well dressed.\n\nHow do you handle sexual urge especially now that you\u2019re not in any relationship?\n\nI am not a sex freak; the only thing that freaks me is money.\n\nDo you have men asking you to be their second wife?\n\nYes, many times, but I believe in one man, one wife.\n\nCan you marry a man much older than you?\n\nNo! I don\u2019t like old men. When I was much younger, I had a bad experience that made me not to give any old man a chance to my heart. So, I don\u2019t see myself marrying someone much older than me except It\u2019s the will of God.\n\nHow would you advise young people who want to go into acting?\n\nThey should be focused and consistent because acting needs a lot of time if you really want to make it in the movie business.",

          "title": "NDDC board: What Niger Delta people want Buhari to do to Akpabio \u2014Comrade Joseph Evah",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nNational leader, Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah has warned that unless something serious is done to salvage the present state of insecurity in the country, there may not be any election in 2023.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he also blamed the Southeast leaders for their latest culture of silence and fear as the major reason for the continued violence in the region.\n\nThe activist was also critical on the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s twitter handlers, as well as his lashes out the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, advocating for his sack.\n\nHe spoke on other national issues, including the recent constitution review exercise by the National Assembly with a verdict that nothing good will come out of it. Excerpt:\n\nLet\u2019s know the latest happening on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\n\nThe Niger Delta Ministry Minister, Godswill Akpabio is simply exhibiting madness, so we are following him up. He is the problem of NDDC, constituting stumbling block. Akpabio said we are frustrating them, he thought that NDDC is their political game centre so we are telling him that we have had enough of his arrogance. He went to Tompolo Gharamatu to go and beg him, he thought that Tompolo is someone that can be bribed because he believes that in Nigeria everybody has a price and bribable. No. Tompolo is not that type of person, he is one with credibility and integrity, that is why we have a lot of respect for him. What is the problem of Akpabio for not inaugurating the NDDC board? What is his problem? So, when he looks at the Niger Delta people he feels and thinks that he can put us in his pocket? When did he join politics? It is just like the way some of his former governor friends are behaving like drunkards. Look at the way some of them are behaving, common sense they don\u2019t have. It is disgracing. The problem is that most of them seem to forget their past, they forget where they are coming from and proscribed the memory of their past. In life anybody that forgets about his past when they get little opportunity you see them behaving like drunkards and you are going to leave the office one day, so why the arrogance? They seem to forget that power is transient, just temporary. When you leave the office is it not that same people you despised that you will meet again? Won\u2019t you come back for something else? We expect President Buhari to sack Akpabio quickly, if Akpabio will not face his Ministry of Niger Delta where there is no money to spend. But because of the type of money that the oil companies are giving to NDDC, Akpabio is focusing only on NDDC to build his own political jamboree in 2023, we will not allow it. The Ministry of Niger Delta is dead under Akpabio\u2019s watch, and he is not doing anything about it in Abuja. Because of the controversy in NDDC no money is going to NDDC from budgetary allocation. Akpabio is a confusionist and he should repent, but I expect the president to remove and replace him so that we can have peace. It is because of his gambling for 2023 that Akpabio is causing all this confusion.\n\nHow do you see the constitution review panels of the National Assembly?\n\nI do not see anything good or cheering coming out of it because our politicians are not sincere, if not for their insincerity and deceit something good should come out of it. Are they ready to let us have one chamber instead of this two chambers (House of Representatives and Senate) that we are wasting millions on? Which of them will be patriotic enough to say that this two chambers that we are operating, we are wasting so much money, that we should go back to our parliamentary system so as to save money? How many of the lawmakers are ready to sacrifice for their present positions now? They are ready for this wasteful system that is going on. I See what they are doing as mere jamboree because they are not sincere. Are you saying that they don\u2019t know our problem? Are you saying that they don\u2019t know that the system we are running is wasteful? But because they are benefitting from it themselves you will find out that they will not be genuinely committed to any serious review. Which of them will say: Let us go back to the parliamentary days, that we should have only one National Assembly, one chamber unlike this expensive nonsense we are practicing now. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are simply wasting money. Let us put that money in education. How many of them will suggest that? Let them start by examining themselves first. I don\u2019t see anything credible coming out of it and the reason as I said is simple. The people who are arranging it, managing it, midwifing it never won election in the first place, so they are alienated from their people. What the people want is not what they want. Can the National Assembly that we have today agree to go back to the parliamentary years so that we have one house (unicameral) making the law. Members of the National Assembly should start from themselves to get credibility and others will follow them and respect them. But for now, they are just wasting money, junketing the entire country, enjoying themselves in the hotels where they stay in the name of public hearing. I do not see any sincerity in what they are doing and I know I will be vindicated at last; nothing good will come out of it.\n\nWhat is your view on President Buhari\u2019s comment against the Southeast on Twitter, the removal of his tweet and the banning of Twitter in the country?\n\nI still think that our President\u2019s Twitter handlers should be more cautious on what they push out. You may find out that Buhari will not tweet such message on his own, sometimes the president is not aware of such tweets. There are many things they are doing in that Villa that the president is not aware of. His Twitter handlers need to exercise caution sometimes, seeing how the country is going volatile. There is need to manage any news, message, information coming from the presidential desk. I can tell you that the president was not aware of that tweet until his attention was drawn to it and they will start damage control. I think the president should caution those media aides that do those tweets with his name, they are taking so many things for granted, we should be sincere to ourselves. The president should caution those individuals who tweet things in his name that are not his ideology, individuals who create imaginary problems for him where there is none. The president I can tell you is not aware, I am not saying may not be aware, but that he was not aware of that tweet because he would not allow it. It is like what Akpabio is doing in the Niger Delta, he will just go and tell one of the personal assistants to the president that this is the thinking of the Niger Delta people and they will be pushing the agenda even without the president knowing. There is so mush deceit over there that a lot is outside the knowledge of Mr. President. They do not have access to the president\u2019s bedroom, but they know people who have such access, those are the people they go and lobby and they come out to say that the president said this and that when in truth the president is in the dark on those issues. Do you think President Buhari will tell the Attorney General to go and start comparing herdsmen with Igbo spare parts dealers? Can you imagine that logic in this 21st Century? If we are in a sane society that minister is supposed to resign. For that minister to open his mouth to compare bandits, herdsmen that are killing people, even in their own area, raping women among other atrocities and you compare them with spare parts dealers, such thinking is worrisome. When you see some of these things you begin to ask yourself, is this still the country that Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe etc, founded? Some of the things we hear and see these days about Nigeria are disturbing and you begin to ask yourself, how did we get here.\n\nI know you are aware of the massive support that former Lagos State governor and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is getting with the formation of SWAGA (Southwest Agenda for Asiwaju). What is your take on the development?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. They can go on with their massive support for him. He has the right to contest. I know a lot of people seem to be looking at the Southeast, but their political leaders and elders must rise up to the occasion of what is going on there now, the orgy of killings, the violence, destructions etc and stop it. What is going on in the Southeast is a signal, those who are sponsoring them are saying: Don\u2019t mention Southeast for the presidency in 2023, that is the signal. Those who are sponsoring destruction of police stations, burning of INEC offices, destruction of prisons, killing of policemen and other security agencies have a terrible agenda and the elders and political leaders in the Southeast are simply watching, keeping silent. This their new culture of silence and fear is not doing them any good. What are we saying? Are we saying that there is no leadership in the Southeast to stop this carnage, the self-destruction that is going on? Are you saying there is no political leadership and elders that can stop what is happening in the Southeast? When you are burning INEC offices and materials what will you use to conduct election? People that have committed crime and facing punishment you go and release them, why? I hope that the Southeast leaders should sit down and know that the signal is very clear and very dangerous for their political future. The Southeast leaders should investigate what is happening, the Yoruba are doing it. They should stop relying on conspiracy theory and folding their hands. Why can\u2019t they rise up to investigate what is happening? So, even if it is coming from the outside you fold your hands until the police do their investigation? No, they should open their eyes and track down what is happening, they should do their own thorough investigation too to compare with whatever other investigation that will be done either by the police or whoever. Igbo leaders have to arrest the situation, it is not something that they should wait for anybody to come and do for them. What is happening there is unacceptable. If there are saboteurs expose them, nobody will take any excuse on what is happening there because the Igbo must put their house in order. They must call a spade a spade, saying that outsiders are doing it, it is a fake cry, nobody will listen to such excuse; they have to unravel what is happening there. A political zone with not less than five states and the elders, governors, political leaders, senators cannot sit down and say: we must do something to stop this carnage. Even if what is happening is coming from the outside they can, with unity among them resist and stop it. You cannot be there and your environment, your heritage is being destroyed and you are talking of conspiracy theory, you are keeping silent. Are those people doing the destruction spirits? Igbo leadership must swing into action to unravel what is happening if they are serious. And they have the capacity to do it if they want to.\n\nBut you know that orders come from Abuja as far as security issues are concerned?\n\nSo, if Abuja did not respond or yet to respond you wait until you die waiting for Abuja? Look, every community in Nigeria has vigilante, every street has vigilante group, and wherever people are living they have a vigilante group. And we are aware even from reports from the social media of the vigilante in Igbo land which they are boasting off. If you go to Asaba area and see the vigilante group there you will fear, go to Delta North and see the powerful vigilante groups that people from Governor Okowa area has set up, beyond the Nigeria Police Force. In those areas people are contributing money from everywhere, from abroad, to sustain it for their security. Look, I am worried that if this security challenge remains this way there will be a big challenge with conducting any election. As I speak, you cannot travel from Bayelsa to Warri, you cannot travel to anywhere without being afraid, bandits are everywhere. I don\u2019t see the 2023 election taking place from the insecurity that is on now. Do you know the curfew that is in Rivers State? Rivers State is worse than Abia. We are praying that Rivers State problem does not extend to Bayelsa and the riverine areas. Poverty is coming, food is not moving round again because of the insecurity. As we speak now students are still in captivity. I am an educationist, why will I be happy to hear that children are still in captivity. In the house when I look at my daughter I imagine that somebody\u2019s daughter is still in captivity for one month. What is happening in the country is frightening. What are the Imams and the pastors telling our leaders who are members of their congregations? They should stop them from entering the mosques and churches. Let there be ushers on the ground that will be driving them away.",

          "title": "Anxiety as Nigeria\u2019s debt burden hits N32.9 trillion",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock currently pegged at N32.915 trillion (as at December 31, 2020), many are worried that the country is being boxed into a debt trap it may never wriggle out from in decades to come.\n\nThe figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to economic experts, plausible reasons for the swell in the external debts include lower oil prices, disproportionate spending, COVID-19, defence of the exchange rate, over-reliance on crude oil receipts (with all its volatilities) and poor economic diversification agenda, among others.\n\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\n\nThis period corresponds with the Presidency of Buhari, who assumed leadership of the country on May 29, 2015.\n\nAccording to the statistics, Nigeria\u2019s total debt as at June 30, 2015 stood at N12.12 trillion.\n\nHowever, by December 31, 2020, the country\u2019s debt portfolio had risen to N32.92 trillion.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s debt was N12.6 trillion. It rose to N17.4 trillion in 2016 and then N21.7 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s debt had climbed to N24.4 trillion. It ballooned to N27.1 in 2019 and finally N32.915 trillion as at December 31 last year.\n\nThis shows that within a period of 66 months (five and half years), the country\u2019s debt grew by N20.8 trillion.\n\nIt also means that within the period, the country\u2019s debt portfolio rose by 171.62 per cent.\n\nDomestic sources accounted for N20.21 trillion, while external sources accounted for N12.71 trillion.\n\nIn percentage terms, external debts accounted for 38.6 per cent of the total debt portfolio while domestic debts accounted for 61.4 per cent.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\n\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\n\nWhile servicing local debts gulped N8.53 trillion between July 2015 and December 2020, servicing external debts gulped N1.72 trillion from 2016 to December 2020 (external debt servicing converted to naira at the exchange rate prevailing at the time, provided by the DMO).\n\nThe data provided by the DMO showed that from July to December 2015, N489.59 billion was spent on servicing local debts.\n\nFrom January to December, a total of N1.23 trillion was spent to service the country\u2019s domestic debts in 2016. The figure rose to N1.48 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s domestic debt servicing bill rose to N1.8 trillion. The cost of domestic debt servicing came down a bit in 2019 to N1.69 trillion. In 2020, it rose again to N1.85 trillion.\n\nOn the other hand, external debt servicing consumed $353.09 million in 2016. It went up to $464.05 million in 2017 and jumped up to $1.47 billion in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the nation spent $1.33 billion on external debt servicing. In 2020, external debt servicing gulped $1.56 billion.\n\nTo rescue the country from the thorny situation, President Buhari has been going cap in hand begging for debt relief for the country at different international fora, but without success thus far.\n\nHis efforts mimic those of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in 2006, when she led Nigeria and the Paris Club to seal a final agreement for debt relief worth $18 billion and an overall reduction of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock by $30 billion.\n\nOn his part, the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele has called on the state governors to wean themselves off the addiction to loans and monthly federal subvention by investing heavily in agriculture, especially in crops they have comparative advantage. With that, they can help solve the food insecurity nightmare and go into massive exports to pay their debts and build prosperity for their respective states.\n\nThe rise in the country\u2019s debt servicing reflected the nation\u2019s increasing commitment to external loans.\n\nThe debt accumulation is coming at a time when key government officials in the Economic Management Team have repeatedly defended the country\u2019s debt level, arguing that it is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has severally insisted that Nigeria does not have a debt problem.\n\nAccording to her, what the government needed to do was to increase its revenue generating capacity in order to boost revenue to about 50 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cNigeria does not have a debt problem. What we have is a revenue problem.\n\n\u201cOur revenue to GDP is still one of the lowest among countries that are comparable to us. It\u2019s about 19 per cent of GDP and what the World Bank and IMF recommended is about 50 per cent of GDP for countries that are our size. We are not there yet. What we have is a revenue problem\u201d, she posited at a recent Finance Summit.\n\nHowever, the Finance Minister\u2019s position differs with that of some economic experts who said that the huge borrowings portend danger for the economy.\n\nFor instance, a Chartered Accountant, Mr Ezekiel Ifeanyi said the Federal Government\u2019s current fiscal position constrains it from embarking on such huge expenditure as a result of accumulated large deficits over the past few years.\n\nHe said that the huge debt remains a burden for the economy, adding that time has come for Nigeria to begin to seek debt relief from its creditors.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\n\u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escaping from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn\u201d, Ezekiel stated.\n\nAlso, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, at a virtual conference organised by Elombah Television in 2020, warned that with the rise in the country\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio, Nigeria was heading towards a sovereign debt crisis.\n\nHe noted that the terms and conditions attached to the Chinese loans were not favourable to Nigeria.\n\nThe former presidential candidate canvassed public private partnership (PPP) as the best and sustainable way to fund strategic infrastructure projects.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one problem is not just Nigeria\u2019s loan to China, but it is the broader external indebtedness. Nigeria is essentially walking into a sovereign debt crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that we now spend virtually all that we earn servicing foreign debt.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Government\u2019s total revenue was about N950 billion, but we spent N943 billion servicing external debt, which was about 99 per cent. Is a country on this path fiscally viable?\n\n\u201cWe are taking more and more of these loans and we are told by the Debt Management Office (DMO) that our debt to GDP ratio is under control and is below 30 per cent, and that it does not matter.\u201d\n\nHe explained that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s revenue \u201cis from crude oil. So, when those revenues are plunging, then that is a huge risk because your debt obligations are fixed.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is such a serious mismatch between what you are earning and what you have to pay those you are owing, then you have a crisis. And that is the real problem for Nigeria today with its loan from China.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nigeria\u2019s lenders are offshore corporations, with China being Nigeria\u2019s biggest creditor.\n\nNigeria has agreed $5.6 billion in loans with China. But as of March 2020, Beijing had disbursed $3.3 billion. With Nigeria already servicing the loans, $3.1 billion was outstanding as at then.\n\nHowever, commenting on the rising debt, the DMO explained that it was not an entirely gloomy situation. It noted that after Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of new borrowing at the federal level, as shown in the annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the government\u2019s measures to moderate the rate of growth in the public debt stock in order to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nThe DMO added that new borrowing to part-finance budget deficits had declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018. It was N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThis trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as new borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 trillion. Many countries including the advanced countries also increased their level of borrowing as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted though, that apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund ($3.34 billion) and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\n\u201cThis incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 budget and the additional issuance of promissory notes to settle some arrears of the Federal Government of Nigeria, contributed to the increase in public debt stock. New domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.\n\n\u201cTotal public debt to GDP as at December 31, 2020 was 21.61 per cent which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40 per cent. The various initiatives of the government to increase revenues such as the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative and the Finance Act, 2020, should help shore up government\u2019s revenue and reduce the debt service to revenue ratio\u201d, the DMO explained.\n\nBut amid fears of Nigeria\u2019s high debt exposure to China, the DMO reassured that there was nothing to panic about as the loans were concessional with interest rates of 2.50 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and a moratorium of seven years.\n\nIt added that the communist country was not a major source of funding for the Federal Government, despite the fact that total borrowing from China, as at March 31, 2020, stood at $3.121 billion or N1,126.68 trillion using the N361/$1 conversion template.\n\nThe DMO ruled out the possibility of China taking possession of the projects financed by them if Nigeria defaults in servicing the loan.\n\nThe DMO emphasized that Nigeria explicitly provides for debt service on its external and domestic debt in its annual budgets, adding that a number of the projects being (and to be) financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue.\n\nIt added that the $3.121 billion Chinese debt represents only 3.94 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total public debt of $79.303 billion (N28,628.49 trillion at $1/N361) as at March 31, 2020.\n\nDMO said: \u201cSimilarly, in terms of external sources of funds, loans from China accounted for 11.28 per cent of the external debt stock of $27.67 billion at the same date.\n\n\u201cThese data show that China is not a major source of funding for the Nigerian government.\n\nThe terms of the loans are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. In addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to the government, while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\n\u201cThese two benefits make the provisions for debt service in the annual budget lower than they would otherwise have been if the loans were on commercial terms\u201d.\n\nThe DMO further explained that the $3.121 billion Chinese loans are project-tied facilities.\n\nIt listed the 11 projects as; Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail Project, Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion Project, (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) and Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja \u2013 Keffi- Makurdi Road Project.\n\nIt further noted that the impact of these loans is not only evident but visible. For instance, the Idu \u2013 Kaduna rail line has become a major source of transportation between Abuja and Kaduna. Also, the new International Airport in Abuja, has improved air transportation for the populace, while the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan rail line when completed, will ease traffic on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\n\u201cThe projects also have the added benefits of job creation, not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers, a number of which are Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development. Using Loans from China to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position.\n\n\u201cThe principal process and requirements for borrowing by the government are expressly stated in the Debt Management Office Establishment (ETC) Act, 2003 (DMO Act) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. Section 21 (1) of the DMO Act, \u2018No External loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution\u2019 and Section 41 (1a) of the FRA, \u2018Government at all tiers shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development, provided that, such borrowing shall be on concessional terms with low interest rate and with a reasonable long amortization period subject to the approval of the appropriate legislative body where necessary\u2019, are instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning works with the MDAs under whose portfolio a proposed loan falls and also with the DMO. Thereafter, the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) is sought. It is only after the approval by FEC that His Excellency requests for the approval of the National Assembly as required by Section 41 of the Fiscal responsibility Act, 2007. More importantly, it is only after the approval of NASS that the loans are taken and Nigeria begins to draw down on the loans.\n\n\u201cThe loan agreements are reviewed by legal officers of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the Legal Opinion of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is obtained before any External Loan Agreement is signed\u201d, the DMO added.\n\nCommenting on Nigeria\u2019s ballooning debt profile, Nigeria\u2019s first professor of the Capital Markets and former Imo State Finance Commissioner, Prof Uche Uwaleke explained that the crash in revenue generation always leads the Nigerian government to borrow.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to make conscious efforts to have multiple streams of income, including through embracing the private sector to develop the enabling environment for this to happen. The economy has remained vulnerable to external shocks due to inability to hugely diversify revenue sources.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the economy went into recession twice since 2015 owing in part to fall in crude oil prices and the forex challenge that came with the two cycles.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, there is no evidence to suggest that the bulk of the borrowing has gone into self-liquidating capital projects. A major cause of naira depreciation is the huge forex spent importing petroleum products in a period of rising crude oil prices. The huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.\n\n\u201cThe lasting solution is to create multiple sources of forex via export diversification and to curtail demand through import substitution and patronizing locally made products\u201d, he stated.\n\nBut the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said at a recent Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria 2021 Fellow Conferment ceremony in Lagos, that Nigeria was adopting the best practices of sustainable debt management.\n\nAccording to him, the repayment plan of the debt is tied to the projects for which the loan is taken.\n\nThe presidential aide noted that \u201call the terms and conditions of the loans are laid before the National Assembly and approved in detail before execution.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid the terms being approved by the National Assembly after the loan agreement must have been executed. A number of projects being and to be financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue\u201d.\n\nThe above assertion notwithstanding, experts insist there is a need for Nigeria to build revenue to have more space to spend for infrastructure, social safety nets and others. This is to avoid interest on the loans eating up the bulk of the revenue.",
          "summary": "The figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\nThe huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, this year, Nigeria took delivery of four million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said to be the first batch of expected vaccines, preparatory to vaccination exercise in Nigeria.\n\nThis was after several \u201cdelays\u201d and shift in arrival date, perhaps due to failed logistics arrangements or other unforeseen circumstances that elongated the arrival of the vaccines.\n\nGAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with the help UNICEF was said to had faciliated the procurement and shipping of the vaccine.\n\nOn Friday, March 5, the vaccination exercise was flagged off in Abuja. This was after the National Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had certified the vaccine safe for use.\n\nA brief ceremony to herald the commencement of the exercise was held at the Trauma Centre, National Hospital, Abuja, with impressive representation of the officials of the Federal Government and other stakeholders.\n\nAt about 11:05 a.m, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, a family physician, Senior Registrar at National Hospital, Abuja, was administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, marking the historic commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, administered the vaccine to Dr. Ngong, who was deeply appreciated for giving his best professionally to COVID-19 patients at one of the isolation centres in Abuja.\n\nThereafter, vaccination began across the states. Several parameters were used to distribute the vaccines to states, and that include adequate maintenance of cold chain storage facilities, transportation of logistics to the ward/ health facility, adequate security during transportation and at vaccination sites, completion of training of health workers, efficient social mobilization activities in place, as well as adherence to protocol for vaccine deployment.\n\nData from the national call-in dash board domiciled at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) indicated that as at June 6, when the administration of the first dose of vaccines ended, 1,966,128 million persons were vaccinated. Lagos State led with 313, 433 persons vaccinated. FCT, Kano and Kaduna states followed with 132,483; 95,963; 92,999 people vaccinated, respectively.\n\nData, however, obtained from the NPHCDA indicated that second dose of the vaccination begun immediately, after about four months.\n\nAs at June 6, data from NPHCDA vaccination dash board indicated that 336,501 had received their second jab.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s fear and anxiety on the ability of the vaccines reaching clients before its expiration.\n\nThere are indications that millions of doses of the vaccine in the first batch of consignment will expire in few weeks, precisely, June 28 and July 9, respectively.\n\nNPHCDA Executive Director, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, was quoted to have confirmed at the National media briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 recently that the AstraZeneca vaccine will expire soon\n\nHe said: \u201cThe batches of AstraZeneca we received some months ago have expiring dates of June and July, respectively. Howbeit, vaccination again is ongoing in all states of the federation. Our collaboration with health officials and other stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels in the vaccination exercise has yielded substantial results.\u201d\n\nHe also said there would be delay in the arrival of another consignment of the vaccines which may also affect and impact the remaining phases of the vaccination campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, a credible source at the PSC hinted that procurement of another batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not in the plan of the Federal Government, rather the government is considering Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine because of cost, storage facilities and other unique features.\n\nRecall that NAFDAC, few weeks ago, confirmed J&J COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria, after a report by its vaccine committee confirmed that data on the vaccine were robust and met criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.\n\nNAFDAC boss, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, had noted that most commonly reported side effects of the J&J vaccine are pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea, and most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last for one to two days.\n\nShe said the data also showed that the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks thereby supporting the manufacturer\u2019s recommended use.\n\nShe confirmed that the J&J vaccine is administered as a single dose as against the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that is administered twice to confirm its efficacy, adding that the results from a clinical trial involving people in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries found that the vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe phase III clinical trial involved over 44,000 people. Half of them received a single dose of the vaccine and half were given placebo (a dummy injection). Many of them did not know if they were given J&J COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\n\n\u201cThe trial found a 67 per cent reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received J&J COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe explained that J&J COVID-19 vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19, and an unopened vaccine vials can be stored and/or transported frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C for up to 24 months and three months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ngong, who was the first to take AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said that he took the second dose of the vaccine after 10 weeks, and he had no reaction.",

          "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has lost his 12-year hold on power in Israel after the country\u2019s parliament voted in a new coalition government.\n\nA new \u201cgovernment of change\u201d will be led by right-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party.\n\nHe will lead an unprecedented coalition of parties which was approved with a razor-thin majority vote of 60-59.\n\nMr Bennett will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal.\n\nHe will hand power over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years. Speaking in the Knesset debate, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s our destiny to be in the opposition, we\u2019ll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government, and return to lead the country our way.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr Bennett, who leads Yamina, thanked Mr Netanyahu for his service to the country and pledged never to allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nWhy has this happened?\n\nMr Netanyahu has served a record-breaking five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021.\n\nHe called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more elections followed, each of which ended inconclusively.\n\nThe third election resulted in a government of national unity where Mr Netanyahu agreed to share power with the then-opposition leader Benny Gantz. But the arrangement collapsed in December, triggering a fourth election.\n\nAlthough Likud emerged as the largest party in the 120-seat Knesset, Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a governing coalition and the task was handed to Mr Lapid, whose centrist Yesh Atid party had emerged as the second largest.\n\nOpposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina.\n\nAlthough Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical if any potential coalition government was to have a majority in parliament. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office.\n\nThe agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s fate.\n\nWhat will the new government be like?\n\nIn appearance, Mr Bennett\u2019s government will be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel\u2019s 73-year history.\n\nThe alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of eight female ministers.\n\nThe inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians \u2013 Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance.\n\nThere could also be difficulties over social policies \u2013 while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this.\n\nIn addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina \u2013 a national-religious party \u2013 will likely allow.\n\nMr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters.\n\n\u201cNobody will have to give up their ideology,\u201d he recently said, \u201cbut all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams\u2026 We\u2019ll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot.\u201d (BBC)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Explains N\u2019Assembly has power to give Nigeria a new constitution\n\n\u2022Posits an amendment includes substitution\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi and Victor Olakitan in Ado-Ekiti\n\nA renowned Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and founder, Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), Chief Afe Babalola, has said the current state of the nation presents a democracy with a paralysed legislature and judiciary, thus defeating the very essence of democracy as the most viable system of government.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the legal luminary and businessman, who reckoned that Nigeria was yet to have an ideal democracy given that scenario, argued that the National Assembly has the power to give Nigeria a brand new constitution contrary to the position of NASS leadership. \u201cLet me say that it was totally wrong for the National Assembly to say they cannot produce or write a new constitution. Under the 1999 Constitution, the National Assembly can produce a new constitution. One, the 1999 Constitution gave the National Assembly the power to amend. In its broad interpretation, an amendment includes substitution.\n\nThey can exercise their powers and say the 1999 Constitution needs a substitution. They gave a narrow interpretation to the amendment clause. This same process was undertaken in Sudan and many other countries. All the National Assembly needed to do is to call for a conference where people will advise on where and how the 1999 constitution can be substituted. That is all.\u201d\n\nBabalola also spoke on the recent Twitter row with the federal government, and posited that President Muhammadu Buhari erred by his decision to suspend the operations of the microblogging giant in the country.\n\nAnswering to a question on the autonomy of the judiciary, which had prompted a strike by judicial workers for over two months, Babalola said, \u201cDemocracy thrives on three fundamentals pillars \u2013 the executive, legislature and judiciary. If a man with two legs has one of its legs cut off, will he be able to move freely?\n\n\u201cBut out of the three arms we have, two have been paralysed. I mean the legislature and judiciary. Do we now say we have a democracy? Where can people ventilate their anger? Do they want them to resort to self-help? There can be no fairness and justice, where the executive continues to pay those in the judiciary.\u201d\n\nSupporting his claims, the Ekiti-born lawyer, noted: \u201cI have been in the legal practice for 60 years or thereabouts. I knew how our courts were when I came back to the country from England in the early 60s. Then, we had lawyers from Ghana, West Indies and many other countries competing with us in the Nigerian courts. So, it was very competitive. In my 60 years of practice, however, Nigerian courts have never been shut for a day. Even in those days, lawyers and judges were respected.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the aphorism that says he who pays the piper dictates the tune. Commonsense dictates that there should be independence for legislature and judiciary. If the car of a judge breaks down and he only relies on a president or governor to get it fixed, then, it will be difficult for him to pass a judgment that will be against the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the process of recruiting members of the Bench in Nigeria, he said,\n\n\u201cThat is critical. But we have not got it right. A practice, whereby people are asked to apply to become a judge, is affecting the system. The process cannot guarantee fairness and justice. After filing the application, the governor will now decide, who to pick among them. In those days, people did not need to apply to become judges.\n\n\u201cIt is the system itself that looks for qualified men of integrity to become judges. That is part of the rot in our system. I believe that the judiciary must not only be autonomous, but also the courts must be accessible and open to all. The president and governors, as high as they are, are equal before the courts. That is the beauty of it.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria, Babalola said, \u201cI do not believe the president was right to have given the directive just because Twitter removed his post about the security in the Southeast. Don\u2019t forget that the English law we are operating presumes that you are innocent until the court proves otherwise.\n\n\u201cTwitter, like human beings, has the right to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account in this context. The president cannot be a judge in his own case. If he felt wronged by what Twitter did, what he ought to have done is to approach the court of law, which has power of adjudication. He cannot jail Twitter for removing his comment. Only the court has such powers and not the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nNigerians yesterday staged protests and rallies around the country to mark the second anniversary of declaration June 12 as Democracy Day and protest the state of affairs in the country.\n\nAnd in what has been widely condemned as double standard, the Nigeria Police, yesterday, protected and permitted pro-President Muhammadu Buhari campaigners to hold a solidarity rally in Abuja without any form of harassment, while at the same time disrupting the rallies organised by anti-Buhari groups in many parts of the country, using teargas.\n\nA mega rally organised for the president by his supporters, who trooped to Unity Fountain in Maitama, Abuja, to celebrate Democracy Day, was populated by dozens of youths drawn from the Youth Coalition for Development (YCD). They closed a section of the Shehu Shagari Road to traffic.\n\nInterestingly, there was heavy security in place, including a helicopter, which hovered above to protect those at the rally convened by Aminu Aminu.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the riotous atmosphere at the Gudu area of Abuja, where activists, led by Omoyele Sowore, who were opposed to the Buhari administration, clashed with policemen who were sent to disperse them with teargas. The police also dispersed anti-Buhari marchers in other parts of the country, like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abeokuta,\n\nBut the Federal Capital Territory Police Command justified its decision to disperse the anti-government protesters.\n\nMany of those who showed up for the solidarity procession for the president were clad in branded white T-shirts with the inscription, \u201cI Stand With Buhari, How about You?\u201d boldly on the shirts. They also held placards bearing messages, like \u201c#IStandwithBuhari\u201d, \u201cWe are Indivisible\u201d, \u201cWe stay as one, We are Nigeria!\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s supporters also carried a declarative message that read: \u201cProtest is only about getting your voice heard not a means of changing the government\u201d.\n\nSpeaking with reporters at the rally, the organiser said the solidarity march was put together in recognition of the efforts of many people, who campaigned and laboured to institute a culture of democracy in the country since 1993. He lauded Buhari for recognising the importance of the day.\n\nAminu said, \u201cJune 12 is a watershed in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s democratic history. It is a day to celebrate the beginning of a consistent and ideological struggle that eventually gave birth to a foundation for the democratic renaissance Nigeria is now building.\u201d\n\nBut, earlier, the police teargased a group protesting at the Gudu area of the Federal Capital Territory. Sowore, the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, led the protesters comprising many youths and middle-aged persons. They said they were gathered to protest against the prevailing insecurity in the country.\n\nThe anti-Buhari rally began about 8.30am and was peaceful until the police stormed the area and started firing teargas to disperse the rally. The Gudu road was also cordoned off while traffic flow was disrupted as a result.\n\nThe development forced the protesters, who carried placards bearing inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari must go\u201d, \u201cSay no to injustice\u201d, \u201c33.3% Unemployment Rate is Criminal\u201d, \u201d Digital Right is Human Right\u201d, to scamper to safety.\n\nThe FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, in a statement said policemen had to disperse the protesters to prevent members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others from \u201cinciting public disturbance.\u201d Mariam added that calm had been restored around the axis and said nobody was arrested.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cFCT Police foils attempt to incite public disturbance, disperse members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others\u201d, Mariam stated, \u201cThe FCT Police Command on Saturday, June 12, 2021, successfully restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after professionally dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria \u2013 Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents. However, no arrest was made.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the command wishes to state that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\u201d\n\nIn Yola, the Adamawa State capital, residents staged a protest and demanded a revolution to change the present leadership of Buhari, citing incompetence in handing the country\u2019s affairs. The protesters, who came under the banner of #Buharimustgo, defied a heavy rainfall and continued their protest for about three hours, demanding good governance and a leader who would pull Nigeria out of its numerous challenges. They also called on Buhairi to relinquish power, brandishing banners of #revolutionnow, which asked Buhari to quit immediately.\n\nSporting black T-shirts marked with inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d, the protesters chanted, \u201cFreedom comes by struggle\u201d and maintained, \u201cwe must come together to salvage our nation\u201d.\n\nLeader of the group, Tony Sudan Gompwel, told journalists that Buhari and other political leaders had failed the country.\n\nGompwel stated, \u201cThe kind of political leaders we have in our nation cannot give us the desired change.\u201d He said bad leadership was the reason the country was bedevilled by insecurity and economic backwardness.\n\n\u201cThey are hardened, they are tyrants, they are bankrupt of ideas. That\u2019s why great Nigerian youths are converging all over the nation to demand that they should leave the stage,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHowever, while the protest against the Buhari administration subsisted, his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Adamawa State read out Buhari\u2019s scorecard to residents to mark the second year of designating June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who was represented by Honourable Abdulrazask Namdas, commended the Buhari administration. Namdas, a member representing Jada, Ganye, Toungo and Mayobelwa Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, said the celebration was also to intimate the citizens of the performance of the APC in the state.\n\nAt the event held at Muna Hotel, Yola, to mark the June 12 celebration, the scorecards of all serving senators and House of Representatives members from the state, and that of Buhari, were read out.\n\nAdamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri praised the courage and desire of the citizenry to allow democracy thrive after two decades of uninterrupted process.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his Press Secretary, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou, commended the electorate for trusting him with their mandate.\n\nThe governor said in the release, \u201cWe will continue to ensure we keep to our promise \u2013 a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our values of opportunity, responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their lives in a difficult period made worse by the dwindling economic hardship.\n\n\u201cOur desire to strengthen democracy and give it its true meaning informed the investment we are making in the social reengineering of the state through the provision of infrastructure and human capital development needed to unlock the growth and development of the Adamawa of our dream. The projects spread across the state represent the value and meaning of Democracy Day.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, it was quiet in most parts of the state even though there were reports of skirmishes between protesters and men of the Nigerian Police at the Gani Fawehinmi Park at Ojota.\n\nAt the Mile Two area of the state also, there were reports of violent confrontations, which were promptly quelled by security operatives.\n\nHowever, all was peaceful in known flashpoints in the state, like Oshodi, Ojodu-Berger, Ojuelegba, Fagba, and Ketu, as many residents celebrated the June 12 Democracy Day in their homes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that although the protesters at Gani Fawehinmi Park were peaceful initially, it was the attempt by the police to forcibly disperse them from the venue that resulted in a face-off, leading to the use of teargas by the police. There were no reports of casualties or injuries.\n\nThere were no reports of breakdown of law and order in any other part of the state, even though many businesses were closed.\n\nIn Iju, Agege, Ojodu, Ikeja, Abule Egba, and Ogba areas, many people were indoors as commercial buses also stayed off roads.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that security was normal in most of these places, as no policemen and other security agents were noticed on the streets, and traffic was light.\n\nSpeaking on the conduct of the police, human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, said even though he had to go and effect the release of some youths arrested by the police, he was glad that there were no reports of killings. He said the situation was remarkably better than the previous months.\n\nFalana alleged that last year, the Nigeria Police had no canister of teargas to quell protests, hence their resort to the use of live bullets, as happened during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nFalana, who spoke at the 25th Anti-Corruption Situation Room organised by the Heda Resources Centre, disclosed that it was the lack of the teargas canisters that led to the killing of 99 persons during the October 2020 protest.\n\nIn Edo State, protesters called on the federal government to deliver good governance and adequate security, stating that the ineptitude of Buhari has brought Nigeria to its knees. The protesters, who began their match at King Square (Ring Road), Benin City, were provided security by the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and the state vigilante group. They accompanied the protesters to the Government House, where the Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu, received them.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of about seven groups of protesters and civil society organisations, Marxist Kola Edokpayi of the Talakawa Assembly, lamented that the nonchalant attitude of the president towards security of life and property had brought the country to its present unacceptable situation.\n\nEdokpayi said, \u201cThe ineptitude of President Buhari has brought us to this sorry state. His nonchalant attitude has caused a lot of security problems. It has been difficult to combat Boko Haram, banditry and kidnapping. Nigerians now live in fear and nobody knows what will happen next.\n\n\u201cWhat we now hear is \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 who are killing people in the South-east, while other parts of the country are becoming unsafe to live in because of insecurity. The prices of goods and services are moving up daily beyond the reach of the common man.\u201d\n\nResponding, the deputy governor commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully and promised that all their grievances would be channelled to the right quarters.\n\nShaibu used the opportunity to speak on some political issues in the state. He said of the 14 state lawmakers whose seats were declared vacant, \u201cWe did everything possible to have them in the House but they decided to follow a godfather, who misled them. Even with a month until their seats would be declared vacant, we urged them to join the assembly but they were asking for a second proclamation.\n\n\u201cThey also went to court and that had stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting a fresh election. The INEC has said no new election can be conducted until the cases are decided. So, we have to wait for the courts before the next move can be made.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, governors and prominent Nigerians across the country, yesterday, spoke on the second anniversary of June 12 as Democracy Day, focusing on the swirling frustrations in different parts of the country.\n\nKWARA\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State says the country has made progress despite its current challenges, which include the challenges of nation building, population bulge, and insecurity. In a statement issued in Ilorin on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, to commemorate June 12, the governor said, \u201cI felicitate with Kwarans, and, indeed, all Nigerians, on this day of June 12, which has come to symbolise the struggle of our people for human rights, participatory democracy, and development.\n\n\u201cWhatever the challenges of nation-building confronting our fatherland, the truth is that we are pacing ahead in all indices of development while institutions of democracy are growing stronger and getting more mature.\u201d\n\nGOMBE\n\nThe Gombe State governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, yesterday, praised Nigerians for resolving to maintain democracy as the means of governance, saying 22 years of interrupted democratic rule has proven naysayers wrong. Yahaya said Nigeria\u2019s \u201cdemocratic maturity has shattered the myths about African democracy being under the grip of one single leader or political party.\u201d\n\nHe noted that as the largest country in Africa, Nigeria would continue to hold the torch of nation building, democratic pluralism, and political stability in Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of uninterrupted democracy, I make bold to say Nigeria\u2019s democracy has come of age. We have witnessed successful transitions of power from one administration to the next, and from one political party to another,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nBAUCHI\n\nBauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, saluted the courage and patriotism of all democrats \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 who strived to ensure that democracy was well grounded in the country.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the governor said, \u201cWe laboured together to arrive where we are today and we shall continue to march the state forward to greatness with determination and sincerity of purpose with your support and prayers.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who explained that his two-year journey in power had not been a bed of roses, added, \u201cBut with determination and the support enjoyed from the good people of the state, we were able to pilot the affairs of government to a sound socio-political pedestal.\u201d\n\nEKITI\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, urged Nigerians to be more determined in ensuring that democracy worked in the country. Fayemi said despite its imperfections, democracy remained the best option for the country, adding that through the determination of the citizens and their active participation in the democratic process, Nigerians can achieve a truly great country of their dream.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to relent in their search for lasting peace as a necessary condition for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe governor saluted the heroic deeds of patriots, who worked assiduously to actualise democratic rule in the country, especially, the symbol of the June 12 struggle, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, saying only a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria can be a befitting compensation for their sacrifices\n\n\u201cWe may not have reached the promised land, but we have left Egypt. We may not have attained the best, but we surely have made some progress as a nation,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nABIOLA\u2019S DAUGHTER\n\nHafsat Abiola-Costello, one of the daughters of the presumed winner of the June 12 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola, said her family would not forget the role played by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, in ensuring that their late patriarch was immortalised for his contribution to democracy. Abiola-Costello also praised the minister for his role in the renaming of Kudirat Abiola Road, in memory of her mother, who was brutally murdered during her struggles to regain the stolen mandate of her husband.\n\nShe said long before President Muhammadu Buhari came in as president, Aregbesola, who was then governor of Osun State, had embarked on a one-man campaign to press for recognition of Abiola as winner of the 1993 election and, indeed, to be recognised as a former president.\n\nOGUN\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun said the best way for Nigerians to immortalise and celebrate the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola, and June 12, was to build bridges and demolish sectarian fences. Abiodun stated this on Saturday in his speech at the 2021 Democracy Day celebration, held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nThe governor, who said Nigerians could not afford to bring down the country or despair in its future, noted that the supreme price paid by the Abiola and his mandate should serve as a reminder that Nigerians were stronger together as a nation.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigerians embrace the essence of the MKO persona, internalise belief in self, faith in a united country and other initiatives that help to engender a sense of shared heritage amongst Nigerian people, we will continue to be a country in search of nationhood,\u201d he said.\n\nAbiodun urged Nigerians to push all the negative and divisive forces and policies on the back-foot and embrace the symbolism of June 12, saying, \u201cLet us join hands to make Nigeria work for all Nigerians. June 12 represents what will strengthen the country\u2019s unity, indivisibility and oneness.\u201d He added that such unity would end all quests for self-determination and other sectarian agitations, as well as calm frayed nerves.\n\nBAYELSA\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, expressed his administration\u2019s determination to change the development narrative of the state. Diri spoke on Saturday at Government House, Yenagoa, during his maiden media chat that was broadcast live on all Yenagoa-based radio stations.\n\nThe media interaction was part of activities to commemorate this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nThe governor, in a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said democracy was about the people and Nigeria had come a long way with 22 years of uninterrupted civil rule, which he said had not been smooth but worth celebrating.\n\nHe noted that the urban renewal programme and other projects and policies of his administration were part of the drive to give the state a new look and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nDiri said the state had a lot of tourism potential and the government was open to discussion and ready to sign memorandum of understanding with partners to develop projects in the sector.\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s infrastructure development refund to the state, the governor clarified that the actual amount it received was N27.5 billion and not N38.4 billion, as being speculated in some quarters.\n\nHe explained that though the total refund due the state was N38.4 billion, according to the federal government, its release would not be possible in the next four years. He said the state was offered a second option of a discounted amount of N27.5 billion through the Debt Management Office, which it got last December.\n\nResponding to a question on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent directive to revive cattle grazing routes across the country, Diri said there were no such routes in the state. He explained that although he was not countering the federal government\u2019s decision to resuscitate grazing routes, his administration had put in place a legal framework to ban open grazing and movement of cattle on foot.\n\nThe Bayelsa governor also emphasised that the southern governors had adopted the same position on the issue as part of measures to check farmers/herders clashes across the country.\n\nDiri maintained that his government could not afford to expose its citizenry to the looming danger.\n\nKADUNA CAN\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said June 12 could not be celebrated as Democracy Day because Nigerian leaders were not democratic. Hayab said Nigerians could not be governed by intimidation and still celebrate June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY on Saturday, Hayab said in a true democracy, there was rule of law and freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to him, June 12 is merely a date set aside by the government, though there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating.\n\nHayab stated, \u201cWe are simply celebrating a date set aside by the government but there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating. The spirit behind June 12 is supposed to make our current leaders truly democratic but what we see is governance by intimidation and creating fear in the minds of citizens.\n\n\u201cA true sign of democracy is the freedom citizens enjoy and respect for the rule of law, which is visibly absent in the way we have been governed in this country. I wish the government should have remembered that in a few days or in the second week of June. We will have this day to be reminded to celebrate before announcing the ban on Twitter and many uncomplimentary comments about other regions by the president.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom said he was not against Buhari as a person but often disagreed with him on the constitutionality of issues and policy. Ortom said those who insinuated that his disagreement with the president was bone out of hatred were wrong. He stated that the attack on him would not force his administration to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in the state.\n\nThe governor declared that anyone who thought the state government would be intimidated to repeal the law was making a great mistake. He said his administration was trying to amend the law to increase the penalties against anyone who flouted it.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Makurdi, while giving his midterm scorecard as part of activities marking this year\u2019s Democracy Day, Ortom said, \u201cI have always prayed and supported the president but when it comes to issues of fairness and illegality, I will disagree.\n\n\u201cThe law on ranching has come to stay and no amount of intimidation can make us to repeal it. Instead, we will soon amend the law in order to increase the penalties against offenders.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who listed his administration\u2019s achievements in the areas of education, agriculture, infrastructure, and health, among others, lamented the humanitarian situation caused by the continued attacks by armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in Benue communities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe security threat from armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in our communities has resulted in wanton killings and the displacement of people in large numbers across the state.\n\n\u201cToday, Benue State has over one million IDPs with many of them living in the camps we have set up and others staying with their relations. The situation has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the huge sums of money his administration had been spending to cater for the Internally displaced persons, resources were always inadequate because the number of IDPs increased daily.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cMy desire is to ensure that the IDPs return to their ancestral homes. Most of them are farmers, and the longer they stay in the camps, the more food production is affected. We hope that the federal government will also fulfil its promise to assist Benue and other states in the North-central, which have been badly affected by the attacks to resettle the victims.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that many of his colleagues had been coming around to encourage him on his stand to hold the presidency accountable over insecurity in the country but were too afraid to talk.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our prayer is that we collectively turn to Him in repentance so that He admits us for Hajj in the coming years,\u201d NAHCON said.\n\nNAHCON\u2019s Chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, the statement claimed, commended the resilience of Nigerian intending pilgrims and the support they had exhibited during the long and tortuous wait, including their adherence to each instruction given by the Commission and the total compliance in receiving Covid-19 jab with the hope of performing the 2021 Hajj.\n\nNAHCON, however, added that as in the previous year, the pilgrims seeking refund of their Hajj deposits would be granted such without unnecessary delay.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Adeniyi of the High Court of Justice, Abuja Division, seeking among others, the nullification of the March Congresses (1st defendant, PDP) to the extant list of already inaugurated party officers and delegates that emerged \u201cfrom the Anambra PDP congress conducted on 28 November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba as acting chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\u201d\n\nIn the suit with reference numbered HC/CV/774/2021, Anyakorah, on behalf of himself and all local government chairmen and ward executives, who emerged from the 28th November 2017 and 1st December 2017, by way of originating summons, sought a declaration that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the PDP (amended in 2017), \u201cthe said constitution is supreme,\u201d arguing that it has \u201ca binding force on all members and organs of the PDP and that any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the constitution is unlawful, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff also argued that it was unlawful for the PDP, \u201cwhether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, or at any other time, to adopt or publish the name of a state chairman, alongside persons purporting to be EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates without recourse to the officers and delegates that emerged in 2017.\n\nHe further sought an order nullifying or setting aside all Congresses, designations or appointment made by the PDP with respect to the state chairman for PDP in Anambra State, EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates amongst others.\n\nThis is as the plaintiff further prayed the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the PDP, its allies or cronies from further recognising or dealing with persons names on pages 14, 15 and 16 of the Bronchure for the South-East Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, \u201ceither as state Chairman, EXCO members, local government area chairmen or national delegates of PDP, Anambra State chapter.\n\nIn its judgment of June 9, 2021, the court upheld the prayer of the plaintiff, citing Article 2 of the PDP constitution,\n\nAccording to Justice Adeniyi, after listening to the claimant, Anyakora, local government chairmenand ward executives that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on November 28 2017 under the supervision of the chairman state caretaker committee said, \u201cI find merit in the Claimant\u2019s case and the same hereby succeeds. For avoidance of doubts and abundance of clarity, it is hereby adjudged as follows:\n\n\u201cIt is hereby declared that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party (amended in 2017), the said Constitution is supreme and it has a binding force on all members and organs of the Peoples Democratic Party, and any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the Constitution is unlawful, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that it is unlawful for the 1 Defendant, (PDP) whether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, or at any time to adopt or publish the name of a State Chairman, alongside persons purporting to be his Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, without recourse to the extant List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegated that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1 December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel or and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Covernment Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as Acting Chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that the arbitrary imposition by the 1st Defendant on its members of a State Chairman, Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, as contained atPages 14. 15 & 16 of the Defendant\u2019s Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, in ultra vires its power, unlawful, invalid, void and of no effcet whatsoever\u201d, Justice Adebiyi declared.\n\nIn view of this, Justice Adebiyi further ordered that, \u201cAll Congresses, designations or appointments made by the 1st Defendant with respect to the positions of the State Chairman of PDP Anambra State Chapter, Exco Members and Local Government Chairmen, as contained at Pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Southeast Zonal Congress Brochure of 6th March, 2021, are hereby nullified and set aside for being invalid, unlawful and ultra vires the powers of the 1st Defendant, the same not being in alignment with the List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, valided by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as State Caretaker Committee. Acting Chairman.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Justice Adebiyi said the \u201cfirst defendant is hereby ordered and compelled that during the conduct of all elections in Anambra State, to henceforth adopt, employ, recognise and use only the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, who shall continue to act in the capacities for which they were duly elected.\n\n\u201cAn Order of injunction is hereby issued, restraining the 1st Defendant, whether by itself, cronies, allies or representatives, from further recognising, dealing with or parading any person or group of persons listed at pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, either as State Chairman, Exco members or Local Government Area Chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party, Anambra State Chapter, except the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba.\u201d\n\nHe contended that all parties shall bear their respective costs of the action.\n\nThe implication of this is that unless the party succeeds at the appellate court, if it chooses to challenge the ruling of the lower court, it may find itself fielding parallel delegates in the November 6 election, which may call for the replication of the Zamfara scenario, which cost the All Progressives Congress, the North Western state in 2019.\n\nHow the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) handles this slippery judicial rulingwill determine the fate of the party in Anambra, a state it governed for some years before losing out to the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nHowever, Umeaba, at a press conference yesterday told journalists that: \u201cBased on the above (his reinstatement), I, Hon Chukwudi Umeaba, the acting chairman caretaker committee of PDP, Anambra State, working in concert with the terms of reference and the powers of my office will make pronouncements.\n\n\u201cI hereby suspend the ward congress of 9th June to elect a three-man Adhoc committee for the governorship primary. I will contact the NEC of our great party to give me a new date for the ward congresses that will elect the three-man ad hoc committee for the governorship primary.\u201d\n\nHe urged the party members to keep calm and look forward to new developments as his leadership was out to ensure growth of the party in the state. He insisted that the primary election would go on as planned, and would not be truncated by the change in leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of a new chairman of the party in the state has polarised the party, leaving many of its members switching camp to the faction of the new leadership.\n\nA chieftain of the party, Mr Samuel Anyakorah, who was at the press conference described the Umeaba-led party as the authentic leadership of the party, having been unjustly removed in 2017.\n\n\u201cI was the one who dragged the party to court, because of that unjust act. We wrote to the then national vice chairman of South east, Mr Austin Umahi and even to His Excellency, Uche Secondus, but they ignored us.\n\n\u201cThat was why we went to court, and thank God today, the authentic leadership of the party has been restored. You can see how happy everybody is. We hope that the party will move on now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It was gathered that the EndSARS protests in 2020 made the government more desperate to control the cyberspace.\n\nIn a December 2020 report, University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, noted that the Nigeria\u2019s Defence Intelligence Agency had acquired equipment that it can use to spy on its citizens\u2019 calls and text messages.\n\nUniversity of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab researches on digital surveillance, security, privacy and accountability.\n\nThe report, titled Running in Circles: Uncovering the Clients of Cyber-espionage Firm Circles, said a telecom surveillance company by the name of Circles has been helping state security apparatuses across 25 countries, including Nigeria, to spy on the communications of opposition figures, journalists, and protesters.\n\nThe Citizen Lab report also said Circles was affiliated with Tel Aviv-based NSO Group, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, whose software, Pegasus, has allegedly been used by several governments to spy on dissidents by taking control of their smartphone, its cameras and microphones, and mining the user\u2019s personal data.\n\nCircles, on the other hand, is known for selling systems to exploit Signalling System 7 (SS7) vulnerabilities and claims to have sold the technology to several countries, according to the report.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "text": "Before the 2015 general election, it was Muhammadu Buhari all the way. In fact, at a point, the name became a household name, especially for die-hard supporters, who threw their all into making sure Buhari won the election.\n\nAfter his failed attempts at winning the 2003, 2007 and 2011 presidential polls, three biggest opposition parties \u2013 the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) came together and formed the All Progressives Congress (APC) in February 2013.\n\nDesperate to win the 2015 presidential elections, the party made all manner of promises, including ban on government officials from going abroad for medical treatment; generation, transmission and distribution of at least 20,000 megawatt of electricity within four years; making naira stable at the international market; amending the Nigerian Constitution to ensure devolution of powers, duties, and responsibilities to states in order to entrench true federalism; ending gas flaring and ensuring sales of at least half of gas produced within the country, among others.\n\nRegrettably, six years down the line, Buhari and his party have failed to even deliver on the three cardinal points of reviving the economy, improving security and fighting corruption, which were the main thrust of their campaign.\n\nBut the presidency has reeled out Buhari\u2019s achievements in different sectors in celebration of his sixth anniversary: They are: infrastructure, power, housing, agriculture, education, health, asset recovery, security and justice reform, diplomacy and international relations.\n\nIn agriculture, for instance, the presidency noted that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish). When you put this in context, it means empowering 3.1 million smallholder farmers would invariably improve food production, but the reverse has been the case as food inflation keeps hitting the roof. In the last two years, more farmers have been killed more than any other time in the history of the country.\n\nTo say the least, President Buhari\u2019s six years in office has been hell on earth. It is nothing to write home about as woes, anguish and insecurity has become the order of the day.\n\nObviously, Buhari\u2019s government has clearly demonstrated that it lacks the capacity to bring governance closer to the people. The economy is not shaping up. Key economic indicators show that inflation rate has moved 9.00percent in 2015 to 18.12percent in 2021; unemployment rate from 8.19percent in 2015 to 33.28percent in 2021; debt profile from N12.60trn in 2015 to N32.92trn in 2021; exchange rate from $1/N197 in 2015 to $1/N410 in 2021; foreign reserves from $28.57bn in 2015 to $34.27bn in 2021 and GDP growth rate 2.79percent in 2015 to 0.5percent in (Q1 2021).\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate has been described as a \u2018time bomb\u2019 waiting to explode. But the stark reality is that the time bomb has since exploded before our very face in the form of terrorism, banditry, armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, rapists and ritualists.\n\nEvery part of the country is facing one form of security threat or the other. For instance, in the North-East, it is terrorism, North-West is banditry, while in the North-Central, it has been Fulani herdsmen killing hapless farmers, especially in Benue State.\n\nIn the southern part of the country, South-East precisely, it is attack on police stations, INEC offices and correctional centres, in the South-South; it is more of kidnapping and cult clashes. In the South-West, it is communal clashes.\n\nThe recent attack in Igangan, a community in Ibarapa North Local Government of Oyo State, where over 20 people were killed, was one of such clashes.\n\nAs a retired general, many Nigerians had thought that with Buhari at the helms of affairs, the security challenges undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence would have effectively been nipped in the bud. Alas! Six years after, Nigerians are asking: how did we get to this state of hopelessness? Unfortunately, this ugly situation has largely scared away foreign investors.\n\nCorruption under this government is mind-boggling. A president, who is serious about fighting corruption, championing transparency and accountability in governance, should have sent a strong message to some officials of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) accused of looting and financial rascality.\n\nUnder this administration, the country\u2019s external and domestic debts have continued to rise with no commensurate improvements in the quality of life of the people. According to the Debt Management Office, external debt has risen exponentially to hit $33.34bn by December 2021 compared to $10.31bn in June 2015.\n\nNo doubt, Buhari\u2019s six years in office is something Nigerians will not forget in a hurry because of the untold hardship many have been subjected to. They argued that the remaining two years look bleak and uncertain.\n\nThe question many now ask is: can he redeem his image with the two years left in his tenure? Can he listen to voices of reason and truly be a president for all Nigerians? Can he assert himself as the president and Commander-in-Chief and stop playing aloofness in matters of national importance?\n\nAs it stands, what Buhari will be best remembered for are hunger and destruction of life and property. The hue and cry in the land is quite alarming. This is certainly not a legacy any sane man would want to be remembered for.\n\nTherefore, the president should, as a matter of urgency, use his remaining two years to redeem himself by rising to the occasion when the need arises, listen to voice of reasons and be prompt and decisive in dealing with criminal elements bent on destroying the country. He should look into the wanton killings, especially those ones being committed by his fellow Fulani people. At this challenging time, he should be in the fore front of uniting the country. In fact, now is the time for him to sit up and call the shots.\n\nBuhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) made lots of promises to Nigerians, including restructuring of the country to give every section of the country a sense of belonging. The Nasir el-Rufai Committee has since 2018 submitted its report. He should go ahead and implement the report. Not doing so will not only bring him in a bad light, but also as a man who lacks integrity and courage.\n\nAs the ninth National Assembly gears towards passing the Electoral Act Amendment bill before going on its long recess in July, Buhari owes Nigerians a duty to sign that bill into law. It is high time credible and competent men, women and the youths in Nigeria occupied exalted positions and not charlatans.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter months of speculation, Dangote urea fertiliser is now finally on sale nationwide and it currently pushes out a minimum of 120 trucks per day across the country.\n\nThe Group Executive Director (Strategy, Capital Projects & Portfolio Development), Dangote Industries Limited, Devakumar Edwin, revealed to the press over the weekend that the plant which has the capacity to turn out more than 4,500 tonnes of urea per day will conveniently meet the local demand and even produce for exports.\n\nAccording to him: \u201c\u2026We have the capacity to turn out 4,500 tonnes of urea everyday\u2026this is a bulk application fertiliser\u2026each crop in Nigeria or globally will require Nitrogen and this is a rich fertiliser, having 46 per cent nitrogen\u2026The company has the capacity to meet local demand and also export to African countries\u2026 Currently, the demand is less than 1 million tonnes and we alone can produce 3 million tonnes, so we can easily meet local demand and also produce for export to other West African countries.\u201d\n\nAside fertiliser production, the company, according to Mr Edwin, is already working to support the farmers with training on application of the fertiliser and even establish laboratories across the country for proper soil examination.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness of this plant, apart from the fact that we are producing is the focus on farmers\u2019 support, on training, education, development as we are now establishing laboratories across the country and even mobile laboratories where we can go drive around and take soil samples for proper examination to effectively grow the agricultural outputs across the country.\u201d\n\nThe urea fertiliser plant was built to tap into Nigeria\u2019s demand for fertiliser, a critical component of achieving food sufficiency for Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nThe fertiliser plant is expected to manufacture 3 million metric tonnes of urea per annum, with a view to reducing the nation\u2019s fertiliser imports, and generating $400 million annual foreign exchange from export to Africa countries.\n\nMeanwhile, marketers and farmers in Kano have described the newly introduced Dangote fertiliser as a game changer and a forecast for the expected agricultural revolution in the country.\n\nMarketers and farmers who were apparently excited, over the weekend welcomed the more than ten trucks that entered Kano markets at the weekend.\n\nSpeaking at the event organised by Dan-Hydro company in Kano to mark the introduction of the fertiliser into the northern market, the chairman of the Kano State Agro Dealers Association, Shuaibu Akarami, said agro dealers have confidence in Dangote fertiliser as they have in all his products, adding that as a dealer who spent decades in the business, he has discovered that Dangote fertiliser will have no problem penetrating the market in the North.\n\n\u201cI have checked the product and have found out that it will have no problem penetrating the market. With my experience in agro products, I can authoritatively say the product has met our expectations and that has confirmed the confidence we have in Dangote fertiliser and other sister products of the Dangote Group,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Dan-Hydro fertilizer company in Kano which took delivery of the first batch of trucks in Kano said the timing and strategy for the introduction are rife.\n\nThe head of operations at Dan-Hydro, Hamadi Drammeh, said the Dangote fertiliser conforms to all set standard required by the regulatory agencies.\n\nHe said the phenomenon of perennial shortage of the fertiliser product will be over in the country.\n\nHe said as part of its public enlightenment plan, the company was going to work with all stakeholders in the agricultural sectors.\n\nIn the same vein, the Sales Manager of Dan-Hydro, Sulaiman Tanko, assured that the product will be sold at a reasonable price that will enable fair competition in the market.",

He added that deployment of social media platforms, use of print and electronic media to create widespread public safety awareness against trading or building illegal structures under power lines could also be helpful.\n\nSpeaking on measures to curb vandalism of power infrastructure, Nweke called for the arrest and prosecution of all vandals and those who receive stolen items from them.\n\nHe advised that vandals of cable and other electrical accessories arrested by the Police should be paraded on television and other means of communications to also serve as a deterrent to others. He said BEDC has commenced fencing of its distribution substations with see-through materials for easy sighting of any suspicious movement around its installations.\n\nHe listed challenges confronting BEDC on the RoW of power lines to include illegal connections and reconnections, vandalism of power infrastructure, meter by-pass/energy theft, illegal activities of roadside electricians on the network and hanging of wires.\n\nOthers are unprofessional electrical wiring of houses, no earthing, trespass/illegal tampering with power equipment/installation, stringing of wires on top of iron roofing sheets of neighbours, hanging of clothes on electric wire/cable and use of aluminium ladder for illegal connections and reconnections.\n\nSome of the actions taken by BEDC according to Nweke to address RoW issues include mounting signages to warn people and advertising agents to desist from building/trading under power lines, disconnection of customers who violate the RoW of power lines in line with the Nigeria Electricity Management Services (NEMSA) directive and partnering with state governments of Delta, Edo, Ekiti and Ondo on identifying and demolishing of illegal structures under power lines.\n\nThe Safety Manager said BEDC has commenced the fencing of its distribution substations and outdoor installations with transparent wire gauze fences that can hinder easy access to vandals. The company is also partnering with safety institutions such as World Safety Organisation (WSO) and Institute of Safety Professionals of Nigeria (ISPON) to sensitise the public against vandalism of power infrastructure.\n\nAt the event, BEDC was honoured with a Merit Award of Excellence for its valuable contribution to environmental safety by the organisers.",

          "text": "Israel\u2019s Parliament, the Knesset, on Sunday, approved its new government and a new prime minister for the first time in 12 years, in a razor-thin 60-59 vote.\n\nThe vote, ringing in the leadership of a very diverse and cobbled-together coalition of right-wing, left-wing, centrist and Islamist parties, ousted Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader Benjamin Netanyahu. It also spared Israel from the prospect of a fifth election in less than two years, according CNBC.\n\nNow, after putting up a fight and trying several political options to remain in power, Netanyahu will move aside and Israeli tech millionaire and lawmaker Naftali Bennett, who many describe as more right-wing than his predecessor, will take the premiership.\n\nSunday\u2019s Knesset vote was marred by chaos and jeering, as some right-wing lawmakers including those from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party hurled insults at Bennett, calling him a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cliar\u201d for allying with leftist and Arab parties. At least four politicians were kicked out of the session by the speaker, Yariv Levin.\n\nBennett, formerly an aide to Netanyahu, continued his pre-vote speech amid the heckling, praising Netanyahu as having \u201cworked hard and faithfully for the state of Israel.\u201d But he also pressed on the need for new leadership.\n\n\u201cWe stopped the train before the abyss,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cThe time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the people, to stop, to stop this madness.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden congratulated Bennett and other leaders of the new government and cabinet.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with Prime Minister Bennett to strengthen all aspects of the close and enduring relationship between our two nations. Israel has no better friend than the United States. The bond that unites our people is evidence of our shared values and decades of close cooperation and as we continue to strengthen our partnership, the United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll be back soon\u2019\n\nThe right-wing 71-year-old\u2019s leadership, in its 12th year, has been a lightning rod and a longtime dividing line in Israeli society. One Israel expert told CNBC that the country\u2019s last election in March \u2014 its fourth in less than two years due to the complex and polarized nature of Israeli politics \u2014 really came down to whether the country wanted \u201cBibi or no Bibi,\u201d using the outgoing prime minister\u2019s popular nickname.\n\nAddressing the Knesset in English, acknowledging his party\u2019s shift into the opposition, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we have to be in opposition, we will do this standing tall \u2014 until we bring down this dangerous government and return to lead the state,\u201d he said in a defiant address, saying that he spoke for millions of Israelis who voted for him.\n\nHe also slammed legislation proposed by the new government that would limit a prime minister\u2019s term to eight years, four years less than his reign.\n\nNetanyahu himself is facing several charges of corruption, which he denies. He had been examining ways to avoid prosecution, which would have been much easier had he remained in power. Meanwhile, he can still remain the leader of the Likud party.\n\nThe outgoing prime minister drew international criticism and attention for his heavy-handed military action against Gaza in May, during which Israeli airstrikes killed more than 250 Palestinians, including 66 children, in response to rocket volleys from Hamas that killed 12 in Israel over the course of the fighting.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nThe new coalition now taking power has been led by the centrist lawmaker Yair Lapid, a former TV anchor and one-time finance minister and head of the Yesh Atid party, and his unlikely governing partner Naftali Bennett, who leads the minority party Yamina.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unusual for the leader of a minority party to become prime minister, but that\u2019s what was necessary for Bennett to join Lapid\u2019s coalition \u2014 and his alliance with Lapid was the only way the coalition would gain enough party seats in the Knesset to have a majority.\n\nSo the arrangement for Lapid and Bennett rests on the agreement that Bennett becomes prime minister, with the centrist Lapid as foreign minister, until 2023. At that point, if the alliance of parties survives, Lapid will take over the premiership.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time in Israeli history that its government includes an Arab party, which will aim to represent the country\u2019s 21% Arab minority.\n\nThe government is expected to focus on social and economic issues that are more likely to foster consensus among its varied members than divisive ones like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Palestinian statehood.\n\nBut serious challenges lie ahead. The fragile coalition between Lapid and Bennett, and the parties whose support they had to secure to achieve the magic number of a 61-seat majority in the Knesset is a risk to itself, analysts say. The only thing seemingly holding it together is a common desire to unseat Netanyahu. But because of its incredibly slim majority of 61 seats in the 120-person parliament, all it would take is one defection for the government to collapse.\n\nAnd given the sometimes extreme divergence in views among the parties within it, particularly between Israel\u2019s right-wing and Islamist politicians, this risk of gridlock and collapse remains a constant threat.\n\nCNBC",

          "text": "By Samuel Luka, Bauchi\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi state has given reasons regarding the recent dissolution of 21 Commissioners, including his Chief of Staff and the Secretary to the State Government (SSG).\n\nRecalled that the Governor had earlier in the week dissolved 21 Commissioners including his Chief of Staff, Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and others, sparing only few aides without attaching any reason to the action.\n\nMohammed who was speaking in Gamawa local government area on Saturday during the flagged-off ceremony of distribution of empowerment packages under Kaura Economic Empowerment (KEEP) said that the dissolved cabinet members did not do anything wrong.\n\n\u201cNone of them has done anything wrong, they all performed wonderfully, and I thank them because all that we have achieved so far is with their inputs\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Governor however, noted that some of the dissolved cabinet members, though very educated but were politically inexperienced, most especially bearing in mind that 2023 election is nearing.\n\n\u201cWe dissolved them to enable us watch our back and to restrategize, because we are about to enter politicking after two years. We thank those that worked with us\u201d, he said.\n\nBala added: \u201cwe are not denying the fact that they have worked for us, but some of them are well educated but lacked political experience, we must start politicking because that was the platform we used to clinch this position\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey did not do anything wrong as how they are being suspected, they have done their best in their capacities as bonafide citizens of Bauchi, so we thank them and may God reward them abundantly\u201d, the Governor further clarified.\n\nBala while thanking some PDP stakeholders in Gamawa, said with the mammoth crowd that came out to receive him, he can from today, go back to Bauchi and sleep because he is sure of winning Gamawa in 2023.\n\nThe Governor who recalled that, as an opposition party then, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won the governorship election in Bauchi, said they a lot of challenges because they met the state in shambles.\n\nAccording to him, he didn\u2019t seek for the position to enrich himself but rather, to salvage the state from sufferings in the hands of people who felt Bauchi is for sale in such a way that the citizens were being denied of their rights.",

          "title": "[Flashback] Obasanjo to Buhari : We are at the tipping point",
          "text": "In July 2019, former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in which he expressed anxieties about the state of the nation and the general insecurity.\n\nHe dwells on the lingering Boko Haram crises, the wave of kidnappings and the herdsmen crisis.\n\nThe letter carried a tone of urgency on Buhari needs to do as \u2018captain of the ship\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria is on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay,\u201d\n\nObasanjo warned in the letter.\n\nRead again afresh, the letter remains poignantly germane, as the problems he highlighted two years ago have worsened.\n\nWe reproduce the letter in full:\n\n\n\nDear President and General Buhari,\n\nI am constrained to write to you this open letter. I decided to make it an open letter because the issue is very weighty and must be greatly worrisome to all concerned Nigerians and that means all right-thinking Nigerians and those resident in Nigeria. Since the issue is of momentous concern to all well-meaning and all right-thinking Nigerians, it must be of great concern to you, and collective thinking and dialoguing is the best way of finding an appropriate and adequate solution to the problem. The contents of this letter, therefore, should be available to all those who can help in proffering effective solutions for the problem of insecurity in the land.\n\nOne of the spinoffs and accelerants is the misinformation and disinformation through the use of fake news. A number of articles, in recent days, have been attributed to me by some people who I believe may be seeking added credence and an attentive audience for their opinions and view-points. As you know very well, I will always boldly own what I say and disown what is put into my mouth. But the issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria. This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove. The issue is hitting at the foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our Nigerian community. I am very much worried and afraid that we are on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay. Without being immodest, as a Nigerian who still bears the scar of the Nigerian civil war on my body and with a son who bears the scar of fighting Boko Haram on his body, you can understand, I hope, why I am so concerned. When people are desperate and feel that they cannot have confidence in the ability of government to provide security for their lives and properties, they will take recourse to anything and everything that can guarantee their security individually and collectively.\n\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim. The recent explanation of the Chief of Army Staff for non-victory due to lack of commitment and lack of motivation on the part of troops bordering on sabotage speaks for itself. Say what you will, Boko Haram is still a daily issue of insecurity for those who are victimised, killed, maimed, kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and forced into marriage and for children forcibly recruited into carrying bombs on them to detonate among crowds of people to cause maximum destructions and damage. And Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks. How else do you deal with issues such as only about 50% literacy in North-East with over 70% unemployment?\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship. Perception may be as potent as reality at times. Whatever may be the grievances of Fulanis, if any, they need to be put out in the open and their grievances, if legitimate, be addressed; and if other ethnic groups have grievances, let them also be brought out in the open and addressed through debate and dialogue.\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country\n\nThe main issue, if I may dare say, is poor management or mismanagement of diversity which, on the other hand, is one of our greatest and most important assets. As a result, very onerous cloud is gathering. And rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity can only be the outcome. Nothing should be taken for granted, the clock is ticking with the cacophony of dissatisfaction and disaffection everywhere in and outside the country. The Presidency and the Congress in the US have signalled to us to put our house in order. The House of Lords in the UK had debated the Nigerian security situation. We must understand and appreciate the significance, implication and likely consequences of such concerns and deliberations.\n\nNo one can stop hate speech, violent agitation and smouldering violent agitation if he fans the embers of hatred, disaffection and violence. It will continue to snowball until it is out of control. A stitch in time saves nine, goes the old wise saying. With the death of Funke, Chief Fasoranti\u2019s daughter, some sympathetic Nigerian groups are saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Prof. Anya, a distinguished Nigerian merit Laureate, has this to say \u201cWe can no longer say with certainty that we have a nation\u201d. Niger-Delta leaders, South-Eastern leaders, Middle-Belt leaders and Northern Elders Forum have not remained quiet. Different ordinary Nigerians at home and abroad are calling for different measures to address or ameliorate the situation. All the calls and cries can only continue to be ignored at the expense of Nigerian unity, if not its continued existence.\n\nTo be explicit and without equivocation, Mr. President and General, I am deeply worried about four avoidable calamities:\n\n1. abandoning Nigeria into the hands of criminals who are all being suspected, rightly or wrongly, as Fulanis and terrorists of Boko Haram type.\n\n2. spontaneous or planned reprisal attacks against Fulanis which may inadvertently or advertently mushroom into pogrom or Rwanda-type genocide that we did not believe could happen and yet it happened.\n\n3. similar attacks against any other tribe or ethnic group anywhere in the country initiated by rumours, fears, intimidation and revenge capable of leading to pogrom.\n\n4. violent uprising beginning from one section of the country and spreading quickly to other areas and leading to dismemberment of the country.\n\nIt happened to Yugoslavia not too long ago. If we do not act now, one or all of these scenarios may happen. We must pray and take effective actions at the same time. The initiative is in the hands of the President of the nation, but he cannot do it alone. In my part of the world, if you are sharpening your cutlass and a mad man comes from behind to take the cutlass from you, you need other people\u2019s assistance to have your cutlass back without being harmed. The mad men with serious criminal intent and terrorism as core value have taken cutlass of security. The need for assistance to regain control is obviously compelling and must be embraced now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at a public lecture, I had said, among other things, that:\n\n\u201cIn all these issues of mobilisation for national unity, stability, security, cooperation, development, growth and progress, there is no consensus. Like in the issue of security, government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society. It will be a national programme. We need unity of purpose and a nationally accepted strategic roadmap that will not change with the whims and caprices of any government. It must be owned by the citizens, people\u2019s policy and strategy implemented by the government no matter its colour and leaning.\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else.\n\nSome of the groups that I will suggest being contacted are traditional rulers, past heads of service (no matter how competent or incompetent they have been and how much they have contributed to the mess we are in), past heads of paramilitary organizations, private sector, civil society, community leaders particularly in the most affected areas, present and past governors, present and past local government leaders, religious leaders, past Heads of State, past intelligence chiefs, past Heads of Civil Service and relevant current and retired diplomats, members of the opposition and any groups that may be deemed relevant.\u201d\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else. We need cohesion and concentration of effort and maximum force \u2013 political, economic, social, psychological, and military \u2013 to deal successfully with the menace of criminality and terrorism separately and together. Blame game among own forces must be avoided. It is debilitating and only helpful to our adversary. We cannot dither anymore. It is time to confront this threat headlong and in a manner that is holistic, inclusive, and purposeful.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians, I pray that God may grant you, as our President, the wisdom, the understanding, the political will, and the courage to do what is right when it is right and without fear or favor. May God save, secure, protect and bless Nigeria. May He open to us a window of opportunity that we can still use to prevent the worst from happening. As we say in my village, \u201cMay God forbid bad thing\u201d.\n\nsigned\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO",
          "summary": "In July 2019, former President Olusegun Obasanjo wrote an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in which he expressed anxieties about the state of the nation and the general insecurity.\nHe dwells on the lingering Boko Haram crises, the wave of kidnappings and the herdsmen crisis.\nWe reproduce the letter in full:Dear President and General Buhari,I am constrained to write to you this open letter.\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim.\nAnd Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks.",

          "text": "Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has sent another open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari regarding the country\u2019s current predicament.\n\nObasanjo urged Buhari\u2019s administration to confront the country\u2019s degree of insecurity and herdsmen crisis and take immediate action before it\u2019s too late.\n\nIf Buhari\u2019s government does not act quickly, four disasters will occur, according to the former President.\n\nAllowing Nigeria to fall into the hands of suspected criminals, retaliatory attacks on Fulanis, attacks on other ethnic groups, and a series of uprisings in various parts of the country are among them.\n\nHe bemoaned the fact that Boko Haram has continued to terrorize Nigeria for more than a decade, including the six years Buhari has been in charge, and said it was a mistake to believe the insurgency battle had been won.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that if quick action is not done, a repeat of the Rwandan genocide might occur in Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo stated that Nigeria\u2019s fundamental problem is corruption, which if not addressed properly will result in a deluge of destruction, violence, calamity, and division.\n\nFull letter to President Buhari\n\nDear President and General Buhari,\n\nI am constrained to write to you this open letter. I decided to make it an open letter because the issue is very weighty and must be greatly worrisome to all concerned Nigerians and that means all right-thinking Nigerians and those resident in Nigeria. Since the issue is of momentous concern to all well-meaning and all right-thinking Nigerians, it must be of great concern to you, and collective thinking and dialoguing is the best way of finding an appropriate and adequate solution to the problem. The contents of this letter, therefore, should be available to all those who can help in proffering effective solutions for the problem of insecurity in the land.\n\nOne of the spinoffs and accelerants is the misinformation and disinformation through the use of fake news. A number of articles, in recent days, have been attributed to me by some people who I believe may be seeking added credence and an attentive audience for their opinions and view-points. As you know very well, I will always boldly own what I say and disown what is put into my mouth. But the issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria. This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove. The issue is hitting at the foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our Nigerian community. I am very much worried and afraid that we are on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay. Without being immodest, as a Nigerian who still bears the scar of the Nigerian civil war on my body and with a son who bears the scar of fighting Boko Haram on his body, you can understand, I hope, why I am so concerned. When people are desperate and feel that they cannot have confidence in the ability of government to provide security for their lives and properties, they will take recourse to anything and everything that can guarantee their security individually and collectively.\n\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim. The recent explanation of the Chief of Army Staff for non-victory due to lack of commitment and lack of motivation on the part of troops bordering on sabotage speaks for itself. Say what you will, Boko Haram is still a daily issue of insecurity for those who are victimised, killed, maimed, kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and forced into marriage and for children forcibly recruited into carrying bombs on them to detonate among crowds of people to cause maximum destructions and damage. And Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks. How else do you deal with issues such as only about 50% literacy in North-East with over 70% unemployment?\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship. Perception may be as potent as reality at times. Whatever may be the grievances of Fulanis, if any, they need to be put out in the open and their grievances, if legitimate, be addressed; and if other ethnic groups have grievances, let them also be brought out in the open and addressed through debate and dialogue.\n\nThe main issue, if I may dare say, is poor management or mismanagement of diversity which, on the other hand, is one of our greatest and most important assets. As a result, very onerous cloud is gathering. And rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity can only be the outcome. Nothing should be taken for granted, the clock is ticking with the cacophony of dissatisfaction and disaffection everywhere in and outside the country. The Presidency and the Congress in the US have signalled to us to put our house in order. The House of Lords in the UK had debated the Nigerian security situation. We must understand and appreciate the significance, implication and likely consequences of such concerns and deliberations.\n\nNo one can stop hate speech, violent agitation and smouldering violent agitation if he fans the embers of hatred, disaffection and violence. It will continue to snowball until it is out of control. A stitch in time saves nine, goes the old wise saying. With the death of Funke, Chief Fasoranti\u2019s daughter, some sympathetic Nigerian groups are saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Prof. Anya, a distinguished Nigerian merit Laureate, has this to say \u201cWe can no longer say with certainty that we have a nation\u201d. Niger-Delta leaders, South-Eastern leaders, Middle-Belt leaders and Northern Elders Forum have not remained quiet. Different ordinary Nigerians at home and abroad are calling for different measures to address or ameliorate the situation. All the calls and cries can only continue to be ignored at the expense of Nigerian unity, if not its continued existence.\n\nTo be explicit and without equivocation, Mr. President and General, I am deeply worried about four avoidable calamities:\n\n1. abandoning Nigeria into the hands of criminals who are all being suspected, rightly or wrongly, as Fulanis and terrorists of Boko Haram type.\n\n2. spontaneous or planned reprisal attacks against Fulanis which may inadvertently or advertently mushroom into pogrom or Rwanda-type genocide that we did not believe could happen and yet it happened.\n\n3. similar attacks against any other tribe or ethnic group anywhere in the country initiated by rumours, fears, intimidation and revenge capable of leading to pogrom.\n\n4. violent uprising beginning from one section of the country and spreading quickly to other areas and leading to dismemberment of the country.\n\nIt happened to Yugoslavia not too long ago. If we do not act now, one or all of these scenarios may happen. We must pray and take effective actions at the same time. The initiative is in the hands of the President of the nation, but he cannot do it alone. In my part of the world, if you are sharpening your cutlass and a mad man comes from behind to take the cutlass from you, you need other people\u2019s assistance to have your cutlass back without being harmed. The mad men with serious criminal intent and terrorism as core value have taken cutlass of security. The need for assistance to regain control is obviously compelling and must be embraced now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at a public lecture, I had said, among other things, that:\n\n\u201cIn all these issues of mobilisation for national unity, stability, security, cooperation, development, growth and progress, there is no consensus. Like in the issue of security, government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society. It will be a national programme. We need unity of purpose and a nationally accepted strategic roadmap that will not change with the whims and caprices of any government. It must be owned by the citizens, people\u2019s policy and strategy implemented by the government no matter it\u2019s color and leaning.\n\nSome of the groups that I will suggest being contacted are traditional rulers, past heads of service (no matter how competent or incompetent they have been and how much they have contributed to the mess we are in), past heads of paramilitary organizations, private sector, civil society, community leaders particularly in the most affected areas, present and past governors, present and past local government leaders, religious leaders, past Heads of State, past intelligence chiefs, past Heads of Civil Service and relevant current and retired diplomats, members of the opposition and any groups that may be deemed relevant.\u201d\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else. We need cohesion and concentration of effort and maximum force \u2013 political, economic, social, psychological, and military \u2013 to deal successfully with the menace of criminality and terrorism separately and together. Blame game among own forces must be avoided. It is debilitating and only helpful to our adversary. We cannot dither anymore. It is time to confront this threat headlong and in a manner that is holistic, inclusive, and purposeful.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians, I pray that God may grant you, as our President, the wisdom, the understanding, the political will, and the courage to do what is right when it is right and without fear or favor. May God save, secure, protect and bless Nigeria. May He open to us a window of opportunity that we can still use to prevent the worst from happening. As we say in my village, \u201cMay God forbid bad thing\u201d.\n\nsigned\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO",

          "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has lost his 12-year hold on power in Israel after its parliament voted in a new coalition government.\n\nRight-wing nationalist Naftali Bennett has been sworn in as prime minister, leading a \u201cgovernment of change\u201d.\n\nHe will lead an unprecedented coalition of parties which was approved with a razor-thin majority of 60-59.\n\nMr Bennett will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal.\n\nHe will then hand power over to Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid, for a further two years.\n\nMr Netanyahu \u2013 Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader who has dominated its political landscape for years \u2013 will remain head of the right-wing Likud party and become leader of the opposition.\n\nDuring the debate in the Knesset (parliament), a defiant Mr Netanyahu promised: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Mr Netanyahu walked over to Mr Bennett and shook his hand.\n\nHowever, representatives of the Palestinians have reacted dismissively to Israel\u2019s new government.\n\n\u201cThis is an internal Israeli affair. Our position has always been clear, what we want is a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said.\n\n\u201cIt is an occupation and a colonial entity, which we should resist by force to get our rights back,\u201d said a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has already sent his congratulations to Mr Bennett, saying he looks forward to working with him.\n\nWhy has this happened?\n\nMr Netanyahu served five terms, first from 1996 to 1999, then continuously from 2009 to 2021.\n\nHe called an election in April 2019 but failed to win enough support to form a new coalition government. Two more inconclusive elections followed.\n\nAfter the third, he formed a government of national unity with then-opposition leader Benny Gantz, but the deal collapsed and Israel went back to the polls in March.\n\nLikud emerged as the largest party, but after Mr Netanyahu was again unable to form a government, the task passed to Mr Lapid, whose party came second.\n\nOpposition to Mr Netanyahu staying in power had grown, not just among the left and centre but also among right-wing parties that are ordinarily ideologically aligned to Likud, including Yamina.\n\nAlthough Yamina came joint fifth in the election with only seven seats, its support was critical. After weeks of negotiations, Mr Lapid brought Yamina on board as part of a constellation of parties whose only common goal was to remove Mr Netanyahu from office.\n\nThe agreement involving eight factions with the 61 seats required for a majority was signed on 2 June, just half an hour before a deadline was due to expire, effectively sealing Mr Netanyahu\u2019s fate.\n\nWhat will the new government be like?\n\nIn appearance, Mr Bennett\u2019s government will be unlike any which has preceded it in Israel\u2019s 73-year history.\n\nThe alliance contains parties which have vast ideological differences, and perhaps most significantly includes the first independent Arab party to be part of a potential ruling coalition, Raam. It is also expected to have a record number of nine female ministers.\n\nThe inclusion of Raam and left-wing non-Arab Israeli parties means there could be friction on issues such as Israeli policies towards Palestinians \u2013 Yamina and another right-wing party, New Hope, are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for instance.\n\nThere could also be difficulties over social policies \u2013 while some parties want to advance gay rights, such as recognising same-sex marriages, Raam, an Islamist party, is against this.\n\nIn addition, some parties want to relax religious restrictions more extensively than Yamina \u2013 a national-religious party \u2013 will likely allow.\n\nMr Bennett has indicated his government would focus on areas where agreement was possible, like economic issues or the coronavirus pandemic, while avoiding more contentious matters.\n\n\u201cNobody will have to give up their ideology,\u201d he recently said, \u201cbut all will have to postpone the realisation of some of their dreams\u2026 We\u2019ll focus on what can be achieved, rather than arguing about what cannot.\u201d",

          "text": "Former governor of Edo State and One-time National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, John Odigie Oyegun, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the ruling party not to wait till agitations from different sections of the country on restructuring snowball into a threat to national unity before addressing them.\n\nThe party chieftain said the earlier those issues are addressed the easier it is to diffuse the tensions currently building across the country.\n\nOyegun, who stated this at the public presentation of a book titled \u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u201d written by the director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGD) Mallam Salihu Moh. Lukman, stressed that the APC as the government of the federation, \u201cmust not give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that it is in fact, mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subjectto become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\n\n\u201cSo, the earlier we address it, the earlier we show that as a party we are responsive to the feelings of the people, the desires of the people and the wants of the people. \u201d It becomes easier then to diffuse the kind of stresses that the nation is passing through today. Look at what is happening. Well, it is recommended there should be State Police.\u201d\n\nOn the need to rebuild the APC from bottom to the top approach, Chief Oyegun warned against bending the party\u2019s rules.\n\n\u201cYou can stretch the rule. Never break it. Secondly, it is very fundamental that in all we do, the ranks-and-file members of the party and of parties generally, are able to see that even when they lose, they have been treated fairly, they have been treated decently because what I observed, I was made the Chairman of the reconciliation group in the South-south and in every single case, you have a situation where during elections, the civil war within the party alone, makes it impossible to think of it. Why is it civil war? Civil war because critical stakeholders in the party see that they have not been fairly, justly treated.\u201d\n\nFor the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi state governor, Atiku Bagudu, said the APC is awared that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed and it will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cThe party is not shy to acknowledge that our constitution is not perfect and again under John Oyegun, the El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism was created to look at those issues that we should do better about. APC believe is let us amend constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better, I believe the proposal which have been submitted to the National Assembly will help to produce amended Constitution that will meet most of the aspirations.\n\nIn her goodwill message, the mother of day and a former Nigerian envoy, Fatima Balla Abubakar, who said APC\u2019s popularity can be attributed, significantly, to President Muhammadu Buhari, called on the government to quickly address the growing social unrest for the party to regain confidence.\n\n\u201cAs the party in power which also has control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the APC must redouble its efforts to regain public confidence and trust which have been eroded in these deeply trying times. We cannot regain public confidence in our party as well as the government if we do not seriously address the growing social unrest due to growing mistrust between citizens main|y induced by poverty, lack ofjobs and livelihood. It is only when trust is rebuilt that we can restore peace.\n\n\u201cAs a government in power, APC needs to start thinking and doing things differently so that it can begin to deploy more people oriented policies to boost socio-economic growth and development and to provide more relief to the people.\n\n\u201cThe present situation in the country calls for more robust intellectual and policy oriented discussions and engagements by our party. We must engage with a spirit of transparency and inclusiveness. We must create a big tent where different views and positions are discussed without bitterness.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the APC government for his opportunity to serve, the author of the book, Salihu Moh. Lukman, said APC leaders have been working to address some of the foundational issues of democracy and that the book \u201cis a contribution to support initiatives of our leaders. All leaders and members of APC are therefore invited to engage challenges facing the party, government and the nation with every confidence and belief in the capacity of Nigerians to support every patriotic and nationalistic initiative. We much never allow the loud noise of selfish political entrepreneurs to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that our party and governments produced by our party have failed.\n\n\u201cIt will be a mockery of our political history to allow any narrative in the public space, which suggest that comparative to previous administrations since 1999, APC controlled administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari has failed. Like President Muhammadu Buhari himself has acknowledged, there are no doubt challenges facing the country, but no administration since 1999 has succeeded in completing projects, whether initiated by previous or current governments.\n\n\u201cJust on Thursday, June 10, 2021, President Buhari commissioned the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway, a project started and completed by his administration. And because leaders of PDP are shameless, they had the temerity to make a public statement calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to \u2018stop taking credit for projects not initiated by him.\u2019 May be they also want President Buhari and APC to acquire all their scandalous records, which include abandoning the construction of the PDP National Secretariat after mobilising billions on Naira.\u201d",

          "text": "A motley alliance of Israeli parties on Sunday ousted Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, and formed a new government in a seismic shift in the country\u2019s turbulent politics.\n\nNaftali Bennett, a right-wing Jewish nationalist and former tech millionaire, was to take over at the helm of the eight-party bloc, united only by their shared disdain for the hawkish right-wing leader known as Bibi.\n\nNetanyahu, 71, in typically combative style, vowed shortly before his defeat that \u201cif it\u2019s our destiny to be in the opposition, we\u2019ll do so with our heads high until we take down this bad government and return to lead the country our way\u201d.\n\nBeloved as \u201cKing Bibi\u201d by his right-wing supporters and condemned as the \u201ccrime minister\u201d by his critics, Netanyahu has long been the dominant, and increasingly divisive, figure in Israeli politics.\n\nBut on Sunday, a vote in the Knesset legislature following weeks of intense political drama ended his government with a razor-thin majority of 60 to 59 in the 120-seat chamber.\n\nIn Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square, Netanyahu\u2019s opponents broke out in cheers and launched into an evening of joyous celebrations, having rallied in recent days with \u201cBye bye Bibi\u201d placards.\n\nOne of the demonstrators, Tal Surkis, 19, confessed to \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the incoming change coalition, but said \u201cit\u2019s something Israel needs\u201d.\n\nBennett, 49, in a Knesset speech before the vote, promised the new government, a coalition of ideologically divergent parties, \u201crepresents all of Israel\u201d.\n\nHe said the country, after four inconclusive elections in under two years, had been thrown \u201cinto a maelstrom of hatred and in-fighting\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for different leaders, from all parts of the population, to stop, to stop this madness\u201d, he said, to angry shouts of \u201cliar\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d from right-wing opponents.\n\nFragile Coalition\n\nNetanyahu, who is battling corruption charges in an ongoing trial he dismisses as a conspiracy, has been the dominant Israeli politician of his generation, having also served a previous three-year term in the 1990s.\n\nHis supporters have hailed him as a strong defender of Israel who has been tough on arch foe Iran, but also struck a series of historic normalisation deals with several Arab nations last year.\n\nBeing ousted from the top job will leave Netanyahu more exposed to his legal woes, because it denies him the chance to push through parliament changes to basic laws that could give him immunity.\n\nBennett, a former defence minister under Netanyahu, vowed to keep Israel safe from Iran, promising that \u201cIsrael won\u2019t let Iran have nuclear weapons\u201d \u2014 a goal the Islamic republic denies pursuing.\n\nNetanyahu, true to his reputation as Israel\u2019s \u201cMr Security\u201d, charged that \u201cIran is celebrating\u201d the launch of what he charged would be a \u201cdangerous\u201d and weak left-wing government.\n\nThe diverse anti-Netanyahu bloc was cobbled together by the secular centrist Yair Lapid, a former TV presenter.\n\nIt spans the political spectrum, including three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an Arab Islamic conservative party.\n\nLapid, 57, is to serve as foreign minister for the next two years before taking over from Bennett.\n\n\u2018Scorched earth\u2019\n\nThe improbable alliance emerged weeks after an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, and following inter-communal violence in Israeli cities with significant Arab populations.\n\nNetanyahu, who long ago earned a reputation as Israel\u2019s ultimate political survivor, in his final days in office tried to peel off defectors, hoping to deprive the nascent coalition of its wafer-thin legislative majority, to no avail.\n\nHe accused Bennett of \u201cfraud\u201d for siding with rivals, and angry rallies by the premier\u2019s Likud party supporters resulted in security being bolstered for some lawmakers.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s opponents accused him and his allies of stoking tensions in a \u201cscorched-earth\u201d campaign.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s bombastic remarks as he saw his grip on power slip drew parallels at home and abroad to former US president Donald Trump, who described his election loss last year as the result of a rigged vote.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote came at a time of heightened tensions in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which has grown more bitter in the Netanyahu years, in part due to the expansion of settlements considered illegal under international law in the occupied West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, right-wing anger has grown in Israel over last week\u2019s postponement of a controversial Jewish nationalist march through flashpoint areas of east Jerusalem.\n\nThe \u201cMarch of the Flags\u201d is now slated for Tuesday, and the agitation surrounding it could represent a key initial test for a new coalition government.\n\nGaza\u2019s rulers Hamas said that the political developments in Jerusalem wouldn\u2019t change its relationship with Israel.\n\n\u201cThe form the Israeli government takes doesn\u2019t change the nature of our relationship,\u201d said the group\u2019s spokesman Fawzi Barhoum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a colonising and occupying power that we must resist.\u201d\n\nAFP",

He further noted that the corpses of those killed have been properly taken care of.\n\nThe spokesman said the road is now cleared for motorists and other road users with rigorous confidence-building patrol being intensified to avert hitches.\n\nTactical operatives including special forces personnel are, however, still combing the surrounding forest to ensure that the fleeing assailants are either apprehended or neutralized.\n\nREAD ALSO: Democracy Day: Use Of Teargas Was In Line With Global Standards \u2013 Police\n\nAt least 53 killed\n\nSunday\u2019s foiled attack comes barely two days after at least 53 persons were killed in an attack by bandits on some villages in Zamfara State leading to the cancellation of activities lined up for the Democracy Day celebration in the state.\n\nScores of motorcycle-riding gunmen called bandits earlier on Thursday through Friday, invaded the villages of Kadawa, Kwata, Maduba, Ganda Samu, Saulawa and Askawa in the Zurmi district, shooting residents.\n\nThe gang attacked farmers in their fields and pursued others who fled to escape the assaults.\n\nZamfara police spokesman Mohammed Shehu said 14 bodies had been taken to the state capital Gusau on Friday, and added that \u201cpolicemen deployed in the area following the attacks.\u201d\n\nLocal residents said 39 more bodies had been recovered and buried in the neighbouring town of Dauran.\n\n\u201cWe recovered 28 bodies yesterday and 11 more this morning from the villages and buried them here,\u201d said Dauran resident Haruna Abdulkarim.\n\n\u201cIt was dangerous to conduct the funeral there because the bandits are harbouring in the Zurmi forest and could return to attack the funeral,\u201d said another resident, Musa Arzika who reported the same death toll.\n\nVillages in the Zurmi district have been repeatedly raided by bandits, and local residents blocked a major highway last week, calling on the authorities to end the attacks.\n\nIn reaction to this, Governor Bello Matawalle suspended the Emir of Zurmi, Atiku Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nThe governor also cancelled all activities line up for the Democracy Day celebration and condemned the attack.\n\n\u201cPeople should remain calm and gentle, as well as go about their normal businesses. Security agents have been mobilised to the affected communities and directed to deal ruthlessly with anyone found disrupting the peace being enjoyed by our people.\n\n\u201cThe government deemed it necessary to suspend all the activities lined up for the democracy day for now, until further notice,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe governor asked residents to use Democracy Day to reflect and continue to pray for the intervention of God Almighty, to restore lasting peace in our state, region, and the country in general.\n\nThings Are Getting Worse By The Day\n\nIn his reaction to the tragic incident within Zurmi District, Governor Bello Matawalle on Saturday said the state of insecurity in the state is worsening at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201cI feel saddened by this unfortunate and barbaric act of cowardice,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a heavy heart, I convey my condolences on behalf of my family and the entire people of the State over this massacre.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, the act of banditry has reverted to the ugly dimensions it had prior to the coming of my administration. The marauders kill without regard for any rules of sanity. Women, the elderly, and children are not spared. As a result, a large number of people have been displaced in nearly every town in the State.\n\n\u201cMy dear people of Zamfara people, you are witnesses to what we have accomplished from the beginning of our administration, particularly the peace and reconciliation efforts that we initiated and achieved.

          "title": "NPFL 21: Nasarawa Utd Creates Goal-scoring Record, Fans Trouble Halt Play in Kaduna",
          "text": "Nasarawa United have continued their fine goal-scoring run in the Nigeria Professional Football League with a 2-0 victory over Plateau United on matchday 27 in Lafia.\n\nThe Solid Miners have scored 37 goals this season, the highest recorded by a team this season. Today in Lafia they made it back-to-back league wins, consolidating on the 3-1 win they achieved over Warri Wolves.\n\nThe game against Plateau United was tight at the start and failed to produce goals at half-time. In the second half, coach Bala Nikyu\u2019s team turned up and heat and took the lead in the 51st minute through Chinedu Ohanachom\u2019s goal. It was Ohanachom\u2019s fifth goal of the season.\n\nThe home side weren\u2019t done. They upped the game and pressurized the visitors till they were awarded a penalty in the 58th minute. The in-form Silas Nwankwo took the responsibility and scored to seal victory for the hosts. That was Nwankwo\u2019s 11th goal of the season.\n\nFans Trouble In Kaduna Again\n\nNasarawa United will have to wait to confirm their position on the league table because of the game at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium between Kano Pillars and Akwa United wasn\u2019t concluded due to crowd trouble. Match proceedings were going on fine until the 84th minute when Nyima Nwagua scored a goal that was ruled offside. The centre referee was trying to clarify the decision with his assistant when fans encroached the pitch and the match was abandoned.\n\nThe match was goalless at the time it was halted and will be concluded tomorrow morning. If it ends goalless, Nasarawa United will move to second on the log with 48 points while Akwa United will top the table with 49 points.\n\nA similar incident happened at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium. Precisely on matchday 25. Kano Pillars beat 2-1 and the moment Ifeanyi Eze scored the winner, the fans took over the pitch. The fans\u2019 presence was also felt on the pitch when the final whistle went off. This is a breach of the Nigeria Football Federation directive that fans should not be allowed into match venues in order to respect safety rules and protocols and limiting the spread of the Coronavirus.\n\nThe League Management Company and the Nigeria Football Federation are yet to make an official statement on the fans\u2019 trouble that happened in Kaduna on matchday 25 and today\u2019s incident.\n\nFestival Of Goals\n\nKatsina United produced arguably the most shocking result of the matchday beating Enyimba FC 3-1 at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium. Before half-time, the hosts were leading 3-0. Samuel Kalu opened scoring in the 19th minute while Rasheed Ahmed doubled the lead in the 38th minute. Just before half-time Mahmud Abdulwasiu scored to give the Changi Boys a comfortable lead into the break.\n\nAnayo Iwuala pulled one back for the People\u2019s Elephant but the damage was already done. This is their 7th defeat of the season and the first time Enyimba will be conceding 3 goals in the league since January 2020 when they lost 4-0 to Plateau United.\n\nIndeed, matchday 27 produced a festival of goals. In Enugu, Rangers International Football Club got their league campaign back on track with a 4-1 spanking of Sunshine Stars. Ifeanyi Nweke, Israel Abia , Godspower Aniefiok and Ibrahim Olawoyin scored goals for the Flying Antelopes to record the 12th win of the season.\n\nIn Bauchi, Wikki Tourists and FC Ifeanyi Ubah produced a 7-goal thriller. The goals kept pouring in. Nafizi Yahaya scored hat-trick to give the hosts victory. But when they were getting complacent at 4-0, the visitors started a late fight. Under 12 minutes, Ekene Awazie scored a brace while Nonso Nzediegwu scored one in the 90th minute. They would have gotten something out of the match if there was more time but they started the comeback fight too late. It\u2019s just the 7th win of the season for Wikki Tourists but it\u2019s huge relief for a team hoping to avoid the drop.\n\nThe Giant Killers\n\nDakkada FC and Adamawa United earned the giant killers tag with their impressive performances.\n\nAfter losing 1-0 to Sunshine Stars on matchday 26, Dakkada was hoping to avoid back-to-back defeats when they filed out to take on struggling Warri Wolves in Ozoro. Warri Wolves also lost their match, a 3-1 defeat at Nasarawa United. Due to inconsistent league results, the Warri based are also battling to keep top flight status. Pre-match analysis favoured Warri Wolves to beat Dakkada.\n\nBut beating big teams is not new to the \u2018small\u2019 team from Uyo. Last season, they beat Rangers 2-0 at the Cathedral in Enugu. This season, they\u2019ve beaten FC Ifeanyi Ubah in an away fixture and were seeking a second away win.\n\nThe game in Ozoro witnessed both sides creating chances but the no goal was scored until the 61st minute when Kareem Abdoulaye scored for the visitors. Warri Wolve pushed and searched for the equaliser but it didn\u2019t come. Dakkada won 1-0 to add to the woes of the home side that have lost 14 games this season and not battling relegation.\n\nAdamawa United confirmed they will not go down without a fight. Coach Justin Magudu\u2019s team sits comfortably at the bottom of the league table with just 16 points from 26 matches. They lost their last match 2-1 to Enyimba but today, against Rivers United, they were ready to prove a point. And they did!\n\nAn early goal scored by Hassan Surajo gave the \u2018small\u2019 team the lead and just before half-time, Fabian Nworie\u2019s own-goal gave Adamawa United a 2-0 lead into the break. When play resumed, Rivers United couldn\u2019t do much to get back into the game. It finished 2-0. Shocking!\n\nIt\u2019s just a 4th win of the season for Adamawa United and doesn\u2019t make much difference to their survival fight but it\u2019s a victory for the records and seals bragging rights over a big team as Rivers United.\n\nHome Invincibility\n\nA late goal scored by Christopher Nwanze gave Kwara United a crucial 1-0 win over MFM Football Club of Lagos. The win also means the Harmony are still unbeaten at home this season. With Rivers United losing to Adamawa United, the win takes coach Abdullahi Biffo\u2019s team back into the top four. A position they have maintained since the start of the campaign and such consistency confirms their zeal to compete for the league title.\n\nSince losing 1-2 to Nasarawa United on Sunday, 3rd January, Heartland FC have not lost a game at the Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri. Today, they held on to a hard fought 2-1 victory over Jigawa Golden Stars.\n\nTwo minutes into the match, Nwaodu Chukwudi scored the first goal for the hosts. With the constant forward play, Coach Fidelis Ilechukwu\u2019s team showed that they wanted the win and moments later, Emeka Atuloma scored the second that sealed the victory. It\u2019s the 10th win of the season for the Naze Millionaires and shoots them into the top ten.\n\nAnother them with home invincibility is Abia Warriors. Since the team moved to Okigwe from matchday 6, the Warriors have won 8 matches out of 11 and drawn 3. They have scored 22 goals at home and conceded just six.\n\nToday, first-half goals from Chukwuemeka Obioma and Paul Samson gave coach Imama Amapakabo\u2019s team a 2-0 win over Lobi stars who were hoping to consolidate on their matchday 26 win over Rangers in Markurdi. The Warriors are now unbeaten in six matches.",

          "text": "Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen was \u201cgone\u201d before he was resuscitated after suffering a cardiac arrest, the team\u2019s doctor, Morten Boesen, said in a news conference Sunday.\n\nEriksen is in a stable condition after he was taken to a hospital in Copenhagen on Saturday after he collapsed on the pitch during Denmark\u2019s Euro 2020 opener against Finland.\n\n\u201cHe was gone, and we did cardiac resuscitation. It was a cardiac arrest,\u201d Boesen said. \u201cHow close were we [to losing Eriksen]? I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWe got him back after one defibrillator, so that\u2019s quite fast. I\u2019m not a cardiologist, so the details I will leave to the experts at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe game between Denmark and Finland was halted in the 43rd minute following the incident and was resumed later Saturday, resulting in a 1-0 victory for the Fins with Eriksen being named star of the match.\n\nDenmark boss Kasper Hjulmand said he thought it was wrong for players to be asked if they wanted to continue the match following the incident.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Hjulmand said. \u201cBut looking back it was the wrong thing to make the decision between the two scenarios to the players in this case.\n\n\u201cPlayers were in a shock condition. Players who didn\u2019t really know yet if they had lost their best friend. And they have to decide between these two things. And I have a sense that we shouldn\u2019t have played.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s just a feeling I have. Maybe we should have just gone on to the bus and gone home and let\u2019s see what the next days would have brought.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my feeling now, but I think it was a very, very tough decision that the players had to try to make a decision. I know it\u2019s difficult, but I have a sense that it was wrong for the players to be given this situation.\u201d\n\nEriksen had just played a short pass when he fell facedown onto the ground and was given urgent medical attention for around 10 minutes. UEFA announced shortly after that the game had been suspended.\n\nThe midfielder was eventually carried off to a loud ovation, with his teammates walking next to the stretcher.\n\nUEFA said both teams had held an emergency meeting before deciding to continue playing, with Mathias Jensen replacing Eriksen in the lineup for the resumption of the fixture.\n\nHjulmand said the team spoke to Eriksen before resuming the game, adding that the Inter Milan midfielder was more focused on his teammates.\n\n\u201cTypically, Christian he was concerned about us and, of course, his family. He said \u2018I don\u2019t remember much\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m more concerned about you guys, how are you doing?\u2019 That\u2019s typical Christian. That just shows that these big players and their generosity. He\u2019s a hell of a player, but what a person he is as well.\u201d\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cMoments like this put everything in life into perspective. I wish Christian a full and speedy recovery and pray his family has strength and faith.\u201d\n\nHjulmand said he will assess his players\u2019 readiness to play again before their Group B game against Belgium on Thursday. \u201cWe will try tomorrow to establish normality as much as is possible,\u201d Hjulmand added. \u201cPlayers have different kinds of shocks and traumas and emotions.\n\n\u201cWe will try to use the next couple of days as good as possible. I will try to get a feeling of the players. Maybe for some, the time is too short to be able to play football again.\n\n\u201cWe will try to use it as a force to get even closer together and do our best in the next match. And I have a sense that we will be able to really get together and do our best. So try to reach normality in the training and do our best against Belgium.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel\u2019s parliament has put an end to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s 12-year-long tenure as prime minister in a vote on Sunday, approving in his stead an administration that has pledged to heal a nation bitterly divided over the departure of the country\u2019s longest-serving leader.\n\nNaftali Bennett was sworn in as Israel\u2019s new prime minister after winning a confidence vote with the narrowest of margins, just 60 votes to 59.\n\nAfter four elections in two years, Bennett\u2019s incoming government breaks a long political deadlock and ushers in the most diverse coalition Israel has ever seen, including the first Arab party to serve in the government. In his speech before the Knesset confidence vote, Bennett celebrated the diversity and warned of polarization within the country.\n\n\u201cTwice in history, we have lost our national home precisely because the leaders of the generation were not able to sit with one and another and compromise. Each was right, yet with all their being right, they burnt the house down on top of us,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI am proud of the ability to sit together with people with very different views from my own.\u201d\n\nBennett became the premier as the leader of Yamina, a right-wing party with only seven seats in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, making him the only prime minister in the country\u2019s history with such a small faction.\n\nBy contrast, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party won 30 seats in March\u2019s election. Once again, however, Netanyahu could not cobble together a governing coalition with a majority of the 120 members of Knesset.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday congratulated Bennett in his first statement about the political situation in Israel, saying he looked forward to working with the new prime minister.\n\n\u201cIsrael has no better friend than the United States,\u201d Biden also wrote in his statement.\n\n\u201cThe bond that unites our people is evidence of our shared values and decades of close cooperation and as we continue to strengthen our partnership, the United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cMy administration is fully committed to working with the new Israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel Adesanya got back to his winning ways on Sunday with an outstanding five-round showing in the UFC 263 main event\n\nMarvin Vettori believed he won his 2018 clash with Adesanya and never stopped calling for a rematch with the man who would go on to become UFC middleweight champion. Vettori got his rematch on Saturday night in the main event of UFC 263 and came up empty, with Adesanya taking a clear decision victory at Gila River Arena in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nVettori had only a few successful moments in the fight, scoring with a handful of takedowns, but Adesanya showcased improved grappling skills as he escaped back to his feet every time, including spinning out of a rear-naked choke attempt to end up in top position. Outside of those fleeting moments for Vettori, the fight was all Adesanya as he worked Vettori over with a steady diet of leg kicks.\n\nThose leg kicks took the explosiveness out of Vettori\u2019s takedown attempts, leaving him to spend much of the championship rounds leaning forward, clinging to Adesanya\u2019s legs while not being able to put the fight back on the ground. This drew taunts from Adesanya and boos from the crowd.\n\nEven with the fight clearly having gone Adesanya\u2019s way, after the final horn, the two briefly exchanged words, with Vettori claiming to have done enough to win the fight.\n\nIn the end, Adesanya took every round on all three official scorecards, winning by scores of 50-45 across the board. Adesanya has now successfully defended the 185-pound championship three times and rebounded from a loss in his previous fight, an attempt to become a two-division champion when he went to light heavyweight to face 205-pound champion Jan Blachowicz.\n\nAfter his victory, Adesanya called for a rematch with Robert Whittaker, the man he defeated to become champion.\n\n\u201cWhittaker, my arch-nemesis, Bobby,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the f\u2014 is gonna happen with COVID.

          "text": "According to Mr Okung owing to the unstable current global economic environment, the fate of the Nigerian economy lies in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people.\n\nThe NFL star had asked the Nigerian government to adopt a national bitcoin standard or risk falling behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\nTwitter CEO and billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey, is extremely bullish on the future of bitcoin in Nigeria. He says Nigerians will lead bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. \u201cThe people of Nigeria will lead #bitcoin \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cThe hope of Nigeria lies within this generation. I am proudly a Nigerian descendant living in America and am a proponent of Bitcoin. I write to urge the Nigerian government to pursue economic independence and financial sovereignty by pursuing a national Bitcoin standard. Soon every nation will be faced with this decision, but those who seize the present moment proactively as we have just witnessed in El Salvador, will enjoy significant advantages globally for generations to come.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the current global economic environment is worrisome and unsustainable. Sadly, the fate of the Nigerian economy is in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people. Despite the challenges we face, the resilience of Nigerians continues to inspire. The Nigerian society enjoys more favorable conditions than many of its neighbors. However, even greater opportunity awaits with the adoption of national action in favor of a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cThe tone of this letter is meant to convey urgency both in terms of the forthcoming economic despair and the limited window to act on this opportunity with fierce boldness and strong leadership. While the challenges of COVID-19 and increased global unrest continue to instill fear in the hearts and minds of citizens everywhere, Nigerians can claim international greatness by rising to the occasion that our unique times require.\n\n\u201cNations such as Iran, Russia, China and Kenya have been reportedly mining or otherwise utilizing bitcoin, often as a means to circumvent U.S. sanctions which prevent them from full participation in the global financial system. Other nations like Barbados, Singapore and Malta have moved to become \u201cbitcoin friendly\u201d in an effort to attract wealth and human capital through migration. And this week, El Salvador became the world\u2019s first nation to require merchants to accept bitcoin as legal tender. I\u2019m proposing an equally aggressive approach to national Bitcoin adoption which would significantly bolster every sector of the Nigerian economy and revitalize the spirit of every Nigerian domestically and abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the letter the NFL star says what\u2019s needed for the Nigerian economy to be reshaped is bold leadership with clear vision for a new future as the country does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not controlled, managed or operated by any single entity. It is an innovation that will surpass the automobile or the internet in terms of its impact on humanity. Nigeria does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin. All that is required is a vision for a new future and an allocation of its own national resources to pursue a Bitcoin standard,\u201d Mr Okung told the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for urgently pursuing and executing a national plan for adoption is the finite supply of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in circulation. This hard cap on the supply makes bitcoin even more verifiably finite than gold. As this simple yet unique property of scarcity becomes more widely understood, the economic laws of supply and demand will create a global frenzy to acquire as much bitcoin as possible, before it\u2019s too late. This momentum for acquiring bitcoin is already underway throughout the world and it is rapidly accelerating. In recent months, continued economic turmoil and uncertainty has created increased curiosity in bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMultiple institutional investors have announced sizable bitcoin allocations in their portfolios, some citing it as a hedge against a weakening U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government, along with every other government in the world, has a once in a generation opportunity to claim global prominence by rising to the occasion. Many other politicians in Latin America have signalled their intention to pursue similar moves as El Salvador.\n\n\u201cIn leading the next global financial shift, Nigeria can create prosperity for its citizens in a manner that requires no bloodshed, no election and no resistance. Such a proposition may seem too good to be true, and these ambitions certainly require thorough investigation, scrutiny and debate. Conversely, a delay in pursuing a national plan for bitcoin adoption will risk a scenario where Nigeria is left behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\n\u201cAs world leaders become more aware of the chance to make history, pursuit of bitcoin will be widespread. We offer our full support, a willingness to voluntarily consult and commitment to activate every resource available to us in order to see Nigeria pursue a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cNigeria must never carry last.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
