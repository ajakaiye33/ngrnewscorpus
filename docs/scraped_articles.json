          "text": "\u2026.FCT minister, original inhabitants disagree over status of Abuja City\n\n\u2026NLC wants immunity clause out of constitution for all elected officials\n\n\u2026CAN seeks proper definition of indigene, residency, creation of new states, others\n\n\u2026Number of cases on appeal to the Supreme Court keeps rising, says CJN\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nTHE Senate said yesterday it cannot give Nigeria a brand new constitution, as demanded by some socio-political and cultural organisations in the country, saying the best it could do was to amend the existing one as it was currently doing.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Southern and Middle Belt Forum had repeatedly argued that the National Assembly was wasting its time amending the present constitution, contending that what the country needs is a new constitution written by the people.\n\n\u2018NASS has no powers to issue new constitution\u2019But speaking yesterday at the opening of a two- day National Public Hearing on the further Alteration to the Provisions of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, in Abuja yesterday, Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman, Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, Senator Ovie Omo- Agege (APC, Delta Central), said though the Senate respects the opinion of some persons who want a new constitution, a section of the constitution does not give the National Assembly the powers to produce a brand new constitution.\n\nOmo-Agege, who assured Nigerians that the committee would be guided strictly by best legislative practices, highest ethical standards, integrity, open mindedness, and patriotism, however, implored every one, irrespective of political leanings and other affiliations, to abide by the same standards in their contributions.\n\nOmo-Agege said he is of the strong conviction that it is the desire of every Nigerian that the ongoing process produce positive transformations to our country, adding that all hands should be on deck to enable the 9th National Assembly bequeath to the country a constitution that speaks to every citizen\u2019s yearnings and aspirations.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow, some of our compatriots have urged that rather than amend the constitution, we should make a new constitution all together.\n\nWe respect this opinion, and we believe it is a most desirable proposition. \u201cHowever, we are conducting this exercise in accordance with the extant legal order, which is the 1999 Constitution. Specifically, Section 9 of the constitution empowers the National Assembly to alter the provisions of the constitution and prescribes the manner in which it is to be done.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it does not make similar provision or provide mechanism for replacing or re-writing an entirely new constitution.\n\nTo embark on any process without prior alteration of Section 9 of the constitution to provide the mode through which an entirely new constitution could be made, will amount to gross violation of our oath of allegiance to the constitution.\n\n\n\n\u2018Fresh amendment needed for new constitution\u2019\u201dIn other words, it will take a new constitutional amendment to be able to give Nigerians a most desired new constitution. It would be unconstitutional to do otherwise.\n\n\u201cCognisant of the truth that the will of the people is the foundation of any democratic and open society, the Senate places high value on public participation in the law-making process.\n\nAnd I assure you, this committee is strongly committed to its obligations to facilitate public involvement in the constitution review process. \u201cThat is why we have, from the commencement of the process, invited written submissions from citizens, governmental organizations, interest groups, socio-cultural organizations and civil society organisations and subsequently held zonal public hearings.\n\n\u201cToday, this national public hearing is testament to that commitment, and provides another opportunity for citizens to be actively involved by contributing to decisions that will undoubtedly have impact on their lives.\n\n\u201cSo far, the committee is immensely impressed with the public response to the constitution amendment exercise, and we are eager to repay the confidence of Nigerians by ensuring that the final product reflects the inputs citizens have made to the process.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated repeatedly since inception of this committee, Nigerian citizens are the pillar upon which the committee\u2019s work is anchored, and the success of the amendment process will largely depend on their beneficent support and partnership.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the memoranda the committee has received on a broad range of issues, we have also studied and engaged a select group of competent and non-partisan consultants to further examine specific recommendations from the reports of the 2014 National Conference and the All-Progressives Congress (APC) Committee on True Federalism requiring constitution amendment for implementation.\n\n\u201cThe committee has also revisited some of the bills in past constitution amendment exercises which did not pass the hurdles of concurrence with the House of Representatives, ratification by State Houses of Assembly and Presidential assent. \u201cWe have painstakingly re-examined those bills and reintroduced some of the proposals we deem beneficial to our people. We are looking at them to determine at what stage of the process they fell off the list and the reasons thereof, with a view to improving on them to suit the demands of our time and ensuring that they do not suffer the same fate.\n\n\u201cAs we work towards an inclusive amendment process underpinned by the public good, free from manipulations by self-interested or partisan actors and not dominated by destructive or short-term motives, I encourage you all to make your inputs with candour and guided very importantly by national interest. We are ready to listen closely to every view and reflect on every proposal and give due consideration to every contribution.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbuja\u2019s status triggers strong reactions\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s public hearing at the Africa Hall, International Conference Centre, Abuja, the very serious issue of land ownership and stateless status of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, reared its head strongly as the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Administration, FCTA, Musa Mohammed Bello, and original inhabitants of Abuja disagreed on fundamental issues with regard to the future of Abuja.When it was the turn of the FCTA minister to speak, he was more concerned about having new provisions in the constitution that will clearly demarcate the Federal Capital City for effective administration and prevent constant frictions in its functions and powers with that of the larger Abuja Municipal Councils, especially in the area of tax collection.But the original inhabitants of Abuja in their presentation, called for more access to political power at the centre, with a provision that will guarantee them a ministerial slot.\n\nAbuja indigenes demand own stateLed by their chairman, Dalhatu Ezekiel Musa, the original settlers of Abuja noted that anything short of having their own state would amount to gross injustice against them, adding that while some sections of the country are currently agitating to exit Nigeria, they are pleading to be included.\n\n\n\nNLC wants removal of immunity clauses\n\nIn its presentation to the committee, the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, which made a strong case for removal of immunity clause for elected public office holders on criminal cases, said the minimum wage should be retained on exclusive list.\n\nThe NLC, which threw its weight behind calls for full local government autonomy, independence of the judiciary, and financial autonomy for state legislature, said it was in support of electronic and diaspora voting, as well as pension on the exclusive legislative list.\n\n\n\nCAN lists demands\n\nOn its part, the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, called for proper definition of an indigene and residency, creation of new states like Sourthern Kaduna/ Kataf/ Gurara, Adada State from present Enugu State, Cross River North State, Okun State, Okigwe State, Oke- Ogun, among others, for administrative impartment and governmental dividends, independence of the Judiciary.\n\nAccording to CAN, the secularity of Nigeria must be maintained and there must be the removal of any religious provisions or if need be, insert also constitutional provisions for Ecclesiastical Courts.It added that there should be devolution and decentralisation of power and governance system through formal introduction of geo-political zones and regions with clearly assigned roles.\n\n\n\nNo of appeals to S-Court rising \u2014 CJN\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed, noted that the number of cases on appeal to the Supreme Court had kept rising, stressing that there was the need for outdated laws to be amended in order to reflect the present day reality.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe National Assembly has successfully reviewed/amended the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) (the Constitution) vide the First, Second, Third and Fourth Alteration Acts. I am happy that the National Assembly is embarking on another round of review of the constitution.\u201cAll public and private institutions and well-meaning Nigerians should contribute to this important national assignment.\n\nI understand that the public hearing already took place at various zones across the country.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is, therefore, being rounded up with this national public hearing in the nation\u2019s capital. To us in the judiciary, charged with the constitutional duty of interpreting the constitution and giving effect to its provisions and other laws of the land.\n\n\u2018\u2019We see this exercise as a golden opportunity. The Judiciary, as a mechanism for resolution of dispute, is an essential and indispensable institution in any human society.\n\nThe indispensability of courts manifests even in regimes that are not democratic (such as military regimes).\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the Court system has made immense contribution in stabilizing not only democratic governance but also political, economic, social and all important human endeavors.\n\n\u201cIn the course of discharging its duties, the Judiciary is faced with daunting challenges. The position of the Judiciary as one of the institutions that serve as pillars on which democracy and good governance rest, underscores the need for all stake holders in the sphere of governance to ensure that we have a robust system of administration of justice.\n\n\u201cThe jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Sections 232 and 233 of the Constitution is very wide. Our population also keeps on growing.\n\nMoreover, Nigerians guard and protect their rights jealously. The implication of all these is that the number of cases in our courts, which go on appeal to the Supreme Court keeps on rising.\n\n\u201cThis situation makes the workload on the Justices too much and accounts for cases pending for fairly long time. There is an instance where a case lasted for over 30 years from the trial court to the Supreme Court. It is only a litigant that God has given long life that can survive such a protracted litigation.\u2019\u2019",

The requirements for the post as contained in the advert must be ratified by a properly constituted Governing Council before publication. However, the advert was published without recourse to the Governing Council and was only presented to the body as a fait accompli, giving way to favoured candidates to emerge.\n\n\u201cAmong the contentious issues were the years of experience of interested candidates on professorial cadre, which was benchmarked at five years. The Chairman was accused of suggesting names of preferred candidates to the Council at its first meeting.\n\n\u201cThe Council that eventually ratified the advert and conditions published in the advert was not properly constituted, hence the candidates that emerged were selected and not appointed according to the laid down guidelines of the institution.\u201d\n\nStating that the Visitor, by his actions, did not delay the appointment but was only interested in a process fair to all candidates, the Special Adviser, said the Governing Council was given a second opportunity to undertake a fresh process of appointment, but a deluge of petitions appeared even before the outcome of the process was made public.\n\nDescribing LASU as a global brand and the best State University in Nigeria, Wahab said the institution was building a world-class Business School on Victoria Island and has already established a partnership with Cornell, an Ivy League University in New York, USA.\n\nAccording to him, the focus of the State Government is the constitution of a new Governing Council and a Visitation Panel that will ensure a free and transparent process of appointing the LASU Vice-Chancellor.\n\n\u201cWe desire a due and transparent process, which informed our stand that the appointment must be merit-based because you cannot build something on nothing; let the process throw up the best,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to the host\u2019s expressed belief that Nigeria is a country where the leader has to micro-manage, the Special Adviser maintained that LASU is an independent institution but, as Visitor, Governor Sanwo-Olu has the prerogative of intervening to prevent a flawed process of appointing a Vice Chancellor for the University.\n\nWahab, a lawyer, said the former Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, SAN, did exceedingly well as he put LASU on a global pedestal, pushed the institution\u2019s image and reputation to the world stage, and managed the deep-seated disagreement that led to this protracted process, which preceded his appointment and tenure.",

EKEDC was represented by its Managing Director/CEO, Adeoye Fadeyibi and directors, George Etomi and Dere Otubu. NDPHC was represented by its Managing Director/CEO, Chiedu Ugbo, Executive Director, Legal Services, Mohammed Mahmud and advisors, Sola Arifayan and Chukwubuike Onwuzurumba.\n\nThe governor stated that Lagos State is an interested stakeholder in the collaboration, and that he will continue to check with both EKEDC and NDPHC to follow up on the progress and ensure proper implementation.\n\nThe Managing Director/CEO of EKEDC, Adeoye Fadeyibi, said: \u201cAs a power utility company, we commend the vision of this administration for power generation and distribution in the state. We also appreciate your acknowledgment of the critical role of power in creating a sustainable city.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be partners in this laudable vision of your Excellency to transform Lagos State into the destination for all residential, commercial, and business interests. In alignment with the Governor\u2019s desire for stable and uninterrupted power supply for the state, we announce our partnership with the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) which aims to improve electricity supply by close to 400MW to Lagos State. Under this partnership, we will explore the modalities for the supply of power from two Power Plants\u201d, he said.\n\nFadeyibi noted that the deal aligns with the efforts of the EKEDC to bridge the metering gap and improve the quality of electricity supply to customers. He appreciated customers for their immense support for the company in its quest to continue to empower the quality of lives of all stakeholders.\n\nThe MD/CEO of NDPHC, Chiedu Ugbo, stated that EKEDC and NDPHC have complementary objectives of ensuring that power gets to the customers, and the investment required to do this is mobilised.

The former president, who expressed his worries that Nigerians usually perform- \u201cfantastically well\u201d outside the shores of the country, but seem to be under-performing when they are in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs of today, we have five Nigerians directly running international organisations and running them very well, and one or two at the number two level.\n\n\u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC; we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think, celebrated her 60th birthday, yesterday or day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN). These are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cThe point is that, if these people are here in Nigeria, if you hear of them at all, we would have shackled them and made it impossible for them to perform as they are performing outside.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned are doing fantastically well. We even have Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who just took over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs and Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo, why are they doing well there while we are not doing well here? Something must be wrong, we should be interrogating this, what should we do? What we should do is to put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the 14 million out-of-school children in the country, Obasanjo urged the leadership of the country to ensure education is provided for the children, saying \u201cotherwise, Nigeria is breeding future Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nHe added that education must take the forefront in order to put Nigeria on the right footing.\n\n\u201cMy prayer is that all of us, particularly, in this country and now, will have something to contribute to make this country what God has created it to be; a land flowing with milk and honey. Right now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, has accused the Federal Government of playing politics with judicial autonomy in total disregard to constitutional provisions.\n\nThe governor made the observation at the inauguration and handover of the National Industrial Court Judges\u2019 Quarters in Old Government Residential Area, Port Harcourt, yesterday.\n\nWike explained that under a federal system of government, it is only the executive arm of government, of all the tiers, that has the powers to present the annual budget to either State or National Assembly and also sign it into law.\n\nAccording to him, the new narrative that a presidential implementation committee has been set up and would direct governors to sign budgetary allocations for the judiciary is purely unconstitutional.\n\nGovernor Wike said a federal government that is promoting autonomy of the judiciary should not have allowed the nation\u2019s courts to be shut for about two months by Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\n\u201cIs it true that the Federal Government wants the autonomy of the judiciary? If the federal Government wants the autonomy of the judiciary, how can a government say that the courts should be shut down for almost two months now. Which country can survive when its courts are shut down for two months?\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the governor said his administration has fully implemented the autonomy for the judiciary and the legislature with releases of their financial entitlements as captured in the budget up till 2021.\n\nWike explained that the funds released by Rivers State Government to the judiciary far exceeds the planned deductions by the Federal Government.\n\nHe further declared that his administration is not owing parliamentary workers who are also currently on sympathy strike.\n\nHe said the no-work no-pay policy has come into force in Rivers State and that judiciary and parliamentary workers cannot sit at home and expect salary anymore.\n\nInaugurating the facility, Chief Justice of Nigeria, Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, noted that Governor Wike has remained a strong voice in the clamour for judicial independence and financial autonomy.\n\nRepresented by Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court, Justice Muhammad, said Governor Wike\u2019s affection and innate passion for the welfare and wellbeing of the Nigerian judiciary is worthy of emulation.",

          "text": "\u2022Insecurity does not make Nigeria failed state, insists FG\n\n\u2022Presidency: Foreign magazine\u2019s opinion on Nigeria distorted, unfair\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Kayode Fasua in Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nInsecurity Does Not Make Nigeria Failed State, Insists FG\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this yesterday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresidency: Foreign Magazine\u2019s Opinion on Nigeria Distorted, Unfair\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency yesterday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nPlots to Destroy Buhari\u2019s Govt will Fail, Says APC\n\nAlso yesterday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kingsley Nwezeh\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday allayed concerns about possible mass retirement of top military officers superior to the Chief of Army, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya.\n\nIt said contrary to reports of an impending exodus of about 30 Generals in the military following the appointment of Yahaya, a member of the 37 Regular Course of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), other major generals and equivalent ranks in the military senior to him would be redeployed to the Defence Headquarters.\n\nIn line with military tradition that forbids seniors saluting juniors, members of Course 35, 36 and 37 were expected to leave the service following Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that members of Course 35, notably the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP), Maj. Gen. Benjamin Ahanotu, and Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, have not been seen at official functions since Yahaya assumed duties.\n\nAhanotu\u2019s deputy has been standing in for him at official functions.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that most Course 36 officers were redeployed to Defence Headquarters and tri-service institutions, notably Armed Forces Resettlement Centre, Command and Staff College, Jaji and TRADOC and have since assumed duties.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, is of Course 34, whom by his seniority could accommodate officers of Courses 35 and 36 cadres in tri-service institutions under the DHQ.\n\nThe new army chief is believed to have accepted to work with his coursemates (Course 37).\n\nBriefing the media in Abuja yesterday, Acting Director of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Bri. Gen.\n\nBernard Onyeuko, said the military was not contemplating any retirement and had, in fact, not retired any general.\n\n\u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only voluntarily for senior officers who desire to do so,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAt this point, no retirement has been authorised by the military high command.\u201d\n\nHe said the military high command would not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate their proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe military high command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the armed forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko also reviewed DDMO\u2019s operational activities nationwide between May 20 and June 2.\n\nHe said the operations were the combined efforts of the military and other security agencies involving land, maritime and air operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is worthy of note that these operations are conducted simultaneously in the various theatres of operation on daily basis across the country. The unrelenting and committed efforts of the gallant troops as well as the cumulative results of our operational activities in the various operations and specific events will be highlighted under the different operations.\n\n\u201cWithin the period in focus, troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria intensified their operational efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, hoodlums and militancy as well as other criminalities across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d According to him, the troops conducted series of clearance patrols, ambush, raid, picketing, cordon and search operations as well as artillery bombardments.\n\nOthers are anti-piracy, anti-illegal oil bunkering, anti-crude oil theft, anti-pipeline vandalism and anti-smuggling operations. He said there were also extensive air operations, which included air patrols, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions, offensive air strikes, air interdictions, search and rescue operations, and close air support for ground troops.\n\nHe said troops of Operation Hadin Kai carried out series of operational activities.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey rescued kidnapped victims, neutralised scores of terrorists, destroyed terrorists\u2019 enclaves, arrested terrorists and intercepted terrorists\u2019 logistics items, including vehicles.\n\n\u201cOn 20 May 2021, troops had contact and engaged BHT criminal elements in Gwoza LGA of Borno State. This occurred as troops swiftly responded to a distress call by farmers on an attack on their location. Troops gallantly rescued the farmers. During the encounter, several terrorists were neutralised, while some others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ezeife: South-east Violence, Plot to Undermine Clamour for Igbo Presidency",
          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Barkindo: Oil industry\u2019s upstream spending slumped 30% in 2020\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nBarkindo: Oil Industry\u2019s Upstream Spending Slumped 30% in 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Only a few hours ago, today Friday May 14, 2021 House Republicans chose a cheerleader for former President Donald J. Trump, Rep. Elise Stefanik (of New York), to replace the truly conservative Liz Cheney (of Wyoming).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s official- Liz Cheney has been fired from House Leadership and I was proud to vote against her,\u201d Rep. Lance Gooden (Republican from Texas), yelled, literally on Twitter.\n\nChido Nwangwu\n\nAlongside a couple of right-wing hotheads and Trumpian junkies, a majority of the House Republicans were giddy and enthusiastic in removing Cheney from the #3 leadership post within the Republican Party\u2019s congressional conference.\n\nCheney\u2019s \u201ccrime\u201d? She challenged the errant, divisive and destructive lies and ways of the impeached former President Trump.\n\nThat one; Trump, the messy and pugnacious god of the nativists and violent groups and rings of conspiracy theorists who have captured the soul of the increasingly race-baiting political group who nominally later under the banner of the Republican.\n\nLiz, the 54-years old first daughter of the former Vice President Dick Cheney (under George W. Bush) has repeatedly condemned Trump for his toxic and false and provocative lies which claim baselessly that the presidential election was \u201cstolen\u201d due to (wait for it!) \u201cmassive voter fraud\u201d. Trump riled up the violent mob that set upon and attacked the U.S Capitol on January 6, 2021\u2014 with the core goal of interfering and interrupting the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory.\n\nThe mob was assembled by Trump and his cronies \u2014Including his \u201clawyer\u201d Rudy Guiliani who raised the graeco-roman era \u201ctrial by combat\u201d! as an option available for them and the congressional representatives at the Hill. He said this, openly, a few blocks from that crazy and shameful afternoon near the Capitol.\n\nThe removal of Cheney is setting the stage for a wider showdown between the forces of democratic rights and multiracial empowerment against the followers of power-drunk thin-gods, loquacious, racially-polarizing and quasi-autocratic movements filled with the attackers of police officers, violent insurrectionists, nihilists and other uniformed hustlers.\n\nShe was a portrait in courage and principle on January 6 when she condemned Trump and his goon squads for desecrating the congressional dignity and grace of the temples of American democracy.\n\nIn the light of the latest developments, the critical question becomes: Will those groveling, linguini-spine Republicans continue to roar and chant \u201chow high\u201d whenever Trump screamed \u201cJump!\u201d? It clearly seems evident that they will.\n\nLiz, this Wednesday at the House Republicans shameful fix to oust the courageous congresswoman, told her partisan, hypocritical colleagues that \u201cIf you want leaders who will enable and spread his destructive lies, I\u2019m not your person; you have plenty of others to choose from. That will be their legacy\u2026. But I promise you this, after today, I will be leading the fight to restore our party and our nation to conservative principles, to defeating socialism, to defending our republic, to making the GOP worthy again of being the party of Lincoln.\u201d\n\nAnd, she warned that Trump\u2019s rhetorics and nonsense about \u201cstolen election\u201d were threats to the democratic culture of these United States, damages the rule of law and short changes the citizens, diminishes the GOP brand, etc. Cheney was emphatic when she stated that:\n\n\u201cTrump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work \u2014 confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this. The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution. In the immediate wake of the violence of Jan. 6, almost all of us knew the gravity and the cause of what had just happened \u2014 we had witnessed it firsthand.\n\n\"I am a conservative Republican, and the most conservative of conservative values is reverence for the rule of law. Each of us swears an oath before God to uphold our Constitution. The electoral college has spoken. More than 60 state and federal courts, including multiple Trump-appointed judges, have rejected the former president\u2019s arguments, and refused to overturn election results. That is the rule of law; that is our constitutional system for resolving claims of election fraud.\n\n\"The question before us now is whether we will join Trump\u2019s crusade to delegitimize and undo the legal outcome of the 2020 election, with all the consequences that might have. I have worked overseas in nations where changes in leadership come only with violence, where democracy takes hold only until the next violent upheaval. America is exceptional because our constitutional system guards against that. At the heart of our republic is a commitment to the peaceful transfer of power among political rivals in accordance with law.\u201d\n\nI believe that the fight ahead of the 2022 mid-term elections and the 2024 presidential elections in the U.S has become very interesting.\n\n*Dr. Chido Nwangwu, the author of the forthcoming 2021 book, MLK, Mandela & Achebe: Power, Leadership and Identity, serves as Founder & Publisher of the first African-owned, U.S-based newspaper on the internet, USAfricaonline.com, and established USAfrica in 1992 in Houston.

          "title": "Can TalentQL\u2019s six-month program fill Africa\u2019s need for senior developers?",
          "text": "Adewale Yusuf, the founder and former publisher of Techpoint, made what many saw as a bold move last year.\n\nNot only did he swap the uncertainty of tech media for the vulnerability of founding a tech startup, he chose Ile-Ife, a town 200 km removed from the chaos of Lagos, as the \u201cquiet location\u201d for his new adventure.\n\nYusuf, along with one Jobberman co-founder and a couple other people, started TalentQL, an outsourcing firm for companies in need of quality software developers.\n\n\u201cHire top vetted technical talent across Africa quickly and seamlessly,\u201d their website says. Part of the plan was to produce talents by building campuses that house co-working spaces, with dependable electricity and Internet.\n\nOf course this is no longer a novel startup idea. Indeed it might appear late in the day to be getting into the \u201ctech talent matching\u201d game. Andela, one might say, has been there, done that. There probably isn\u2019t much mineral left in that mine.\n\nBut Yusuf thinks there is and has garnered resources to explore the endless possibilities that exist in the ecosystem. They launched last November with $300,000 seed money from Zedcrest Capital, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform and Prosper Otemuyiwa, a co-founder at Eden. In March this year, they got accepted into Techstars Toronto.\n\nFun fact: Over 70% of @TalentQL's African clients are Fintech companies.\n\nWe've placed CTO/Technical Lead in over 50% of them. \u2014 Adewale Yusuf (@AdewaleYusuf_) May 28, 2021\n\nYusuf is \u201cconvinced that what we are doing at TalentQL will change the African talent landscape. We believe that talent is Africa\u2019s greatest export and as such needs to be developed and refined.\u201d\n\nAll well and good. But what kind of talent are we exporting and why does it need to be refined? The answer has come nearly eight months after launch.\n\nMeet \u201cPipeline by TalentQL\u201c\n\nThis week, TalentQL has announced a \u201cspecialised training program for Software Engineers in Africa.\u201d It is coolly named Pipeline by TalentQL.\n\nThe program is for mid-level African software engineers, defined by TalentQL as those with three years work experience. In six intensive months, each of them will access \u201cadvanced resources\u201d and will be mentored by top senior software engineers working in global organisations like Twitter, Tesla, Gitlab, Amazon and Google.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, the program is necessary because up to 90% of TalentQL\u2019s clients want senior software engineers. Africa may have about 700,000 professional software developers but many are not experienced enough to meet global demand.\n\nThat\u2019s a familiar line for anyone who has followed Andela\u2019s story. Once the poster child of African tech for organising bootcamps that churned out junior developers at no initial cost, Andela hit the reality-check button in September 2019.\n\nFor a period of nine months to May 2020, Andela laid off more than 500 junior to mid level developers as they trimmed down to focus on senior talent. They have now expanded their talent pool to include Latin America to more ably serve the senior talent need that Africa alone cannot solve.\n\nOn one hand, TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline is a welcome plan to plug the experience gap in Africa by upskilling mid-level engineers. Yusuf insists Pipeline isn\u2019t for juniors \u2013 while the likes of Decagon and Semicolon serve as entry points for novices.\n\nTalentQL\u2019s promise with the program is that those who participate can expect to gain skills that will make them highly valued by employers. In addition to technical competence, Pipeline participants will be taught important soft skills.\n\nTheir mission comes from a good place but will it work?\n\nSenior developers are not a monolith\n\nTo get a sense of what to expect from Pipeline, I asked Sheriff Shittu, who runs a platform for developers seeking jobs, for his thoughts. His first inquiry was to know if the intensive program will involve live projects.\n\nWhile a training can make developers more knowledgeable, it may not immediately translate to experience and readiness for senior roles.\n\nBut \u201cif I work on high-impact fast live projects, my growth will be faster than someone who lets on select projects for two years,\u201d Shittu says.\n\nFor a senior developer at a Nigerian fintech, these four pillars are necessary for maturity: communication, problem solving, mentorship abilities, and ownership.\n\n\u201cI have been a good communicator from day one of my job, but my problem-solving abilities were not as good as they are now. If you become good at solving problems independently then you can take ownership.\u201d\n\nDoes he think Pipeline\u2019s six-month program will get mid-level devs to the senior ladder? \u201cIt depends, people are different.\u201d\n\nInviting similar upskilling initiatives\n\nKeeping both options in view, it is possible for TalentQL to achieve its purpose with this program if it meets a threshold for practicality and participants can meaningfully accelerate their communication and problem solving expertise.\n\nThe other implication is that Pipeline won\u2019t be open to just any mid-level engineer who has worked for three years. There will be a screening process to choose only those who want to \u201cmake the jump to become Senior Software Developers,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\nAdewale Yusuf, TalentQL\u2019s founder\n\nWhich, as you may have deduced, means that solving Africa\u2019s shortage of senior developers will require more than one training of this sort.\n\nDecagon, which aims to train 10,000 developers in 10 years, currently graduates about 100 juniors a year from its campus. It is reasonable to expect a lower figure from TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline.\n\nYet, it could be a valuable experiment for the ecosystem in training senior developers.\n\nIt is a free program that hopes to get returns when participants find senior work; that might be a questionable tactic seeing it didn\u2019t work for Andela. But the justification here is that there is enough demand to absorb people who graduate.\n\nIf that proves to be true, it won\u2019t be long before competitors arise to get a share of the Pipeline pie.",

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Twitter has revealed plans to roll out Birdwatch as part of its efforts to combat misinformation on the platform.\n\nThe social media platform informed users in a tweet that they might see Tweets with Birdwatch notes across all devices.\n\nThe new feature, which is only available to a few pilot participants, requires users to add notes that provide more information to misleading tweets. A pilot version of the product was launched in January, with the social media giant calling it a community-based approach to misinformation.\n\nFinally, if all notes on a Tweet are \u201cCurrently not rated helpful,\u201d there won\u2019t be a card on the Tweet. You\u2019ll still be able to get to Birdwatch notes on that Tweet by clicking on the Birdwatch icon in the Tweet details page. pic.twitter.com/Ubf8qeAWxS Advertisement June 2, 2021\n\nIn a blog post explaining the new feature, Twitter\u2019s VP of Product, Keith Coleman, stated that the move was to \u201cbroaden the range of voices\u201d tackling misinformation.\n\nHow does Birdwatch work?\n\nThe Birdwatch feature comes with two notes: currently rated helpful and currently not rated helpful. Consequently, users can rate tweets displayed as the former to elevate the most helpful ones.\n\nHowever, if all notes on the tweet are currently rated not helpful, there won\u2019t be a card on the tweet, and users can still access the feature on that tweet by clicking on the icon.\n\nThe big picture\n\nJust last month, Facebook announced a new feature that would prompt users to read articles they intend to share. Twitter also released a similar feature last year that reminded users to read articles they were about to retweet.\n\nFacebook has also used the services of its Oversight Board to combat misleading information on the platform, with the board upholding Donald Trump\u2019s ban last month. Twitter\u2019s decision to launch Birdwatch is a different approach from Facebook\u2019s as it lets users decide.\n\nIt seems social media platforms are finally getting serious about combating misinformation but having released several features in the past with varying degrees of success; the jury is still out on these efforts.\n\nWhat should be the role of social media platforms?\n\nIn January, following tweets by former US President, Donald Trump, supporters of the president stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the election. Twitter subsequently suspended the President\u2019s account over claims that it incited violence.\n\nThis week, Twitter deleted a tweet by Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, in which he referred to the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like in Donald Trump\u2019s case, the move has faced criticism from different quarters. Critics see such interventions as a gag on free speech, although most social media platforms pride themselves as proponents of free expression.\n\nAs Top10VPN reports, sub-Saharan Africa lost $2.16 billion from the Internet or social media shutdowns in 2019. This could have severe economic repercussions.\n\nOn the other hand, victims of online abuse have consistently called on social media platforms to be proactive in combating issues, such as racism, which are frequently perpetrated on these platforms. In April, the English Premier League (EPL) organised a social media blackout to protest online abuse directed at players.\n\nAs social media platforms become more powerful, the question about whose responsibility it is to check abuse remains. Should governments be tasked with this responsibility, or should the platforms reserve that right?",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Siltech produces electric vehicles, for a clean and elegant Africa",
          "text": "Africa\u2019s automotive sector has had its share of challenges over the years. Despite the well documented harmful effects of carbon emissions on our environment, petrol engines in cars, bikes, and heavy-duty vehicles rule most roads across the globe in 2021.\n\nHowever, companies in more developed countries are embracing clean energy solutions.\n\nTesla, founded by serial entrepreneur, Elon Musk, is one of the world\u2019s most popular electric vehicle manufacturers. Lesser-known companies like Rimac also make Roadsters.\n\nDespite making some important strides, African companies sorely lag behind their global counterparts where renewable energy is concerned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, some African startups and entrepreneurs are taking the bull by the horn. Indigenous companies like Nord and Asian companies like Hyundai have been delving into the technology for the Nigerian market.\n\nSo far, it has been difficult to achieve improved adoption of electric vehicles. But a certain Nigerian entrepreneur is taking a gradual approach to cleantech for transportation.\n\nTolulope Williams is a legal practitioner who loves tech, toys, motorbiking, and travelling. And in the late 2000s, he made several trips to Asia.\n\nTolulope Williams, CEO of Savenhart Investment Limited Technologies (Siltech)\n\nWilliams visited several trade fairs, and a trend caught his attention; he saw several innovations and captivating technologies based on clean energy. The bike lover in Williams came to the fore as he decided to purchase an electric bike which he brought back home to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to be a biker, as well. I always wanted to be a biker. But, I didn\u2019t think I had the time to ride or maintain a petrol engine. So, using an electric bike, I realised like, maintenance is way easier, and it\u2019s user friendly,\u201d says Williams\n\nMost Nigerian roads are notoriously bad and ridden with potholes, usually a nightmare for drivers, commuters, or any traveller, regardless of the vehicles they use.\n\nIn 2018, The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 39,802 road traffic fatalities occurred annually in Nigeria. This means over 105 people die from road crashes daily in Nigeria. Besides notoriously bad roads, the country also has a history of epileptic power supply. The World Bank also reports that in 2018, 56.5% of the country\u2019s population had access to electricity.\n\nWilliam\u2019s decision to bring an electric bike to Nigeria could naturally raise the question, who buys an electric bike in Asia with better roads and stable power and brings it to Nigeria? Well, someone as passionate about clean and awesome looking technology as Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Nigeria with his bike, he discovered that the vehicle\u2019s suspension wasn\u2019t good enough for local roads since it was made for European and Asian markets with better roads.\n\nTolu Williams\u2019 first electric bike. Its suspension, while being good for Asian and European roads, could not survive Nigerian roads. So he had to tweak it. Today it stands as a monument at the Siltech office in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nWilliams decided to do something about it, and that decision took him on a journey that birthed Savenhart Investment Limited Technology (Siltech), a renewable energy transportation technology company, in 2012.\n\nBeing a lawyer by trade with no formal technology training, passion was all he had to go on.\n\n\u201cLaw really wasn\u2019t my passion, to be honest. If you knew me from a young age and came to my room, you would see toy cars arranged everywhere. I\u2019d arrange things like spaceships; I wouldn\u2019t throw them away, I\u2019d just try and make something out of them.\u201d\n\nWilliams reveals that he had to learn on the job, and he slowly began to understand the fundamentals of electric vehicles, from two-wheelers to three to four-wheelers.\n\nBefore long, Williams could fix the suspensions, increase the battery capacity, and improve the motor controllers on the electric bike he bought.\n\nWilliams says he was proud of the attention and the puzzled glances he got when using the sleek bike with an irregularly positioned engine.\n\nSoon after, people around him began to take interest. Ezra Olubi, Co-founder and CTO of Nigerian fintech startup, Paystack, then a neighbour of his, saw him riding on his street and wanted one for himself.\n\nBuilding a business from a hobby\n\nAfter this, Williams realised that he could start a business, and Savenhart Investment Limited Technologies (Siltech) was born. However, passion and creativity alone would not cut it this time. So he plunged himself into more training and figured out other significant aspects of his business.\n\n\u201cYeah, there was a lot of YouTube, and I also did a lot of schooling in Asia as well. Some training courses with the EV companies I was working with,\u201d Williams recounts.\n\n\u201cI then realised that the key to all this is really the suppliers. It\u2019s getting the right chain of suppliers and ensuring you have the right warranty for all these kinds of technologies.\u201d\n\nWilliams also had to consider safety issues and ensure that the products coming into the Nigerian market were of the right quality.\n\n\u201cSo, in doing that, we created a robust after-sale service, and really became very, very technically sound on all the products and actually started improving them, and working with suppliers over there to create products solely for this market.\u201d\n\nWith Siltech coming to life, there was a bit of a talent hurdle to cross. Electric vehicle production is not exactly taught in Nigerian schools or regular auto assembly and repair shops.\n\nWilliams explains that the company employs people with pre-existing knowledge of motorbikes and combustion engines and trains them to assemble and maintain electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe have about ten technical staff. And then, we also have other people in charge of other areas like marketing, international partnerships and communications, legal affairs, and all that,\u201d Williams says.\n\nFlexing creative muscles\n\nWith a quality team in place, Siltech can design some of its vehicles while tweaking those made by other manufacturers to fit the Nigerian market. William says it goes to great lengths to ensure quality.\n\n\u201cSo each of these products has been extremely well thought out and tested over quite a period in different terrains to ensure that it\u2019s something that people can use every day,\u201d he says.\n\nBut building vehicles at scale for the African market has been complex. Williams says getting vehicle parts has been a bit tricky as everything needs to be bespoke.\n\nSurprisingly, Williams doesn\u2019t believe power has been much of an issue as the company uses a battery swapping technology that allows for flexibility. Users can charge on an inverter, a small generator, or with regular power.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can charge your laptop and your mobile phone, you have access to charging life; you can charge your electric bike. You can go to your friend\u2019s house or a charge centre, and you can charge your battery for the same cost you charge your phone,\u201d he submits.\n\nIf you live in Lekki, Lagos, for example, depending on the size of the battery, some of the bikes can carry you around your locality. Others can take you from Lekki to Ikeja (a 46km ride). These bikes could go from Lagos to Ibadan (131km) with two or three swap stations.\n\nSome bikes can go as far as 46km on a single charge. About three battery swaps can take it on a 131km journey\n\nCurrent model\n\nThe Siltech Showroom, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nWilliams likes to describe Siltech as the church of eMobility in Africa. The company has a showroom in Lagos, Nigeria, where people can walk in to make purchases and a website and an Instagram page for people to order online.\n\nThe company runs distribution centres in Abuja and Port Harcourt, where there has been a high demand. Williams reveals that compared to previous years, the company sold more vehicles in 2020 and Q1 2021; he believes the increase in sales was because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cFewer people were moving, and there were fewer vehicles on the roads. I believe that got people to be more conscious of the environment and the impact petrol engines were having,\u201d Williams says.\n\nThis perceived adoption of clean energy in Nigeria is symbolic of a larger global sentiment. Tesla shares added $14 trillion in value at the height of the pandemic. In 2020, the Nigerian government announced the Hyundai-Kona, a made-in-Nigeria electric vehicle.\n\nSo far, the company has not received any form of funding, and it runs mainly on the sales and distribution of its vehicles.\n\n\u201cSo we always reinvest in the business. With everything that has been happening, we just continue reinvesting in the customisation of the technology for this market has been the main focus.\u201d\n\nBesides electric vehicle sales, the company also runs consultancy projects for companies looking to delve into clean energy vehicles. Williams was the Head, E-Mobility for Nigerian mobility startup, MAX.ng, and he reveals that one of Siltech\u2019s prototypes gave birth to the MAX E Series 1.\n\nThe Max E Series 1 prototype, one of the first electric bikes used by a mobility startup in Africa.\n\nThey\u2019ve taken the consulting project a step further, acting as consultants for security companies and oil companies looking to employ clean and silent electric bikes for their operations.\n\n\u201cWe launched our e-security, Silent Patrol Systems, a very successful security company. Right now, we\u2019re leading consultants for one of the top security firms that have electric vehicles deployed all around the estates that they\u2019re guarding.\u201d\n\nSilent Patrol vehiles used by Security firms in some estates in Lagos, Nigeria\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also focused on agriculture as well. So we have utility vehicles that pull load as well. We\u2019re also focused on refineries. You know, there\u2019s a limit to what combustion engines can do in the oil and gas industry, and most of these complexes are very, very big,\u201d he adds.\n\nGathering a decent community of users, Williams believes more adoption would reduce the number of cars and bikes on Nigerian roads.\n\nBut how much does it cost?\n\nOn average, Siltech\u2019s bikes cost around \u20a6700k (or $1,700). Not the kind of money for the average salary earner in Nigeria. Thankfully, it allows for payment plans for low salary earners.\n\n\u201cWe have the option for three months, six months, and then twelve months.\u201d\n\nHowever, even on a 12-month payment plan, these EVs would cost \u20a658k ($141) and might be a little expensive for people earning \u20a6100k ($243). It will also be way more than Nigeria\u2019s \u20a630k ($73) minimum wage which most Nigerians live on.\n\nWilliams promises that the company will make much cheaper vehicles that low salary earners can afford.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFourwheel cart is produced by Lights-Quad-Karts \u2014 an Abeokuta-based cart manufacturer. This will form the prototype for the Roadster, which could be Nigeria\u2019s first electric car\n\nWilliams embraces anyone working in the e-mobility space and does not treat them as a competitor. However, he argues that Siltech\u2019s years of experience gives it an edge over most players.\n\n\u201cIn terms of competition, I think it\u2019s a big advantage. Anybody who would want to enter the e-mobility market would want to talk to Siltech about it.\n\n\u201cReleasing any product in Nigeria is not easy because of the different things that we have. And we\u2019ve already overcome that, so now we just want to sell. We are not testing our products in the market. Our products have been tested and refined through the years,\u201d Williams states.\n\nSiltech also plans to launch battery swap stations across the country in the coming months. The pilot will be at Victoria Island before moving to Lekki, GRA, and other areas in Lagos.\n\nAccording to Williams, the launch will serve as the template for the expansion to other Nigerian cities.\n\nMost exciting, perhaps, is the company\u2019s plan to launch Nigeria\u2019s very first Roadster before the end of the year through its partnership with Lights-Quad-Karts \u2014 an Abeokuta-based cart manufacturer.",

          "text": "Nigerian banks access low-cost funds from individual/corporate deposits, interventions from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and development finance institutions but lend same to customers at higher rate.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) pay customers an average interest rate of 1.15 percent for saving with them but lend to customers at an average rate of 18 percent for prime lending and average rate of 30 percent for maximum lending, according to applicable rates for each of the DMBs as of May 14, 2021, published on the CBN\u2019s website.\n\nA publication by the CBN, themed \u2018Bullion,\u2019 noted that 2019 started with the industry weighted average prime lending rate (PLR) and maximum lending rate (MLR) as high as 16.01 percent and 30.48 percent, respectively.\n\nAverage saving rate for the industry during the period was 4.07 percent. By the end of April 2019, the PLR and the MLR spiked and climaxed at 18.23 and 30.89 percent.\n\nAstonishingly, the average saving rate fell to 3.91 percent, according to a study titled, \u2018An Appraisal of CBN Temporary Credit Initiatives: An exploratory Analysis,\u2019 written by Baba Yaaba.\n\nThis implies that while the cost of funds to banks was declining, lending rate was on the rise. This disparity was a clear signal of exploitation by the banks, which is no doubt unfriendly to growth, the publication stated.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian banks lend to customers at higher rate despite cheap funds\n\nResponding to the development, Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, says the main reason lending rate will be high is because of rates in the interbank and financial markets.\n\n\u201cRates are in double digits, hence no incentive to create risk assets that come with various risks. To take the risk, then must come with a premium,\u201d Ebo states.\n\nThe Overnight (O/N) inter-bank rate, which is the rate at which DMBs borrow and lend to one another, increased by 2.17 percent to close at 14.83 percent on Wednesday as against the last close of 12.66 percent on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, the Open Buy Back (OBB) rate, the money market instrument used to raise short-term capital, increased by 2.33 percent to close at 14.33 percent from 12 percent on the previous day.\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN increased the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to 60 percent, which led to private sector credit expansion by 3.46 percent to 2.11 percent at the end of July 2019 from -1.36 percent in June.\n\nThe trend continued until it climaxed at 13.57 percent at the end of the year. Arising from the adjustment in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to 27.5 percent in January 2020, however, the private sector credit moderated to 12.57 percent.\n\nAs of fourth quarter of 2020, banks credit to the private sector rose by 2.56 percent to N20.37 trillion, the year that was bedevilled by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) banking sector report released on April 2021 showed that total value of credit allocated by the bank stood at N20.37 trillion as of Q4 2020. Oil & Gas and Manufacturing sectors got credit allocation of N3.93 trillion and N3.19 trillion to record the highest credit allocation as at the period under review.\n\nThe reason for growth in banks\u2019 loan book was as a result of the implementation of the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy of the CBN.",

Hon. Francis Okiye, for being absent from the House proceedings for the mandatory 181 days.\n\nThe governor, reacting to calls to pardon the erring Assembly members-elect during an interactive session with stakeholders from Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other civil society groups, called for the support of all stakeholders towards achieving lasting peace and development in Edo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome characters said they sent congratulatory letters to me and put it in all kinds of conditions.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell me to forgive those 14 lawmakers-elect who are responsible for sedition and treason in Nigeria?

We have gotten support from all of you and are very glad and happy; your support gives us the confidence to continue to fight.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, we are open. There is nothing that we are hiding and this is why we have to kill anything that links us to godfatherism. We have killed it at the national level and need to kill it locally as it is everywhere. I urge you to please be activists for good, peace and development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis engagement is to see how we can collaborate and make things work differently; this is a time that we need leadership more than ever before,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of NLC in Edo State, Mr. Sunday Osanyande, urged the government to digitize revenue collection by migrating to e-revenue collection systems, which will check leakages.\n\nOsanyande said that the e-revenue collection system would further increase the state government Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).\n\n...",

Let us build strong institutions and not individuals. The buildings are there; people have come and gone.\n\n\u201cLet us begin to think of government that way.

          "text": "For three consecutive years, Michael Okon Enyong, the lawmaker representing Ibesikpo Asutan/Nsit Arai/Uruan/Uyo Federal Constituency of Akwa Ibom State, nominated the construction of a three-classroom block for a sum of N56 million in a school, which a PREMIUM TIMES investigation has found not to be in existence.\n\nIn 2018, N30 million was budgeted for the construction of the phantom classroom block at Community Secondary School, Oku, Uyo. In 2019 and 2020, N13 million was allotted each year for the construction of the block in the same school.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES cannot ascertain if funds budgeted for the project were released and to whom.\n\nThe project was originally assigned to the Council of Nigerian Mining Engineers and Geoscience (COMEG). Then in 2019 and 2020, it was assigned to the Federal College of Veterinary and Medical Laboratory technology, in Vom, Plateau State, under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development.\n\nProject not found; school non-existent\n\nA visit by Premium Times to Oku Uyo in Akwa Ibom State, revealed that neither the school nor the block of classrooms exists. Oku is one of the four clans in Uyo Local Government Area and spans 14 villages and residents of the community told this reporter that no school with such a name exists in the area.\n\n\u201cI am from this clan and I grow (sic) up here. I have never seen that kind of name of school in Uyo,\u201d said Akpan Nsikak, a resident.\n\nThis reporter visited other government secondary schools in the local government in his quest to locate the school.\n\n\u201cThis is Four Towns and not the school you are looking for. I\u2019ve never heard of it. We don\u2019t have any project of that kind here. You can check the school at Ikot Okubo,\u201d Aniedi Essien, principal of Community Comprehensive Secondary School, Four Towns Uyo, told this reporter.\n\n\u201cThis place is Offot and not Oku,\u201d a female teacher adds. \u201cThe only government secondary school in that Oku is the CCC Girls\u2019 School in Afaha Oku (Cornelia Connelly College), the other ones are primary schools.\u201d\n\nThe school, Community Secondary School Oku Uyo, was also missing on the list of government secondary schools in Uyo Local Government Area, provided by the Akwa Ibom State Secondary Education Board.\n\nIf it was released in full, the N56 million allocated to the phantom school would have gone a long way towards solving Akwa Ibom educational problems.\n\nThe state lags behind most states in the country in educational development. A 2019 report by the Federal Ministry of Education, ranked Akwa Ibom as one of the states with the highest out-of-school children with 581,800 children, only behind Kano State.\n\nThe report jointly prepared by the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), National Population Commission, and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) pegged the total number of out-of-school children in Nigeria at 10,193,918.\n\nThe construction of the classroom blocks, had it been assigned to a real school, would have supplemented crumbling infrastructure and reduced overcrowding in classrooms, which are common features of public schools in the state, according to a PREMIUM TIMES report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA 2020 PREMIUM TIMES investigation revealed how constituency projects in Kwara Central were filling the infrastructural gaps in public school education created by poor funding, following the inability of the state government to access the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) funding.\n\nProject outside purview of \u2018implementing agencies\u2019\n\nAnother curious observation in the allocation of the N56 million was that the project was placed under the supervision of agencies that have zero correlation or proximity to the school.\n\nSituated in Vom, Jos, the Plateau State capital, the Federal College of Veterinary & Medical Laboratory Technology specialises in the training of middle-level manpower in the diagnosis of human and animal diseases, to become medical laboratory scientists, technicians, and assistants.\n\nThe Council of Nigerian Mining Engineers and Geoscience (COMEG) is the regulatory body for all professionals in the fields of geosciences, mining engineering, and metallurgy and firms in the extractive in Nigeria. It was established in September 2000.\n\nBoth institutions have no direct relationship with Akwa Ibom State nor secondary education.\n\nBoth institutions did not reply to requests sent to them for comments about the project such as the amount disbursed and the identities of the contractors the project was allocated to.\n\nMore questions as lawmaker reacts\n\nWhen contacted at the constituency office in Uyo, Anny Michaels, media aide to Mr Enyong, said he was not aware of the project but promised to reach the Senator\u2019s office in Abuja to confirm and revert.\n\nA few days later, Mr Michaels called to say no such project was facilitated by the Senator.\n\n\u201cI got a response from the office in Abuja. They said there is no project like that in Community Secondary School Uyo. I just spoke with the senator\u2019s legislative aide. He has checked and said there is none,\u201d Mr Michaels said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there is no school like that in Uyo. I have also asked a colleague here who is from Uyo and he confirmed that the only schools in Oku are the CCC School and the Primary School Ikot Ntuen Oku.\u201d",

Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (\u201cIRS-CI\u201d), have announced the arrest of a Nigerian, Charles Onus for charges in connection with a scheme to conduct cyber intrusions of multiple user accounts maintained by a company that provides human resources and payroll services to employers across the United States, in order to steal payroll deposits.\n\nOnus, 34, according a statement published on the website of the US Justice Department, was previously arrested on April 14, 2021, in San Francisco and detained, and he will be presented later in Manhattan federal court before Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, according to the statement, said: \u201cCharles Onus allegedly participated in a scheme that stole nearly $1 million by hacking into a payroll processing company\u2019s system to access user accounts and divert payroll to prepaid debit cards he controlled. As alleged, Onus did this as effectively as someone who commits bank burglary, but with no need for a blowtorch or bolt-cutters. Thanks to the FBI and IRS-CI, Onus is in custody and facing serious federal charges.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: \u201cCyber intrusions ripple through everything our society relies upon \u2013 this one impacted people\u2019s paychecks. The FBI\u2019s goal is to prevent cyber criminals from causing harm and holding them accountable, but we can\u2019t do it alone. Companies need to continuously improve their cyber hygiene and awareness. Taking steps like training the workforce to protect and frequently change passwords, and to use different login credentials across platforms, can have an impact. Each one of us, from the individual citizen to the biggest corporation, plays a critical role in defending the nation from cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nIRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jonathan D. Larsen said: \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation will always work with our law enforcement partners to track down those who try to breach our country\u2019s tax and financial infrastructure. We will continually endeavor to bring to justice criminals who think they can comfortably steal from victims in America while hiding behind their computer screens.\u201d\n\nAccording to Justice Department, from at least in or about July 2017 through at least in or about 2018, Onus participated in a scheme to conduct cyber intrusions of multiple user accounts maintained by a company that provides human resources and payroll services to employers across the United States (the \u201cCompany\u201d), in order to steal payroll deposits processed by the Company.\n\nDuring the course of the scheme, unauthorized access was obtained to over 5,500 Company user accounts through a cyber intrusion technique referred to as \u201ccredential stuffing.\u201d During a credential stuffing attack, a cyber threat actor collects stolen credentials, or username and password pairs, obtained from other large-scale data breaches of other companies, the statement said.\n\nThe threat actor then systematically attempts to use those stolen credentials to obtain unauthorized access to accounts held by the same user with other companies and providers, to compromise accounts where the user has maintained the same password.\n\nAfter ONUS successfully gained unauthorized access to a Company user account, he changed the bank account information designated by the user of the account so that ONUS would receive the user\u2019s payroll to a prepaid debit card that was under ONUS\u2019s control.\n\nFrom at least in or about July 2017 through at least in or about 2018, at least approximately 5,500 Company user accounts were compromised and more than approximately $800,000 in payroll funds were fraudulently diverted to prepaid debit cards, including those under the control of ONUS. The compromised Company user accounts were associated with employers whose payroll was processed by the Company, including employers located in the Southern District of New York.\n\nOnus, a resident and national of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, was charged with one count of computer fraud for causing damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of computer fraud for unauthorized access to a protected computer to further intended fraud, and one count of receipt of stolen money, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\n\nMs. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and IRS-CI. Ms. Strauss also thanked the New York City Police Department, the FBI New York Cyber Task Force, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the FBI Field Office in San Francisco for their assistance in the investigation of this case.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Sagar K. Ravi is in charge of the prosecution, the Justice Department concluded.",

          "title": "How Dave Umahi became enemy of Ebonyi people, By Abia Onyike",
          "text": "\u201cAll ambitions are lawful except those which climb upwards on the miseries of mankind\u2019\u2019. Joseph Conrad(1857-1924).\n\nIn the beginning:\n\nSaturday, the 29th day of May, 2021 marked the 6th anniversary of Gov. David Nweze Umahi\u2019s ascendancy into the Government House as the 3rd democratically elected Governor of Ebonyi state. The six years has been a horrible period in the life of Ebonyians. Visitors and foreigners who pass through Abakaliki or those who visit the Governor often tell stories about how the state has become an Eldorado or a bed of roses. Well, Umahi\u2019s 419 government may have deceived some people but he has merely succeeded in declaring himself the enemy of Ebonyi people based on the cumulative anti-people policies of his highly authoritarian and self-serving administration.\n\nThe people of Ebonyi state after six years of Umahi\u2019s fake leadership, have come to the realisation that he was merely after his pocket and the welfare of his family members. He is a man without central values. After he noticed that Ebonyians have deserted him, he threw caution to the winds and started behaving like a loose canon. He descended on the worthy leaders of the state- the same people who made him Governor in 2015. In 2014, as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Anyim Pius Anyim was instrumental to making things easier for Umahi to emerge as Governor of Ebonyi state. Anyim introduced him to some \u2018oracles\u2019 of economic and political power. The resources for his election was provided for him. And as the countdown to the 2015 Governorship elections gathered momentum, Umahi confided in some people that he needed the faces of people like Dr. Sam Egwu, the former Governor of the state to shore up his credibility to be able to win the election.\n\nUmahi then needed a sanctuary because the former Governor Chief Martin Elechi, whom Umahi served under as Deputy Governor(2011-2015) had described him as being \u201cworse than an armed robber\u2019\u2019 at the Abakaliki Township Stadium during a rally.\n\nUmahi fell out out of favour with Elechi. Today, Umahi has jumped ship and decamped from PDP to APC. Finding himself on a lonely road as the top PDP leaders in the state refused to follow him on his latest misadventure, Umahi declared war on them. He first accused them last year of being supporters of IPOB and now because the Ebonyi state members of the National Assembly raised alarm about the way Gov. Umahi was wrongly deploying the EbubeAgu Regional Security outfit to intimidate and threaten his real and imagined political opponents, Umahi reported them to the AIG Zone 9 who was at Government House Abakaliki on courtesy call.\n\nHe told the Police Chief to arrest the listed leaders of PDP and accused them of being behind the recent upsurge of criminal and violent crimes in the state. That was the height of cheap blackmail and abuse of official privilege and potrays Umahi as someone lacking in political maturity. He is someone who can sell his people for a pot of porridge and he may be willing to become the nemesis of his own people. Umahi displayed his inherent anarchic tendency. He is fond of threatening those who disagree with him on political issues. Sometimes he threatens to \u2018crush\u2019 and \u2018grind\u2019 them. For Umahi to do what he is doing now to Sen. Sam Egwu shows that he is a politician without pedigree. He is merely an upstart and a shameless opportunist.\n\n2. Gov. Umahi\u2019s tragedy of Populism: Administrative Recklessness, Grand Deceit and Massive Corruption.\n\nGov. Umahi wanted to package himself as a Messiah of sorts, a God-sent hero. But his love for money created terrible contradictions for the system he presides over. He is not a foundational man nor a pathfinder. Tyrants are worse than wicked men. And the Mammon spirit is the demonic drive behind all dictatorships in history. The Bible says that \u201c\u2026 the love of money is the root of all evil\u2019\u2019(1 Timothy 6:10). It is such fake populism that may have led him to desecrate the rules of the civil service, so as to be seen as a redeemer and charismatic leader- one who builds numerous cement roads without bitumen; and uses hand vibrators instead of modern vibrators to construct/compact roads, thereby leading to frequent road repairs.\n\nBut populism has its tragedy in politics. It can bring about abuse of people\u2019s basic rights and personality cultism where the leader sees himself as all-knowing. That is certainly Umahi\u2019s problem today. It is the problem of mediocre populism which has failed to anchor because of the prebendalism exhibited by the pseudo leader. Dr. Chuba Okadigbo referred to such characters like Umahi as \u201cpocket-size Napoleons and mid-night Hitlers,\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi\u2019s government has become a disaster in the state. He does not tolerate any form of criticism, whether constructive or otherwise. He perceives himself as King Herod who must rule as he likes without recourse to the feelings of the people or the rules of engagement for public officers. That was why he beheaded the state civil service on assumption of office in 2015 and emasculated the Trade Unions/House Unions, through deliberate but illegitimate/illegal factionalization, bordering on barefaced tyranny, fraud, authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It was an act of micro treasonable felony for an elected officer to apply political hooliganism in undermining the rules of the civil service. He was the only Governor in Nigeria to have ruled his state without Permanent Secretaries from 2015 to 2019. He sacked the Perm Secs he inherited from the previous administration and refused to appoint new ones. The implication is that all the monies appropriated by Umahi in the four years under review in those Ministries, Departments and Agencies without Permanent Secretaries (Accounting Officers of the Ministries) have to be refunded by him because what he did amounted to misappropriation of public funds.\n\nIt is the worst form of systemic corruption in the history of Nigeria\u2019s public service. The practice of having Permanent Secretaries was never violated by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. M.I. Okpara(pioneer Premiers of Eastern Region, Dr. Akanu Ibiam(pioneer Governor of Eastern Region), Col.Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu(Military Governor of Eastern Region), Chief Sam Mbakwe (Governor of Old Imo state), Chief Jim Nwobodo(Governor, old Anambra state), Chief C.C.Onoh(Governor, old Anambra state), Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu( Governor, old Abia state), Commander Walter Aye Feghabor(first Military Administrator, Ebonyi state),AIG of Police Simeon Oduoye(Military Governor, Ebonyi state), Dr.Sam Ominyi Egwu(first civilian Governor, Ebonyi state and Chief Martin Elechi(second civilian Governor of Ebonyi state).\n\nThe duty of the Perm Secs is to advise the Commissioners about the rules of the service, but Umahi hated such advice. Of all these leaders, military and civilian, Umahi is the only one with the temerity to lynch and violate the conservative rules of the civil service. But the time when he must pay for it will come by 2023 when he leaves office and loses his immunity. Chief Sam Mbakwe worked with some of the most seasoned, charismatic, influential and powerful Perm Secs in history, such as S.C.A Nwapa, Francis Oji, G.C Okezie, N.C Okoronkwo, A.E.N Izuwa, Friday Okengwu, I.D Nwoga, Kele Okereke etc. and still emerged as the best Igbo Governor of his generation. His picture hangs elegantly in the \u201cIgbo Hall of Fame\u2019\u2019 with the pictures of other Igbo pioneers/pathfinders in the same place such as Olauda Equano, King Jaja of Opobo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Aguiyi Ironsi, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Chinua Achebe, Keneth Onwuka Dike, Eni Njoku, Z.C.Obi, Philip Emeagwali etc. For the Governors of the present republic, only three have been shortlisted for the Igbo Hall of Fame. They are Peter Obi, Sam Egwu and Achike Udenwa. One of them will be eventually picked after several years of thorough scrutiny. Umahi can never be allowed to come near the hall because trickstars are not worthy of such honours.\n\nAzikiwe\u2019s father, as at 1902 was already a trained teacher in Asaba. In 1903, he moved to Bonny where he met Lord Fredrick Lugard and followed him to Kano. Lugard appointed him his Secretary. They went to Zungeru where Nnamdi Azikiwe was born in 1904. From Zungeru they went to Calabar and by 1st January, 1914 they arrived Tinubu Square, Lagos to execute the historic Amalgamation of Nigeria. Then Ojukwu\u2019s father attended the Hope Waddel Training Institution(established in 1895) at a time when there were only eight secondary schools in Nigeria. He joined the Eastern Region Department of Agriculture and later left for John Holt where he was employed as a Sales Clerk. He resigned from there to set up Ojukwu Transport Company and later became the pioneer business mogul in Nigeria and first Director-General of Nigerian Stock Exchange and by the 1950s was Africa\u2019s first multi- billionaire. So, if their children, Emeka Ojukwu and Nnamdi Azikiwe with their powerful parentage, fame and high education could work with Perm Secs, why should some characters come from the pit of illiteracy to hold people to ransome in Ebonyi state? Infact the non-use or non-appointment of Permanent Secretaries is a violation of Section 208 of the Nigerian constitution. Umahi should examine the Circulars from the National Income and Wages Commission on the Appointment of Perm Secs to determine the amount to be refunded in respect of the first four years of his administration, from 2015-2019.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet issued by the Association of Concerned Ebonyi Citizens in Diaspora(ACECID), Vol.1, titled \u201c The Iron Fist of Poverty and Autocracy in Ebonyi State: Discovering Dave Umahi: His Deeds, Misdeeds, Truths and Untruths\u2019\u2019, \u201c Forget about the cosmetics, the decorations, bling bling lights and plastic Christmas trees\u2026mounting neon-lights and casting of concrete as a cover to retire billions into private pockets. What we are witnessing is gross maladministration, grand lacerny, callousness, cold heartedness, autocratic indifference to the sufferings that has endangered abject poverty and dehumanization upon the people of Ebonyi state.\u201d\n\nThe report went further to assert that: \u201cUmahi\u2019s authocratic personalization of power and needless privatization of state assets and resources to himself has played a perfect symphony of power grab, imperial domination and swagger. Vulgarity is the very definition of his style. He wants to remain the only man standing and towering above a rotten pile of poverty, suffering and helplessness.\u201d\n\nGov.Umahi\u2019s enemity with Ebonyi people was caused by himself. He embarked on four useless and wasteful projects worth billions of naira probably for siphoning funds into private pockets while the citizens wallowed in poverty. The projects include the new Government House project at Ochudo, the Ecumenical Centre, the Shopping Mall and the on-going construction of about a dozen flyovers in the state. Other useless and wasteful projects include the hotel building infront of Abakaliki Township stadium at Kpirikpiri which is still unoccupied several years after it was completed.\n\nUmahi spent huge sums of money renovating the Governor\u2019s residence in the old Government House, but suddenly came up with the idea of building a new Government House. This decision was considered very strange because the old Government House had no problem, it was located on top of a hill with a lake and with the headquarters of the Nigerian Police opposite it. What was Umahi looking for in Ochudo? The old Government Houses in Enugu, Umuahia and Owerri are still where the colonial authorities located them. The White House in Washingston DC in the United States is still standing where it was located 200 years ago. The problem with Umahi is that he has been running government since 2015 without any known seasoned Administrator by his side.\n\nIn fact he hates such people because he had made up his mind to run a lawless administration where looting can be made easy since there can be no in-built checks and balances. In 2015, before he started building the Shopping Mall, three private sector players came forward and bidded to build the Mall with private sector funding. Umahi waved them aside and preffered to waste Ebonyi public funds to build it and now he is confused about what to do next after making his own money from the building aspect of the job. He is always good in buildings but very poor in administering or managing institutions or businesses. And that is why Ebonyians call him the cement Governor. An Ebonyian told me that Umahi knows what he is doing.\n\nAccording to him, Umahi\u2019s development concentrates on the area where he has comparative advantage, ie. where he is very conversant with. But that is not what governance is all about. Now Umahi has failed to understand that developmet is a multi-sectoral process with diverse sectors such as the Civil service sector, Local Government and Rural Development Sector, Water Resources sector, Health Sector, Education Sector, Agriculture Sector, Commerce and Industry Sector, Human Capital Development Sector, Culture and Tourism Sector etc. Umahi has concentrated on only one sector- Infrastructure sector. This is akin to a child who went for examination and the instruction given to him was to attempt all questions. The boy ignored the instruction and concentrated on one particular question which he knew the answers very well. No matter how well he does on that question, he can never pass the examination. This is why Umahi is jittery because he has exposed himself as unintelligent in governance. No single state hospital is working in Ebonyi state. There is no pipe borne water in Ebonyi but every year #3 billion is appropriated for water supplies. Scholarships have been banned since Umahi came into office and the primary and secondary schools are declining and decaying because of poor funding. Umahi\u2019s government does not pay retirees their gratuities. Civil servants in the state have been placed on half salary since he came into office and their leave allowances and other statutory entitlements have been banned. When they are promoted, it comes without financial benefit. What a wicked and roguish government.\n\nUmahi has stopped due process in award of contracts and all the Departmental Tenders Boards and Procurement Council have either been banned or are manipulated out of context. Umahi\u2019s Commissioners are always under pressure from Umahi to get things done according to his whims and caprices, while the Commissioners themselves are always on the neck of civil servants to keep violating the civil service rules through all kinds of political pressures and administrative brigandage. The Local Government system has been bastardized and despoliated because of the insatiable greed of an authoritarian ruler. Council Chairmen are given mere stipends which cannot enable them to run the councils at the grassroots. Development Centres have gone into reticence and extinction. Local governments in Ebonyi state have been paralysed as the staff are no longer needed by Umahi who has taken over local government functions by himself. And he prides himself as one of the great leaders of our time. One wonders what he has done to make him think so highly of himself. Umahi\u2019s government cannot be compared to that of Dr.Sam Egwu. Under Egwu, Ebonyians witnessed a humane administration, which impacted on the lives of the people positively. Egwu pioneered all the sectors of development simultaneously and never practised family nepotism .\n\nInfact, Egwu\u2019s younger ones were intellectually promising and non of them took up any political appointment during his tenure. They respected themselves and allowed their brother to run his government with dignity and decency. In fact one of Egwu\u2019s younger brothers, Joe Egwu, proceeded to the United States of America for his post-graduate studies immediately his elder brother was sworn-in as Governor. But the way the Umahis manifested their level of hunger and abandoned all they were doing to become state dependants is unheard of. Furthermore, Gov. Umahi is a perfidious albion. He is extremely vainglorious, vindictive, viscious, dilettante, sadistic, meretricious, cantankerous, covetious, unnecessarily restless and over-zealously self-centred. That is why he has antagonised himself with the people and there is no peace in the state. It was Martin Luther King who said that \u201cwhere there is no justice there can be no peace\u2019\u2019. And St. Augustine said that \u201cany regime devoid of justice is nothing but a gang of robbers\u2019\u2019. Gov.Umahi\u2019s divide and rule tactics is at the heart of the insecurity in the state, but he can never know it because he is not a student of conflict and does not know how social systems operate. Immediately there is breakdown of law and order or inter-communal disturbances any where, he will blame others and begin to remove and suspend his appointees or even call on the police to arrest people at random, including elder statesmen, because he sees himself as the Rock of Gibralter who can never be arrested or removed.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even know that the police are independent. Ebonyians are tired of Umahi\u2019s illiterate governance style but are only consoled that he has less than two years to go. The other day, Gov. Umahi sent words across to the people of Amagu in Abakaliki LGA who had concluded plans to celebrate their \u201cAmagu Day\u2019\u2019. The date was Saturday, 22nd May, 2021. The Community had planned to honour Sen. Sam Egwu, Rt. Hon. Sylvester Ogbaga and other distinguished sons and well-wishers of the community at the grand event. But Umahi the tyrant would have non of that. He sent a top politician from Izzi clan to go and warn the Traditional Institution there to stop any further preparations towards the event. He succeeded in scuttling it. He even threatened to seize their staff of office if they dared go against his directive.\n\nSometime last year, the Governor dethroned the Traditional Ruler of Nkalagu in Ishielu LGA and seized his official car from him. The Royal father was effectively deposed and replaced just because Sen.Obinna Ogba was showing interest in the 2023 governorship race and the Ezeogo was perceivrd to be close to Ogba. And even in the case of Amagu, we hear the target is Ogbaga for the same reason of showing guber interest. Is it not their right as citizens to aspire to any positions of their choice in a democratic system of government? What crime have they committed? Well, the main problem with Umahi is that he is loosing grip of Ebonyi state.\n\nWhen Sen.Ogba buried his father on 27th March, 2021, the ceremony witnessed the gathering of a mammoth crowd, with a galaxy of dignitaries which included serving and retired Governors, Ministers, Senators, House of Reps Members, Diplomats and others, headed by the number three citizen in Nigeria, the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan. Umahi could not attend the occasion for reasons best known to him. He missed out. Now he is afraid that such a grand gathering again at Amagu would finally send him out of reckoning. So he has devised a new method of stopping the gathering of the winning train in Ebonyi. He will soon get tired.\n\nThe ACECID pamphlet under review has documented that \u201cthe N12.7 billion Paris Club refund, N10 billion Infrastructure refund and $3million BESEDA fund were all in fixed deposit accounts\u2026\u2019\u2019. The report further states that \u201cN10 billion federal bailout fund; N8 billion loan from CBN on behalf of Ebonyi farmers over three years; $3 million BESDA fund; N24 billion from UBEB, N48 billion domestic loans, $65 million foreign loans, all stand unaccounted for\u201d. And Umahi is so secretive about public funds, which was why he appointed one of his cousins as the State Finance Commissioner.\n\nIn 2017, he imposed his brother as National Vice Chairman of the ruling party in the state ; another brother as the State Deputy Chairman of the party and yet another one as the defacto Attorney-General of the state. In 2015, when he became Governor, he quickly imposed his elder brother as the Traditional Ruler of his Community. As Chairman of South-East Governors Forum, he appointed his elder brother, Rtd. General Obi Umahi as the Chairman of South-East Security Advisory Committee. And now Austin Umahi, an unknown quantity has become Gov. Umahi\u2019s dreaded but shameless hatchetman/henchman.\n\nUmahi lacks the mental and psychological stability to run government independently unless his relations surround him. His level of nepotism is unprecedented. To further demonstrate his hawkish posturing, Gov. Umahi appeared on the SUNRISE morning programme of Channels Television station on 22nd April, 2021 where he called on security agents to arrest Nigerians who criticise government in the Social Media. Several human rihts groups lampooned him for the outburst. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project(SERAP), a Lagos based human rights group called him to order, emphasizing that citizens have a right to criticize government and to hold the rulers accountable.\n\nIn Ebonyi state it has become commonplace for Gov. Umahi to declare his critics \u2018wanted\u2019. Once you criticise him or you do what he does not like, he will start announcements on the sate radio station that you have been declared wanted. Those declared wanted by Umahi in the recent past include Ene Odi and Barr. Silas Joseph Onu(State Publicity Secretary of PDP). In my own case, when I criticised him on 9th June, 2020, he made a special radio broadcast declaring me a COVID-19 patient and ordered that security agents should ensure that I was isolated in my residence for two weeks. The then Director of DSS sheepishly obeyed him and came to my house with armed security people to enforce Umahi\u2019s illegal order.\n\n3. Ebonyi State Poverty Threshold under Gov. Umahi\n\nIn 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics rated Ebonyi state as one of the ten poorest states in Nigeria. The states are: Sokoto, Katsina, Adamawa, Gombe, Jigawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Kebbi and Zamfara. Ebonyi is actually the 7th poorest in Nigeria and the only state from Southern Nigeria in the list of poorest states. The report further stated that the factors responsible for the poverty were: bad government, unemployment and negligence of development priorities. These are actually the problems with Umahi. Infact a similar report released early this year indicates that Ebonyi state is the 3rd highest state in Nigeria in food inflation. Ebonyi\u2019s food inflation rating is 26.6%. Only Kogi (29.7%) and Sokoto(27%) surpass Ebonyi. Again, out of the three states mentioned, Ebonyi is the only one from Southern Nigeria.\n\nGov. Umahi\u2019s governance rating is terribly disastrous. Even with the lack of teachers in Ebonyi state schools, the last thing to suggest to Umahi is employment of teachers. Umahi preaches that people should go to private sector for employment, but he has destroyed the private sector in the state by seizing the market stalls of hundreds of traders who owned stalls in the old market.\n\nOut of frustration, majority of them, who are mainly non-indigenes are dying or suffering from strokes. Umahi has forgotten that the non-indigenes he is chasing about and maltreating were the same persons whose parents built up Abakaliki and made it stand as the capital of the state. Any time Gov.Umahi is asked a question regarding the terrible state of unemployment in the state, he begins to make disjointed and incoherent but deceptive statements, claiming that Ebonyi state is a huge construction site, how he built a shopping mall, international market and international airport to engage the youths. These are all balderdash(akuko ifo).\n\nHis recent fabrication claiming to have built the International Market is another fraud of the Umahi government. That market was built by Chief Martin Elechi, but Umahi\u2019s excessive greed could not allow him to hand it over to the Abakaliki Local Government who are the rightful owners/operators of the market. Umahi condescended from his Olympian height to personally seize the market, which is an aberration in the annals of governance in Nigeria. It is the responsibility of local governments to control markets but Umahi is all-knowing and can never let go. Even the sophisticated Onitsha Market, the biggest business emporium in West Africa, built by Drs Nnamdi Azikiwe and M.I.Okpara is run by Onitsha South LG. Umahi\u2019s brazen take-over of the constitutional responsibilities of the Local Governments was made possible through the selection(election) of pliable and surrogate characters as Council Chairmen in the state.\n\nGov. Umahi had appropriated all the revenue points in the state to himself in such a way that the Local Government Councils are left as mere spectators. He coerced the LGs to cede all their revenue points to the state government with the state acting as their contractors. So, the state collects the revenues and remits meagre sums to the Councils.\n\nGov. Umahi had promised that the old Abakpa market would be converted to Fruits and Vegetable market. But now he has put up advertisements to sell the land in metres, for N6 million per parcels and the old Building Materials land for N12 million. Now, many people in the state are not comfortable with the arrangement. Their argument is that Umahi has impoverished Ebonyians so terribly, and nobody will have the money to participate in the land acquisition except the Governor, his family members and cronies. That is an indirect way of taking over the land.\n\nWhy is Umahi neglecting the Agricultural sector and the Mineral resources sector in the state? Money sent in by the Central Bank as loans for farmers in 2018/2019 never got to the real farmers in good numbers. He thinks that bringing in Chinese patners to mine some sites for him is all there is to developing the huge mineral deposits in the state. He has no serious template on what to do with the huge mineral deposits in the state. Once he and his family members are alright, then Ebonyians can go to hell\n\nAnd the ACECID report, in reference to Umahi family members, noted that \u201cit is incredible that one family would insist on absolute dependence on the resources of the government of the state to the point that they are not capable of doing anything at all for themselves without dependence on the state funds\u2019\u2019. This is so because Umahi who preaches private sector to Ebonyi people recalled his blood brothers living in other parts of Nigeria to come back to Abakaliki in 2015 when he was elected Governor to come and chop. Gov. Umahi\u2019s neglect of the Education Sector has affected the youths of Ebonyi state.\n\nRight now, large numbers of Ebonyi youths have gone back to street trading. Several of them live in abject poverty in Asaba, Delta state, Benin in Edo state, Ilaje Costain area of Olodi, Apapa, Ejigbo, Moroko, Iyana Ipaja and other super slums in Lagos state, where more than 15 persons sleep in one room. Information from neighbouring West African countries like Togo and Benin Republic indicate that Ebonyi youths are the main street traders in those places, no thanks to Umahi\u2019s draconian policies which drove them out of schools.\n\nI am personally ashamed of Gov.Umahi\u2019s backward performance in office, as someone from the same Senatorial district with him. He has really let us down and depicted us as backward people, if the comments by Ebonyians from other parts of the state are anything to go by. The most annoying are his childish tantrums, references to Koboko horse-whips, his constant assault on the basic rights of citizens, which portrays him as a Zebrudaya politician.\n\nThe economy of Ebonyi state has been stifled by Umahi\u2019s individualism and personal aggrandizement. There is tremendous capital flight in the sate because Umahi buys all his building/construction materials(cement, rods etc) directly from the manufacturers in Lagos(Dangote etc) and yet imposes punitive/authoritarian levies and taxies on Abakaliki local traders whom he hardly patronizes. The Governor is the sole contractor of all government jobs, except he decides to sublet some to a few of his cronies. Most of the jobs are executed through direct labour, arranged by him or by companies owned and registered by his brothers at the CAC. Now, he has engaged his sycophants, charlatans and barbarians(who are mostly uneducated) to swoop on anybody who criticizes his evil policies. The Facebook has become their latest platform after the use of Traditional Rulers to ostracize his critics from their communities suffered a woeful failure. The man is certainly the enemy of the people.\n\n4. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Superiority Complex: A Study in Empty Arrogance.\n\nGov.Umahi should be advised to stop his unnecessary grandstanding. His childish culture of kneeling down on, and measuring roads or pointing at different sections of a project is a complete misunderstanding of what governance is all about. He is not a genius in anything. There are better and younger Engineers in the Ministry of Works to perform those duties. He was elected to govern and governance in the state is actually suffering while he keeps running from pillar to post. Afterall, nobody knew him in Nigeria as a wonderful road builder.\n\nIt was Dr. Sam Egwu who gave him the first set of roads he did in 2006/2007 and up till today, Umahi is yet to construct any smooth road in his career as a Civil Engineer. All the roads he builds are always rough and a threat to the tyre\u2019s lifespan. A typical example is the Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway, running from the PDP Secretariate to Onuebonyi River which was awarded to his Construction company, Brass when he was PDP State Chairman under Elechi. The cement roads he introduced will soon become death traps as the edges are yet to be dressed.\n\nWhen Gov. Elechi made Umahi the State Chairman of PDP, he gave him the freehand and latitude to run the party. True to type Umahi began to abuse the powers of that office. He became impudent, arrogant and uncontrollable. While building the state party secretariat, he simultaneously started building his Osborne La Palm Hotel in Abakaliki. Check the building materials used in the two places and observe the similarities and then use your tongue to count your teeth.\n\nToday, the people of Amike Aba axis who live along the Nodo-Ogbaga Road are living in terrible distress. They are the people who sold their lands to Umahi to build his hotel, but they are being punished because of Umahi\u2019s Marchiavellian antics. The Ogbaga road which they use for their transportation and economic activities has been abandoned by Umahi.\n\nUmahi\u2019s claims to being a superior human being played out when he was the State PDP Chair(2007-2011). Umahi querried the then Deputy Governor, Prof. Chigozie Ogbu, accusing him of hosting a meeting of political office holders from Ebonyi South Zone. The man who signed the querry for Umahi at the time was Prince Ugorji Ama Oti, who was the Ebonyi South PDP Vice Chairman. Even though Ogbu did not answer the querry because of Elechi\u2019s intervention, Umahi showed himself very early to be a desperate political gold-digger and one always willing to bite the fingers which fed him. Recall that Ogbu brought Umahi to Abakaliki to execute a contract during the second term of Sam Egwu when Ogbu was Deputy.\n\nBut when he(Umahi) became the Deputy Governor to Elechi in 2011, and handed over the party Chairmanship to Ama-Oti, he started lording it over the Prince and was dictating to him and could never have tolerated being queried by him. So you can see that Umahi lacks any iota of principle in everything he does. When he eventually emerged as Governor in 2015, and Barr. Onyekachi Nwebonyi became the Chairman of the party, Umahi went ahead to surround him with his blood rleations. Austin Umahi was super-imposed as the National Vice Chairman of PDP and Maxwell Umahi as the State Deputy Chairman of the party. The result was that tha party executive was pocketed by the Umahi family, which was the preparatory ground for the excessive monetisation of party primaries in 2014. The PDP in Ebonyi was a dead organization before Umahi defected to APC in November, 2020. Many PDP faithfuls heaved a sigh of relief and it was seen as good riddance to bad rubbish.\n\nIt is equally on record that Umahi as PDP State Chair, querried the former Secretary to the State Government(SSG), Chief F.O.U.Mbam,mni, for allegedly printing a sub-standard invitation card for the 2008 Children\u2019s Day Celebration for the office of the then First Lady, Mrs. Josephine Elechi. Umahi compelled Anaegbu Echara to appear before the State Working Committee(SWC) of the party, where he was drilled, harassed, intimidated and subjected to dehumanizing questioning. Umahi was inspired by his spirit of sycophancy, so as to be in the good books of the first family.\n\nAs the state party Chair, Umahi operated simultaneously as a contractor-businessman, which he still does today even as a sitting Governor. While dualizing the Spearer-in-Deo- Onuebonyi section of the Enugu-Abakaliki Expressway, he saw a car parked in the line of his work. Umahi ordered his workers to bury the vehicle. It has been stated by several Ebonyians who know the Umahis that Gov. Umahi is wicked but the most wicked amongst them is Austin Umahi.\n\n5. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Assault on the Education Sector.\n\nBefore Gov. Umahi came into office in 2015, Ebonyi state University was rated as one the best state universities in Nigeria. But immediately Gov.Umahi took over as Governor, he became restless and started disturbing the peace of the university. He even went to the extent of addressing the University academic staff, a practice that is unheard of in the university system. He reduced the monthly subvention of the university from #350m to N117m.\n\nAn insider in the university who wrote under the pen-name, Mazi Eziokwu bu Ndu on 24th October, 2020 commented that: \u201cthe relationship between Gov.Umahi and EBSU has been unholy and un-Godly, filled with nightmares and regrets. Gov. Umahi reduced Professors to TAs and STAs and changed them from university professors to \u201cDivine Mandate\u2019\u2019 pastors. The ranking of the university nose-dived terribly and the dreams of Sen. Sam Egwu and other patriotic Ebonyi leaders had been shattered by a shylock leader.\u201d\n\nOther atrocities committed by Umahi\u2019s government in EBSU include the demotion and suspension of lecturers for unjustifiable reasons and the reduction of their salaries by 50%. Then the #3billion TETFUND sent to the university for staff training and provision of infrastructure in the university was diverted to commence the building of the College of Medicine in Uburu. EBSU is still suffering from denial of staff promotions; refusal to increase academic staff capacity despite losses of several academic staff to federal universities and refusal to improve the university infrastructure despite increases in tuition fees by 100%. Meanwhile, the university is owing the university staff up to four months arrears of salaries. Then the Governor was said to have demanded that the academic staff of the university should forfeit 20% of their salaries or lose their salaries for the remaining period of this administration. Hiding under the subterfuge of a verification exercise, Umahi is now owing secondary school teachers about three months of salaries, thereby contributing to the poverty of the teachers, as their motivation to teach is drastically affected.\n\nUmahi\u2019s attack against the intelligentsia and the educational system is calculated to suit his parochial weltanschaung. Umahi has a very narrow window through which he views the world. His world outlook is phobic and he has phobia for investment in education and human resources. So, because of his fear of the intelligentsia, he thinks that the best thing to always do is to extinguish them.\n\nWhen the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU ) gave indication of a strike action to press home its demands for improved working condition of its members, Gov.Umahi issued a statement proscribing ASUU, NASU and other unions in EBSU on 22nd October, 2020. He explained that \u201cthe decision was taken in order to ensure that academic and non-academic union activities do not negatively affect the resumption of EBSU and the commencement of academic and non-academic activities in the state-owned university.\u201d\n\nOn 25th October, 2020, ASUU National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi described the proscription of ASUU by Umahi as an aberration, meaning that Umahi\u2019s action was eccentric, unusual and queer. He stated that it was \u201ca confirmation that some politicians have not outgrown the military hangover more than 20 years into civil governance\u2019\u2019. Then he concluded by saying that \u201cthe tragedy of our democracy is that most of those occupying elective positions today have doubtful democratic credentials. These members of the ruling class see the rest of us their subjects instead of free citizens and their principals. Nigeria\u2019s democracy will not take roots until we all rise to challenge this undemocratic disposition\u2019\u2019.\n\nThen on 5th April, 2021, Gov. Umahi announced that he was going to build three new state universities. First of all, he explained that the College of Medicine in Uburu would be converted to King David Umahi University of Medical Sciences, with a view to ending medical tourism in Nigeria. However, the claim about ending medical tourism in Nigeria is an empty claim. Umahi can only build but can never run any place. For instance, he can never pay the Doctors, Nurses and other Health professionals their jumbo salaries. He will become envious of the fat salaries and start talking of salary reduction and that will be the end of the story. And that is why after six years in office he cannot operationalize the General hospitals he renovated in the 13 LGAs in the state.\n\nBut tongues are wagging already that Gov. Umahi may have concluded plans to kake over the university as his personal asset. One may not be surprised if he went in that direction, otherwise why name the university after himself. And we hear he is making frantic efforts to let the institution commence classes in October, this year.\n\nThe other two universities he is planning to build are the University of Technology in Izzi and the Aeroneutical University, to be located at the International Cargo Airport under construction, in Ezzaland. Umahi is making a mockery of himself and can go ahead and build anything his imagination opens up to him. He is looking for a flimsy excuse to continue his cement construction, but never to use the constructed projects to help humanity. He constructs and collects his money, full stop.\n\nHow many state universities do they have in some of the more serious states in Nigeria, namely Lagos, Rivers, Kano, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra etc? They have only one state university each. Then one of the poorest states in Nigeria wants to have four state universities even when it cannot pay salaries to lecturers in the existing one at hand now. We hope Umahi is not getting mental. He should be examined thoroughly. He is no longer making sense in his actions and conversations.\n\n6. Gov. Umahi\u2019s Omnibus Exco and the payment of Severance Allowance.\n\nI was already concluding this piece when a report came in that Emperor Umahi had dissolved his cabinet. Though I didn\u2019t see it as a serious and significant event, I paused to take a critical look at the Governor\u2019s over-bloated Executive Council, which I consider as one of the main features of his highly incompetent and corrupt government. Umahi\u2019s Executive Council is an assemblage of all kinds of people: Commissioners, Senior Special Assistants(SSAs) and Special Advisers(SAs). He himself put the total number of the membership at 106.\n\nHe claimed to have dissolved 83 while 23 others were not affected. Umahi has about 27 Commissioners. He likes to celebrate mediocrity and his appointments into the council dramatizes such tendency. I believe that he created the omnibus council in order to undermine the strength and capacity of the statutory members of the council, namely the Commissioners. These are the ones manning the statutory ministries and not the concucted/mushroom ministries created by Umahi to suit his manipulations.\n\nHe brings in the mediocre elements into his oversized Council to make the meetings unnecessarily rowdy and noisy, thereby not creating room for rigorous debates and proper voting as is required when consensus is not arrived at. He prefers to populate the council;l with his chorus singers and most times decisions are imposed on the council using such slogans as: No be so, Na so. Umahi\u2019s council dissolution is a non-issue. He may call on them to reapply the way he did before. He would subject them to all kinds of humiliating drills, so that by the time he recalls them they would have been sychologically down-sized. He lacks the strength of character to carry out a far-reaching overhall of the cabinet. Afterall, most of those he appointed in 2015 are still in his government.\n\nHe likes to work with people with internal problems who would not look him in the face and tell him the blunt truth. Umahi tends to empower mediocres so as to get unalloyed loyalty from them. He is always fearful of intellectuals quite unlike former Governors Egwu and Elechi. Those Exco members who argued and disagreed with them openly based on policy principles were highly respected and admired by them. Egwu had only 13 Commissioners of Cabinet rank and one Commissioner without Portfolio(ie. a non-Ministerial Commissioner in the Governors office in-charge of Special Duties), bringing his entire Exco to 19(including himself, his Deputy, SSG, HOS and Principal Secretary).\n\nElechi had about 26 Exco members, because he permitted his SAs to attend Exco meetings.\n\nNow, Gov.Umahi has generated a new controversy in the payment of severance to Executive Council members, especially those who served under former Governor, Chief Martin Elechi. True to his character as someone who can never be useful to anysbody in life, Umahi has come up with some unthinkable and impossible conditionalities. First and foremost, we learnt he started paying those who served under Elechi\u2019s second tenure. And he introduced a discriminatory dimension to it. Only those who served for the whole four years from 2011-2015 will be paid. All those who were in office for less than four years cannot qualify according to Umahi. So, many of those who served under Elechi\u2019s second term have been technically disqualified from getting their severance allowance. This Umahi style is a horrible invention and unknown to the rules and practice of the public service. Even the idea of segmenting it and procrastinating the payment of those who served in Elechi\u2019s first term administration is absurd and sad.\n\nThe payment of the Severance Allowance should not be on the basis of discrimination. All those who served in that government should be paid no matter the length of their services. Serving a government at that level is not an easy assignment. What matters is the scope and intensity of the engagements and the sacrifices made and not a question of the length of service.\n\nAfterall the same Umahi who is here talking about the length of service is still holding on to the gratuities of those civil servants who worked for 35 years and retired whereas he collected 400 million just after his first four years in service. So, why the rabble-rousing? Umahi\u2019s approach is childish and illogical. It is akin to a situation whereby a team goes for the world cup with 23 players and when it comes to payment of the bonus, the Coach insists that only the eleven players who played full time of ninety minutes would be entitled to the bonus. Umahi should change his ways and stop being a torn in the flesh of other human beings. His name currently evokes anger, sadness, resentment, hatred and ignominy. It is a shame.\n\nAbia Onyike,\n\nFormer Commissioner for Information, Ebonyi state.",

          "text": "*Military says retirement is voluntary\n\nAndrew Orolua, Abuja\n\nThe military high command has dispelled rumours about mass retirement of senior army officers with the appointment of a new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major-General Farouk Yahaya.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Irabor, on Thursday in Abuja during a media briefing on the operational efforts of the Armed Forces and other security agencies between May 20th and June 2nd, the Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko, recalled that rumours of mass retirement gained ground following Yahaya\u2019s appointment on May 27.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis has stirred up lot of rumours in the media about mass retirements in the military. I wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours.\n\n\u201cRetirement is only on voluntary basis for senior officers who desire to do so. At this point, no retirements has been authorized by the Military High Command.\u201d\n\nOn the military operations, he said that within the period in focus, troops intensified their efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, hoodlums and militancy as well as other criminalities across all the geo-political zones of the country.\n\nTroops conducted a series of clearance patrols, ambush, raid, picketing, cordon and search operations as well as artillery bombardments.\n\nAnti-piracy, anti-illegal oil bunkering, anti-crude oil theft, anti-pipeline vandalism and anti-smuggling operations were also conducted within the period.\n\nThe troops also carried out extensive air operations, which included aerial patrols, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions, offensive strikes, interdictions, search and rescue as well as close air support for ground troops, all of which yielded appreciable results.\n\nSpecifically, the troops of Operation HADIN KAI between 20 May and 2 June 2021 carried out a series of activities.\n\nThey rescued kidnapped victims, neutralized scores of terrorists, destroyed terrorists\u2019 enclaves, arrested terrorists and intercepted terrorists\u2019 logistics items including vehicles.\n\nOn 20 May 2021, troops had contact and engaged Boko Haram Terrorists (BHT) in Gwoza local government area of Borno State, swiftly responding to a distress call by farmers under attack by the criminals.\n\nTroops rescued the farmers, with several terrorists neutralized, while some others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.\n\nAlso on same day, troops while conducting clearance operations on BHT\u2019s hideouts at Ngaiwa, Tongunle, Washelle, Mo\u2019o, Mudollo, Mugdalla and Amtul villages, all in Dikwa LGA of Borno State, killed scores of the terrorists and recovered large caches of arms and ammunition.\n\nIn related developments, between 21 and 25 May, troops conducted cordon and search, raid operations and arrested BHT logistics suppliers at Ngamdu Town in Kaga LGA of Borno State, New Barracks Location along Damaturu \u2013 Potiskum road as well as Kukareta Town in Damaturu LGA of Yobe State.\n\nItems recovered during the operation included large numbers of jerry cans and drums of PMS, assorted arms and ammunition as well as other logistics items.\n\nThis has drastically dislocated the terrorists\u2019 logistics network in the region.\n\nMeanwhile on 23 May 2021, the Air Task Force of Operation HADIN KAI conducted an extensive interdiction missions near Gudumbali in Guzamal LGA and the Toumbuns of Lake Chad of Borno State.\n\nThe air interdiction missions executed with various NAF platforms resulted in the neutralization of scores of BHT criminal elements and destruction of their camps and logistics facilities.",

The government never declared the kidnappers to be a terrorist group,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe Bishop said this in his homily at the burial of late Rev Fr. Alphosus Yasshim Bello, at Our Lady of Apostle Catholic Church Independence Way, Kaduna State.\n\nRecall that Late Fr. Alphonsus Yashim Bello was kidnapped and murdered by bandits on 21st May, 2021 in Katsina State, while on secondment, after he was kidnapped alongside Rev Fr Joseph Keke.\n\nHe said the continued barbaric slaughter and murder of the people in their innocency suggests that a country\u2019s beautiful Presidential Villa, National Assembly, government houses are not evidence of civilization.\n\nHe said \u201cThose who govern us are allowing this killing of citizens in their innocency because they have no blood in their hearts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bishop Kukah, there is nowhere in the world where such barbaric act and killings of human lives has been manifested as it is in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cThere is no where citizens can be slaughtered in the whole world without the government showing empathy and concern.\n\nThe continuous barbaric slaughter and murder of our people in their innocency suggest that our beautiful Presidential Villa, National Assembly, government houses are not evidence of civilization.\n\n\u201cHow did Nigeria come to this tragic situation.\n\nWe know who they are, who they believe in and where their inspiration comes from. The government have never declared the kidnappers to be a terrorists group.\n\n\u201cThere is no ambiguity about those who are killing our people and why they are doing so and where their inspiration comes from.\n\nWe hear and live with stories of complicity at the highest level. We as Christians can only rely on the faithful word of God,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe also queried that, \u201cIs it possible that you have a country where people have sworn with Qur\u2019an and Bible to uphold the principle of governance, that they will do everything within their powers to protect and defend the integrity of Nigerians and suddenly we are where we are today.\n\n\u201cI think the President and Governors of Nigeria should address Nigerians and say, fellow Nigerians I have sworn that I will not protect you from foreign invaders, kidnappers and being killed.\u201cYou are on your own. Your security is in your own hands.\n\nKeeping you safe is not our immediate priority. Foreign bandits or anyone can come at will kill, loot, rape, kidnap and murder you.\n\nThey can wipe out your communities, destroy your homes, your farmlands, property.\n\n\u201cThey can kidnap or murder your children at will. They can rustle your cattle.\n\nIf they kidnap your children, wives or husbands, we will consider you criminals for negotiating for their release.\n\nWe are preparing a law that could see you go to jail for 15 years for this heinous crime against your fatherland,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe therefore urged Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayer, saying that God will lead them out of this tragic situation.",

          "text": "*His Royal Majesty, King Alfred Diete-Spiff, Amayanabo of Twon Brass, speaks\n\nBy Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nThe Amayanabo of Twon Brass in Bayelsa State, King Alfred Diete-Spiff, erstwhile Military Administrator of old Rivers State, during the regime of former Head of State General Yakubu Gowon, has cried out, saying \u201csome politicians alongside sub-contractors to the Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC)\u201d instigated thugs that attacked his palace and vandalized his properties for no justifiable reasons.\n\nKing Diete-Spiff told Palace Watch: \u201cSince this ugly incident, my phones have been rigging ceaselessly overflowing with calls from across the globe, especially from concerned relatives, friends, associates and some of my children, who are mostly based in the United States of America.\n\n\u201cHonestly as we speak, I\u2019m yet to make sense out of the reasons or rationale, why some politicians should make me their target, and deliberately tell lies and instigated thugs to do what they did to me as their king in a kingdom and state I have served with all my life. I have no hard feelings over this particular incident as I have decided to leave everything to God.\n\n\u201cContrary to all the reports that a military man shot and killed one of the protesters during the vandalization of my palace, those reports are not correct, they are not the true reflections of what happened on that day in that particular place. As far as I know, nobody was killed during the attack.\n\n\u201cThe Military personnel that were around the place during the incident exercised lot of professionalism and restraints, which must be commended.\n\nWhile the Nigerian Police watched helplessly while the vandalisation took place refusing to do anything.\n\n\u201cSince the unfortunate protest tagged \u2018#End SARS\u2019 which took place in Nigeria earlier in the year.\n\nSome of the Nigerian police personnel seem to have lost interest in the performance of their duties, and this has in no small measure cowed the Nigerian police personnel.\n\nSome of them unfortunately, no longer have the confidence to carry out their day to day assignments of protecting lives and properties.\u201d\n\nThe monarch stressed that if something urgent was not done to address this ugly development, things will seriously go wrong in Nigeria.\n\nAs a matter of urgency, the Nigerian Police high command must do something to engender confidence in its personnel, he stated, noting that if things remain the way they are now or allowed to degenerate further, the entire country and society will no longer be safe and protected.\n\nThe traditional ruler, however, expressed thanks to God Almighty for keeping him and some members of his family, who were around during the incident safe alongside his domestic and palace staff.\n\nKing Diete-Spiff took time to explain to Palace Watch what led to the ugly incident in Twon Brass on Sunday 16th up to Tuesday 18th of May, 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cdue to the general downturn in the nation\u2019s economy nay the world, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) could no longer meet up with some of its obligations to the communities in and around Twon Brass.\n\nIn the process, there were generally black-out or power outage in the whole areas. Most of the sub-contractors to Agip were not paid for the jobs done for some time, because Agip Oil Company was allegedly not paid its counterpart funding by the Nigerian government during the period in question.\n\nMost of the sub-contractors, who were supposed to show understanding during these very difficult period refused to see things with Agip Oil Company, in the process spreading false rumors and information. Meetings were held to douse the tension that was building up.\n\nSurprisingly, some politicians, who seem to be aggrieved for whatever reasons, which does not concern the palace, decided to capitalize on the situation and began to instigate the thugs and some employees of the sub-contractors who have not been paid for some months to take their aggression to the streets for no justifiable reasons in the process the palace was attacked and properties were destroyed.\n\nAll attempts to tell the protesters that there is very little or nothing the palace could do under that circumstances order than mediatory role that is ever ready to play, fell on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nThe Amayanabo further maintained that the power they hitherto complained about has since been restored in Twon Brass and environs, while several meetings are being held with all concerns, hence, the peace, that is gradually returning to the kingdom.\n\nHe said, as a traditional ruler, he has no option than to forgive all the people involved in the incident.\n\nHe added: \u201cin spite of this painful and ugly experience, I am more than ever before determined to forge a better bond with all members and sections of my kingdom.\n\nThis is the price traditional rulers have to pay as the most visible personalities in their various immediate communities.\n\n\u201cThe way and manner things are now in Nigeria, all efforts should be made to strengthen the third tier of government which is the local government councils across the country, for them to deliver services more effectively and efficiently.\n\nA situation where aggrieved or frustrated youths take their aggression to the traditional rulers of their communities, is dangerous and portends a lot of danger for the country as a whole.\n\nA lot more should be done as from now by the government at all levels to empower traditional rulers in particular, so that they will be in a position to intervene in some matters especially in situations like this.\n\nThe only way traditional rulers can play this role effectively, is for the traditional institutions to be empowered. The traditional rulers need a lot of money in the process.\u201d\n\nPalace Watch gathered that indigenes of the host community of Nigeria Agip Oil Company were protesting against what they called the protracted power outage in their communities, and the refusal to pay indigenous contractors for the job done for Agip and the failure of the company to meet its corporate social responsibility (CRS) to the people.\n\nThe Amayanabo said that he was, however consoled by the prompt condemnations of the incident by a cross section of Ijaw leaders and groups.\n\nFor example, the Twon Brass Chapter of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) condemned the attack saying it would not condone any disrespect to their monarch either from indigenes or foreigners.\n\nThe chairman of the group Mr. Hello Richard and other representatives of the Ijaw clan in a statement, said that their attention was drawn to the ugly incident, which was said to have been provoked by a military personnel, who allegedly shot a protester during what they tagged peaceful demonstrations by the people of Twon Brass Kingdom in Brass Local Government Area Council against Agip Oil Company.\n\nThey continued: \u201cFrom our findings, the protest, triggered into chaos after some persons hijacked it and started to foment trouble in the process, which eventually led to the attack on the Amayanabo\u2019s palace.\n\n\u201cWe further learnt that while trying to protect the monarch, a soldier allegedly shot one of the protesters in the leg and this particular incident, as to be expected, generated more tension in the community.\n\nThis shooting only took place when some persons hijacked the protest and destroyed part of the King\u2019s Palace.\u201d",

          "text": "Michael Adesina\n\nFemi Adesina has described President Muhammadu Buhari as a man of iron and steel who is ready to knock sense into stubborn heads and whip everyone into line.\n\nAdesina stated this in his weekly article (From The Inside) while reacting to President Buhari\u2019s warning to troublemakers in the country.\n\nIn the article titled \u2018I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PRESIDENT\u2019, Adesina also stated that Buhari can never be accused of genocide after Twitter deleted the president\u2019s tweet on 1967-70 Nigerian Civil War and his comment on treating \u201cthose misbehaving today\u201d in \u201cthe language they will understand\u201d.\n\nHe added that Nigeria now needs the combination of General Buhari and President Buhari.\n\nPlease read Femi Adesina\u2019s article below:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari spoke on Tuesday, warning troublemakers in the country that the picnic was over, and the next day, I saw this comment online from a Buharist, as lovers and admirers of the President are known:\n\n\u201cI just finished watching the President on TV reading the riot act to troublemakers, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the President. I suddenly remembered why I fell in love with the President.\u201d\n\nThat respondent sure spoke the minds of millions of Buharists in Nigeria and the Diaspora. The man we fell in love with is of iron and steel, one ready and willing to knock sense into contumacious heads, whipping everyone into line. And being kind to us in the process. A kind bully, if you like the oxymoron.\n\nHow did things unfold that Tuesday afternoon, that led President Buhari to make the speech that is perhaps the most epochal in recent times?\n\nChairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had led top guns of the electoral body into the meeting room with the President, shortly before the scheduled time of 3 pm.\n\nLike clockwork, President Buhari came in at the dot of the appointed time. He never misses it. And Prof Yakubu began his briefing. What were the main points?\n\n*The spate of attacks on INEC\u2019s offices and facilities nationwide has grave implications for elections and electoral activities in Nigeria.\n\n*So far, there have been 42 of such attacks across the country since the 2019 General Election. The incidents occurred in 14 states for a variety of reasons, including bandit attack, 1, Boko Haram, 1, EndSARS protest, 18, post-election violence, 4, thuggery during elections, 6, unknown gunmen and hoodlums, 12.\n\n*Thirty out of the 42 or 71% of the attacks happened in the last 7 months.\n\nThey appear to be targeted at future elections, with the intention to incapacitate INEC, undermine democracy, and precipitate a national crisis.\n\nThe INEC Chairman enumerated the immediate implications of the development, unfolded actions taken by the Commission, and asked for the intervention of Mr President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nConfronted by such graphic display of anarchy, what should a President do? Throw up his hands in surrender, acquiesce, and tell everyone to go home in defeat and capitulation?\n\nRemember how we started this piece. President Muhammadu Buhari (PMB) was once General Muhammadu Buhari (GMB), the army commander who gave Chadian forces who made incursion into Nigerian territory a bloody nose.\n\nHe dealt with Maitatsine religious fanatics. He gave a red card to hard drug traffickers, who were executed by firing squad.\n\nHe introduced War Against Indiscipline, and generally attempted to make us prim and proper. He was succeeding before hidden, hostile hands terminated the regime. Thirty years later, Nigerians yearned for that GMB, and massively voted him back to power.\n\nThe response of the President to INEC elicited different kinds of reactions from different people and groups. What did he say?\n\n*Those behind the attacks on national assets want the Administration to fail, and enough is enough. Soon, they will receive the shock of their lives.\n\n*Many of those misbehaving today were too young to know the destruction that attended our Civil War (1967-1970), but those of us that were in the fields, fighting to keep the country together, won\u2019t just fold our arms. We\u2019ll rather speak to them in a language they would understand.\n\n*I lead the country according to our Constitution, and anyone who wants to destroy the country would answer for it.\n\n*We are expending resources to build infrastructure, and we won\u2019t allow anyone destroy them. We will be harder on troublemakers.\n\n*We have changed the Service Chiefs and Inspector General of Police. We will give them all the resources they need, and then demand security from them.\n\n*We will give INEC all the resources required to conduct elections, so that no one would accuse us of not wanting to leave office, or that we want a 3rd term.\n\nIn reaction to what the President said, I also saw this comment online: \u201cHis followers are reinvigorated. They are buzzing.\u201d\n\nTrue. What our country needs at this time is iron and steel. An alchemy of GMB and PMB. We are in a democracy, yes, but democracy is no byword for lawlessness. If anybody misbehaves in any part, repeat, ANY PART, of the country, they need to be whipped into line.\n\nThe nation needs not go into a tailspin because some people bear giant-sized grudges in their hearts. By the way, is there any part of the country that does not have one grievance or the other? Is the next option then to capsize the boat of the country? Any leader that has sworn to uphold the Constitution would not open his eyes, and see it happen.\n\nLeaders must do whatever they should do to maintain peace and tranquility in their countries. Their intentions will always be misinterpreted and misrepresented. No matter.\n\nThe good of the larger majority must be considered at all times. North, South, East, West, anarchy should never be condoned, no matter what some people may say.\n\nI like how Moyosore Oyetunji, a passionate Buharist on Facebook summarized the latest developments: \u201cWhen he pleaded with you to eschew violence, you accused him of becoming a motivational speaker, instead of the General that he is. Now he has decided to be it, you are crying. Please, what exactly do you want from him?\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari is not genocidal, and can\u2019t ever be accused of such intentions. But a leader worth his salt cannot look on, and watch law and order break down irretrievably. It is not about a people, or region. It is about the country he took an oath to keep together.\n\nEvery region has one grouse or the other against the state of our union. But murder and mayhem should never be an option in resolving matters. That is the message of President Buhari, and it should be the message of every good Nigerian.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

We are damned if we do, and damned if we do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cHOPE AND COURAGE\u201d\n\nA series of comments by IOC officials have sparked outrage in Japan, including one by IOC Vice President John Coates that the Olympics would be held even under a state of emergency such as is currently in place in Tokyo and other regions.\n\nJapan\u2019s government also says the Games can go ahead safely despite a slow vaccine rollout and rising numbers of severe coronavirus cases straining the medical system. The country has recorded nearly 750,000 cases and more than 13,000 deaths.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga faces a general election and a ruling party leadership race this year, and pulling off the Games, with an estimated budget of $15.4 billion, is seen as critical to keeping his job.\n\nMedical adviser Omi this week issued his strongest warning yet over what he characterised as a lack of discussion within the government and organising committee over how to control the movement of people if the Games go ahead.",

Nobody knew the total number of unregistered sims.\n\n\u201cWithin less than 15 days in the office, we have engaged the NCC as a regulator. We have directed them to carry audit exercise to enable them come up with unregistered and partial registered sims. They came with around 9.4 million which is enough to populate another country. It was the first time we didn\u2019t know the total of unregistered sims in the country.\n\n\u201cAnd we went further to direct NCC, to ensure that by 25th September 2019, that is only one month few days in office, I spent there to ensure that by end of September 2021, no sim that is not registered will be on our network. NCC as a regulator implemented that effectively.\n\n\u201cFrom end of September 2019, to 2020, you will discover that even kidnapping and banditry reduced to the barest minimum. It was a time that hardly can you spend one month or more without hearing about kidnapping.\n\n\u201cThe more you come up with policies to make the system effective the more criminals will come up with another strategy to compromise the policies.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that before the introduction of the policy, some unscrupulous Nigerians working in cahoots with a handful of agents of telecommunication officials engaged in illegally preregistering sim cards which were sold to criminal gangs to perpetrate crime.\n\nAlso speaking during the occasion, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communication Commission, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said just as the Commission and the Federal Government were working out policies to thwart plans by criminals, criminals were also evolving.\n\nHe noted that it was now sad that kidnappers now use the telephones of their victims to demand and receive ransom.

Others are declaration of winners, voter registration, voter authentication, balloting, vote collation and vote transmission.\u201d\n\nOn the voter registration towards 2023 election, he said voter enrolment software would be introduced to recapture as much fingerprints as possible, using better fingerprint capturing software and hardware.\n\nThis, he said, would conform in totality with the NIMC requirements for citizens\u2019 registration;\n\n\u201cWith the plans to commence the use of electronic voting machine (EVM), it is important to update the register of voters to include additional biometric features like facials, as this will strengthen the integrity of the register,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe also underscored \u201cthe need to have additional fields captured \u2013 like email addresses, disability status \u2013 for those who are living with disabilities,\u201d stressing that all these necessitated the need for a new voter enrolment software.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This has stirred up a lot of rumours in the media about mass retirements in the military,\u201d he told reporters at the briefing.\n\nHe added, \u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only on a voluntary basis for senior officers who desire to do so. At this point, no retirement has been authorised by the Military High Command.\u201d\n\nThe military spokesman also highlighted some of the feats recorded by troops in the course of various operations in parts of the country.\n\nAccording to him, there is no gainsaying that the military and the security agencies are committed to ensuring peace returns to the country.\n\nOnyeuko also assured Nigerians that the military remained resolute to take decisive and adequate actions to abate the activities of terrorists and bandits, as well as other vices in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Military High Command will not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate our proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe Military High Command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the Armed Forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe successes recorded by troops are highlighted below:\n\nGentlemen of the Press, it is my honour and privilege to once again update you on the operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies conducting operations to tackle insecurity in our dear Country.

He died on April 9, aged 99.\n\nIn a statement of condolence then, the Bidens paid tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh. \u201cHis legacy will live on not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavours he shaped,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe meeting with the president and first lady will come the day after the Queen\u2019s official birthday, and will follow the three-day summit of Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall, southwest England.\n\nThe G7 gathering starts Biden\u2019s first foreign tour since he took office in January.

          "title": "Nigeria Says $1.5m for Clinical Trial Delaying First Local Covid Vaccine",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government Thursday explained that the production of the first local vaccine for Covid-19 is threatened by its inability to raise the $1.5 million cost of the clinical trial.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said at the ministerial press briefing organised by the Presidential Communication Team in Abuja that a Nigerian researcher had developed a COVID-19 vaccine with a high probability to succeed but no fund yet for the clinical trial.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government may look for sponsors who would recoup their investment when the vaccine is successful so that all the stages of the trial can be fulfilled.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no personal interest in this. There are at least two, perhaps even three, Nigerian laboratories that have developed what you call vaccine candidates.\n\n\u201cIn fact, yesterday, we also talked to a fourth Nigerian laboratory, based in Maryland, USA. He has also produced his own vaccine candidate. A vaccine candidate means that you have already been able to get the antigen, you have produced something that will work.\n\n\u201cNow, you have to do what is called the clinical trials; clinical trial means you go through testing it that it\u2019s safe. First of all, if it\u2019s safe, it doesn\u2019t cause a problem. \u201cSecondly, that it does what it promises to do; generate antibodies in your system. Okay. So, you go through those clinical trials, which are very detailed and they are expensive.\n\n\u201cOne of our researchers here, who has produced such a candidate, I asked him, how much do you think you\u2019ll need to go through these clinical trials; phase one, phase two, phase three? At least $1.5 million. That\u2019s a lot. Do we have that now to test a vaccine?\n\n\u201cWell, we say we look for sources where we can get the sponsors because the sponsorship is what you need. What some people do is that they invest in it and then once you produce the vaccine, it\u2019s successful, they buy it and that means you are done. But if it turns out not to have worked, your money is gone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a way to sponsor these clinical trials because they are expensive and they have a very good chance of being successful. But some of them also have a good chance of not being able to see strong enough you know, the trick of efficacy. The efficacy means how well it works.\n\n\u201cSo, we want to support our own vaccine and do the necessary to make sure they come out. But we are looking for the funds to support and also the necessary technical and whatever other backings that are required to get them to a level where they can\u2026 not only shall we be proud, it will be cheaper for us, we can be able to export also.\n\n\u201cSo, we are looking at that, we\u2019re looking for it and that\u2019s in fact our preference. We know that those who are producing a vaccine now, we are at their mercy and I\u2019ve said before that even if you have money now, you may not even get your vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe minister also explained the delay in getting the supplementary budget ready for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, saying the government wanted to get a clearer picture of the different prices of the available vaccines, before submitting a budget.\n\nEhanire said the budget figures were still in rough stages and would soon be done tuned.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are different prices of the vaccines and we don\u2019t really know exactly the one we\u2019re getting. And we also know that the ones we\u2019re getting from COVAX are at no cost to us. So what we\u2019re doing is that the additional ones that we\u2019re going to get will take care of 50 million Nigerians. COVAX will take care of 20 million, they are even offering to take care of more than that, maybe up to 30 million.\n\n\u201cThe prices vary, some vaccines are in the neighbourhood of $20 or $30, others are $5 or $6. So to really make a budget, we are working on a rough sketch, some money have been earmarked. But Mr. President has also announced that there will be a supplementary budget. But we want to get a clearer picture first, before you actually submit a budget.\n\n\u201cSo, we only have rough figures and as soon as those figures are there we can continue. We are also looking for perhaps, as I said, if we have to make the payments, we can find some money to do that. But when that budget time comes, we need some precise information.\u201d\n\nAsked for a particular figure for the vaccine budget, Ehanire said: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t disclose any figure to you now because is not something we can immediately put out because as I said before, the prices are different.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at Johnson and Johnson now, but if for example, we are to get more AstraZeneca vaccine, there is a steep difference between the two. And then again, if they are going to give you the Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer was on the original list of COVAX and that is different. So we\u2019re not really going to go public but very soon we will once we have all the figures.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Thursday allayed concerns about possible mass retirement of top military officers superior to the Chief of Army, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya.\n\nIt said contrary to reports of an impending exodus of about 30 Generals in the military following the appointment of Yahaya, a member of the 37 Regular Course of Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), other major generals and equivalent ranks in the military senior to him would be redeployed to the Defence Headquarters.\n\nIn line with military tradition that forbids seniors saluting juniors, members of Course 35, 36 and 37 were expected to leave the service following Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that members of Course 35, notably the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP), Maj. Gen. Benjamin Ahanotu, and Commander, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Maj. Gen. Abubakar Maikobi, have not been seen at official functions since Yahaya assumed duties.\n\nAhanotu\u2019s deputy has been standing in for him at official functions.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that most Course 36 officers were redeployed to Defence Headquarters and tri-service institutions, notably Armed Forces Resettlement Centre, Command and Staff College, Jaji and TRADOC and have since assumed duties.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, is of Course 34, whom by his seniority could accommodate officers of Courses 35 and 36 cadres in tri-service institutions under the DHQ.\n\nThe new army chief is believed to have accepted to work with his coursemates (Course 37).\n\nBriefing the media in Abuja yesterday, Acting Director of the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Bri. Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, said the military was not contemplating any retirement and had, in fact, not retired any general.\n\n\u201cI wish to use this medium to dispel such unfounded rumours. Retirement is only voluntarily for senior officers who desire to do so,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAt this point, no retirement has been authorised by the military high command.\u201d\n\nHe said the military high command would not be weary of appreciating the general public for their support and continue to encourage them to provide credible and timely information that will facilitate their proactive engagements in the theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cThe military high command also lauds all efforts of the gallant troops of the armed forces and personnel of other security agencies involved in various operations across the country for their resilience and indefatigable commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko also reviewed DDMO\u2019s operational activities nationwide between May 20 and June 2.\n\nHe said the operations were the combined efforts of the military and other security agencies involving land, maritime and air operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is worthy of note that these operations are conducted simultaneously in the various theatres of operation on daily basis across the country. The unrelenting and committed efforts of the gallant troops as well as the cumulative results of our operational activities in the various operations and specific events will be highlighted under the different operations.\n\n\u201cWithin the period in focus, troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria intensified their operational efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, hoodlums and militancy as well as other criminalities across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d According to him, the troops conducted series of clearance patrols, ambush, raid, picketing, cordon and search operations as well as artillery bombardments.\n\nOthers are anti-piracy, anti-illegal oil bunkering, anti-crude oil theft, anti-pipeline vandalism and anti-smuggling operations. He said there were also extensive air operations, which included air patrols, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions, offensive air strikes, air interdictions, search and rescue operations, and close air support for ground troops.\n\nHe said troops of Operation Hadin Kai carried out series of operational activities.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey rescued kidnapped victims, neutralised scores of terrorists, destroyed terrorists\u2019 enclaves, arrested terrorists and intercepted terrorists\u2019 logistics items, including vehicles.\n\n\u201cOn 20 May 2021, troops had contact and engaged BHT criminal elements in Gwoza LGA of Borno State. This occurred as troops swiftly responded to a distress call by farmers on an attack on their location. Troops gallantly rescued the farmers. During the encounter, several terrorists were neutralised, while some others escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this Thursday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency on Thursday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nAlso on Thursday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nKayode Fasua in Abeokuta",
