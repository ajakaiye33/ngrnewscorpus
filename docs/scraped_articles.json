          "title": "When Nigeria\u2019s best solution hides in plain sight",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Michael Achimugu\n\nI REMEMBER the massive uproar and pessimism that greeted the idea of Islamic banking proposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria under the leadership of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi.\n\n\u201cThey want to Islamise Nigeria.\u201d \u201cWe will not take it!\u201d I was also sceptical myself. Who wouldn\u2019t? The lines holding together the fabric of this potentially great country have always been blurred and, with each successive government, almost disappearing into oblivion. But Islamic banking came and has put paid to the \u201cIslamisation agenda\u201d narrative. Everyone is benefitting from Jaiz, Taj, and all the other banks operating on the same principles.\n\nBeneficiaries cut across every ethnicity, including Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa. My good friend from the South-East, Chief Ndubueze, was able to fund his rice processing business. The bank did not care for his tribe or religion before they helped him to secure equipment to take his business to the next level. What many people did not know was that the man who facilitated the establishment of Islamic banks was a certain professor from the South-East: Kingsley Moghalu, a lawyer, author, politician and astute technocrat who had worked at the United Nations for 17 years.\n\nIn that time the young, amiable and \u2013 now former Deputy-Governor of CBN proved his mettle in a field that consisted mostly of former presidents of foreign nations, ministers, and some of the most inventive men and women in the world.\n\nThat inventiveness was even more apparent when the young scholar facilitated, yet again, the rollout of payment systems reforms, including the development and introduction of the unique identifier Bank Verification Number, BVN. President Goodluck Jonathan had promised to use the BVN to tackle insecurity- a task that would have been achieved had Moghalu been retained in the system to teach the APC government how to use technology, rather than media circuses, to fight terrorism. Just like \u2018The Prof\u2019 in the viral Spanish series, Money Heist, Prof. Kingsley Moghalu understands that strategy- not brawn \u2013 wins wars. Imagine what would have been having he won the general elections in 2019. Thankfully, it\u2019s not too late to fix this.\n\nDespite being the youngest member of various committees tasked by the UN Secretary-General, Prof. Moghalu always delivered and continued to be relevant as a solutions provider, so much that he has become one of the most highly-sought consultants in the world. In 2006, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed him a member of the UN General Assembly-mandated Redesign Panel on the United Nations Internal Justice System. He was the youngest member and the only one who was not either a former president or minister.\n\nA son of Nigeria was \u2018killing it on the global stage but, back home, this country wallowed in fearsome darkness, under the control of incompetent, unfeeling leaders. Looking back, it was strange that the country had a globally certified citizen who was willing to serve, in plain sight, but chose to go to the polls and abdicate their electoral power to the excuse of: \u201cHe does not belong in a big party\u201d.\n\nIf big parties were the solution would there be much gnashing of teeth today? Would it not seem strange that anyone can see where their problems lie but choose to exist and complain in shackles rather than use their powers to break free from slavery even though the solution was right before them, in plain sight? It would be an indictment on Nigerians of 2022 to be afraid of taking charge of their destinies a whole 219 years after the great Igbo Landing at Dunbar Creek. Now, I am not saying that anyone should commit suicide. Far from it. Those brave Igbo folk died so that we could live free. Now we must preserve that freedom for our children by resisting the reinforcement of failure (apologies to President Obasanjo).\n\nInsecurity: My heart broke to see Prof. Moghalu\u2019s wife cry in a recent interview about the fatal shootings of innocent, young Nigerians in what is now known as the \u2018Abuja-Kaduna Train Massacre\u2019. It gave me the same vibes as watching Patience Jonathan weep on national TV.\n\nIt was as easy for short-sighted people to mock the former First Lady then as it is to ignore Mrs Moghalu\u2019s tears today, but we seem to be a people who only learn by bitter experiences. Talking about the subject, it occurred to me that Kingsley Moghalu had always been given assignments that centred on bringing peace to war-ravaged countries. And he delivered. From Yugoslavia to Croatia and Rwanda to Tanzania, Moghalu went, saw, and made Nigeria proud.\n\nFrom a young age, he was involved in human rights and credible election duties at the international level (UN Human Rights and Elections Officer, 1992). Such invaluable experience is one that Nigeria must leverage for sustainable growth.\n\nThe time for regrets is gone and whatever little time lies ahead of us, we can only try to fix yesterday, today. It is the only way tomorrow will be better. Writing about Moghalu\u2019s competencies is not praise-singing; he truly does know the job! The freshness he brings is a new lease of life, a viable option for Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nYouth: \u201cThe good thing about my presidency is that power will be handed downwards to younger people only. Whoever comes after me cannot be older,\u201d says the professor. But, for me, age is not even the point here. Professor Moghalu knows more mobile apps than I do! And I am younger. It speaks to the global and modern outlook of the man with three Masters\u2019 Degrees that he is never caught napping when it comes to youthful innovations.\n\nWe need a President who tweets by himself. It would mean that he is not selfishly insulated from the opinions of citizens. He can interact and read the room rather than abdicate his sense of empathy to aides. PKM, as he is fondly called, understands tech. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s biggest potential in that sector and a president like Kingsley Moghalu will create the best possible environment for young tech founders to thrive.\n\nThere\u2019s no reminding anyone of the difference between the CBN of SLS/Moghalu and what obtains now. The robust, business-friendly policies that promoted small and medium scale businesses in Moghalu\u2019s progressive era central bank have virtually been stifled by draconian laws and attacks on fledgling business models that could have put us at par with tech-driven economies around the world.\n\nWhile other aspirants, especially in the two major political parties, have insulted the sensibilities of Nigerians with insensitive ego-boosting and dishonest campaign ads, PKM has recently launched an issues-based Moghalu gives you more and streets-based #ProfMoMyGuy campaign videos. While the former speaks to the very salient issues bedevilling Nigeria, the latter connects with ordinary Nigerians.\n\nThe professor has also set a new benchmark by sparing no expense in delivering quality visuals to Nigerians while collaborating with- again \u2013 young people in the entertainment industry. Yoms, the lead character in the Moghalu gives you more video, is an award-winning spoken word artist whose exponential growth has inspired many. The fact that PKM is able to discover and partner effectively with upcoming names and faces is a testimony of his ability to make new ideas work. In Prof. Kingsley, Moghalu Nigeria\u2019s entertainment industry has found its most genuine partner. Ask the likes of Banky W.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This shows that the pardon of the former Governors is indeed the wishes of the people .\n\n\u201cWe express our gratitude to the President for heeding the calls by many including Senator Jonah David Jang who in 2021 made a passionate appeal to Mr. President for the pardon and release of Senator Dariye and former Governor Jolly Nyame to enable them contribute their quota to the development of the nation.\n\nWe welcome our leaders home and wish them success especially as we look forward to having them return to a turf they are familiar with, politicking and providing leadership for our people.

          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Government, in collaboration with Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC, has suspended resumption date of toll collection at the Ikoyi Link Bridge Toll Plaza indefinitely.\n\nToll collection was earlier scheduled to begin on April 16, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, after several engagements with critical stakeholders, LCC decided to shift the resumption date of toll collection at the Ikoyi Link Bridge Toll Plaza, till further notice.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by the Managing Director of LCC, Yomi Omomuwasan and made available to newsmen on Friday, the company decided to delay the resumption of toll collection for further consultations with key stakeholders in the Eti-Osa, Lekki area, in a bid to address their concerns and arrive at a mutually favourable resolution of all issues.\n\nBesides, the shift became necessary to give customers more time to register for the electronic devices.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cAs a responsible organization, we must take full cognizance of everyone within the axis.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we want to continue with the ongoing engagements with our stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory operations to resume tolling on the Bridge have been smooth so far, and we are grateful to all the key stakeholders for their cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe planned commencement of toll collection has now been postponed, allowing more of our customers to register for the electronic toll devices to enable seamless passages at the toll plaza.\u201d\n\nThis development is coming after series of meetings in the last week between the management of LCC and key stakeholders, including residents\u2019 associations.\n\n\u201cTalks with key stakeholders will continue, while a new date for toll collection will be announced soon,\u201d Mr. Omomuwasan said.\n\nRecall that Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had conceded to make some concessions over the planned resumption of tolling to the Ikoyi Link Bridge, and Lekki-Epe Expressway areas of the state.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nSanwo-Olu, while agreeing on the concessions, however, sought for cooperation and understanding from residents and stakeholders in the meantime.\n\nThe governor spoke at a meeting with the stakeholders on the resumption of tolling at Lekki-Ikoyi Bridge and Lekki-Epe Expressway at Lagos House, Marina.\n\nPersonalities at the meeting, included: leaders of the Lekki Residents Association, LERA, Lekki Residents and Stakeholders Association,LERSA.\n\nWhile government representatives, besides Mr. Governor, were: Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Moyosore Onigbanjo SAN, Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, Lekki Concession Company, LCC Managing Director, Yomi Omomuwasan and LCC Board member Obafemi George.\n\nAlso at the meeting were: President of LERSA, Olorogun James Emadoye, Vice President of LERSA, Arc. O.P.A. Ladega, Financial Secretary, LERSA, Mr. Keji Olajide, Director of Stakeholders Engagements, LERSA, Mrs. Chika Allison-Idalah, Chairman of Infrastructure Committee, LERSA, Sulyman Bello, Chairman of Lekki Phase 1 Estate Residents Association, Mr. Yomi Idowu, Mr. Sony Irabor, Mr. Demola Folarin, Mr. Seni Adio,, Mrs. Eniola, and Mr. Paul Kogoro, all of LERA.\n\nDuring the session which lasted for several hours, the guests explained their position on the matter and demanded for some concessions.\n\nThe governor, having listened to each speaker, agreed to make some concessions after showing evidence of LCC\u2019s financial situation and why tolling should resume at the plaza.\n\nOmotoso, speaking on the development, added that the \u201cLCC management would soon be announcing details of the concessions, following Mr Governor\u2019s directive.\u201d\n\nThe tolling was suspended in the wake of #EndSARS protest when soldiers in an attempt to disperse protesters at the Lekki-Epe Toll Gate, on October 20, 2020, shot live bullets into the crowd of protesters in which unspecified number of persons were allegedly killed and several others sustained injuries.\n\nHowever, following months of engagement with key stakeholders within Eti-Osa /Lekki-Epe area, management of LCC had officially announced the formal return to tolling operations on Friday, April 1, 2022 at the Ikoyi Link Bridge Toll Plaza.\n\nHowever, LCC affirmed that toll payment will not commence until April 16, 2022.\n\nA statement by Omomuwasan, read in part: \u201cLCC has been a worthy part of the Eti-Osa/ Lekki-Epe ecosystem and has served the community relentlessly and to the best of its ability over the years.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the response and the cooperation received from the vast majority of residents and stakeholders who appreciate the value we bring to bear on their daily movement and continue to register for (or update ) their toll accounts in readiness for the commencement of cashless toll collection. All the points made at the engagements are well taken.\n\n\u201cWhilst LCC is aware of the concerns expressed by some stakeholders regarding the return to tolling, it is common knowledge that the government cannot, on its own, meet all the infrastructural needs of the ever-growing population.\n\n\u201cGiven that the funding for the project was secured by the initial private sector sponsors and contracts were signed with various local and international financial institutions, in the spirit of respecting the sanctity of contracts, the Lagos State Government continues to meet these obligations when it bought over the shares of LCC, thereby taking over both the assets and liabilities.\n\n\u201cTo ensure a smooth return, LCC has deployed new and more efficient technology at the Ikoyi Bridge Toll Plaza. Therefore, to test run the new system and ensure a seamless interface with road users, the first two weeks will be completely toll \u2013 free.\n\n\u201cLCC remains committed to providing a safer and better driving experience on the Ikoyi Link Bridge.\u201d\n\nAlso, Earlier, Lekki residents, under the aegis of Lekki Peninsula Phase 1 Residents Association, had written the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to suspend the planned resumption of toll at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge and the Lekki-Epe Expressway.\n\nIn an open letter to the governora signed by the Chairman of the association, Yomi Idowu, the residents raised socio-economic reasons and other critical issues that were yet to be addressed which made the decision to recommence tolling unjust, oppressive, and illegal.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cWe view with deep concern and trepidation the less than transparent attempt at recommencing tolling activities at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, even as matters relating to the #EndSARS protest, which led to the termination of tolling activities in the first place, remain largely unresolved. The issue is compounded by the myriad of issues bedeviling the rationale to toll at this location.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that the Lekki Phase 1 Residents Association (LERA) implores the Lagos State Government (LASG) to apply wisdom and shelve its plans to resume toll collection on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\u201d\n\nLERA further maintained that there were issues of pending court matter; ownership questions and lack of transparency; underdevelopment of the Lekki-Epe corridor; and justice for #ENDSARS victims, that were yet to be addressed by the government, making the recommencing of the toll illegal.\n\nOn the pending court matter, LERA argued that \u201cthe Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC and Lagos Goverment have continued to use the instrumentality of the law courts to foist hardship on our community.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cWe recall that the Federal High Court in Lagos had in the recent past effectively declared the tolling of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge as illegal and unconstitutional. Lagos State Government characteristically secured an order of stay of execution on the ground that it had appealed the court\u2019s decision but has so far failed to prosecute the subject appeal.\n\n\u201cWith this Sword of Damocles hanging over our community, one expected Lagos State Government to pursue the best interest of its citizenry rather than use the machinery of the state against law-abiding citizens.\n\n\u201cRather than work to seek peace, the State is actively working through LCC to inflict more suffering and hardship on its citizens. It is within this context that we understand that protests are being planned under the banner #NoJusticeNoToll. If the\n\nprotests happen, the residents and businesses in Lekki will be the most affected,\u201d LERA said.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we feel it is expedient to bring all the above to your attention and to particularly note that the general mood of the people suggests that LCC should refrain from collecting tolls at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge and the Lekki-Epe Expressway until these fundamental issues are addressed. To do otherwise will be to needlessly stoke the tension which pervades the nation.\n\n\u201cWe urge Your Excellency to act to exercise maximum restraints at this point and to immediately suspend this planned resumption of tolling at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in the overriding interest of peace and order in our community.\u201d",

          "text": "Chidi Ikediashi Foundation on Friday administered free healthcare services to indigenes of Obulu Okiti, a community in Aniocha South local government area of Delta state.\n\nThe foundation is sponsored by Comr Chidi Ikediashi, the supervising councilor for environment in the local government council who was on the ground at the Obulu Okiti primary healthcare centre where the free healthcare services were carried out said not less than 500 residents, including elderly men and women, youths and children received free testing, blood pressure checks, eye checks, blood sugar checks, and other services\n\nIn an interview at the treatment centre, Ikediashi said he picked an interest in the healthcare aspect of the sustainable development goals (SDG) to meet the health needs of his people.\n\n\u201cI started from Ubulu Okiti because charity begins at home. However, this foundation\u2019s service will cut across all the local government areas in Delta state. My aim is to meet certain health needs of our people and leave an impact in their lives.\u201d\n\nHe said the foundation employed the services of Anioma Medical Professionals which comprises doctors from Delta North to carry out the project. He said he thought it wise to affiliate with them because they are professionals and experienced doctors.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is good to know the right people and use them when the need like this arises.\u201d He said the turn out of the residents was encouraging.\n\nChairman of Aniocha South local government council, Jude Chukwuweike, commended Ikediashi for carrying out the laudable healthcare service to his people.\n\n\u201cOne must appreciate a young man like this for taking this venture. Ordinarily, politicians prefer giving out rice, salt, and other cooking ingredients, but Ikediashi is rather saving lives. He is doing it for the right people. People should have the passion to do something worthwhile for others.\n\n\u201cChidi is not the richest man in Ubulu Okiti but he is touching lives. I want to encourage his mates to take suit. This is a way of showing that youths can take over. With this, the other politicians will be convinced that if given the opportunity, he will do more. He is using his personal resources for this project. I just have to appreciate him,\u201d the chairman said.\n\nOssai Ovie Success, an aide to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, also commended Ikediashi for the venture. He said this venture is what the state has been praying for, that is individuals who will complement and support the programmes of the Delta state government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are seeing here today is an act of kindness. Health is wealth. When we are not strong, we cannot go about our daily pursuits. What he is doing will really reduce the rate of death and ill-health.\n\n\u201cPeople are happy seeing something like this. I have seen the medical personnel. They are committed to the work. The state government has actually done well in health delivery services. You cannot preach the gospel of stronger Delta or Think Delta First without the people being healthy.\u201d",

Ezeonu, of threats to our staff involved in the exercise in Ehime Mbano Local Government Area.\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has, however, distanced itself from the attack.\n\nIt warned those behind the barbaric attacks to stop or be ready to reap the reward of their atrocities.\n\nIn a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, the group alleged that the attackers were being sponsored by politicians to jeopardise its decision to actualize Biafra Republic.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe strongly condemn the attack on INEC staff at Ihite Uboma LGA of Imo State. We are also warning these traitors and enemies of Biafra behind these barbaric attacks to stop or be ready to reap the reward of their atrocities.\n\n\u201cIPOB cannot afford to allow them to continue to terrorise our people or demonise our peaceful organisation as some uninformed people are pointing accusing fingers at us.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not happy with these criminal activities going on in our region because we don\u2019t want this to continue and we are going to expose those behind this evil in the region.\n\n\u201cAnybody involved in this act will regret it. We totally disassociate from this act of criminality. IPOB volunteers and ESN have no hands in this criminal act that criminals randomly carry out against our people.\n\n\u201cThe masterminds are being sponsored by unfortunate politicians thinking they can jeopardise our decision to make Biafra freedom a reality.\n\n\u201cWe have made it clear to the public severally that IPOB members are not unknown gunmen and we cannot be because we have objective which is to restore Biafra as a free, independent and sovereign nation.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it publicly known that IPOB and its security units did not attack INEC officers in Imo State.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that Nigeria Government and their collaborators are sponsoring these criminal groups to attack our people in the name of IPOB to instigate crisis so people can disassociate themselves from IPOB activities and the entire world will see IPOB as terror group but they will fail and will not raise their ugly heads again. We promise them so.\n\n\u201cIPOB will not relent in discovering those behind this devilish activities and expose them.\u201d",

          "text": "THE Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has asked the Federal Government to be ruthless with bandits and other criminals behind the nation\u2019s heightening security challenges.\n\nIt pledged to work with the President to ensure that all necessary measures are put in place to reverse the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nNGF Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, spoke for the group during a visit to his Kaduna State counterpart, Nasir el-Rufai, over the recent train attack in the state.\n\nIn a statement issued late yesterday, NGF\u2019s spokesman, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, quoted Fayemi as saying: \u201cI agree that we as governors must join hands with the President to deal ruthlessly with the bandits, that they be crushed, as you have always advocated,\u201d referring to what El-Rufai had advocated before now.\n\nFayemi said he equally shares El-Rufai\u2019s suggestion that the Federal. Government takes proactive action by going after the bandits right in their enclaves and rooting them out.\n\nFayemi, who announced a N50 million donation, noted that the primary purpose of government is ensuring the safety of lives and property.\n\nHe added that with the current state of affairs, the impression in the minds of most Nigerians presently is that nothing is being done by the security agencies in the country to bring an end to this.\n\nFayemi said: \u201cWe are here to commiserate with you, your government and the people of Kaduna State; to show solidarity with them and align with the governor who, as a public servant all his life, has been a focused leader from who we must learn to ensure peace in our communities.\u201d\n\nThe NGF Chairman, who described the train attack as mind-boggling in view of the number of casualties and other fatalities, noted that the criminals were audacious enough to also take away some hostages, which raises the state of insecurity in the region to the level of uncertainties.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor wondered if the entire crime was the handiwork of some enemies of the state government or its governor who he said is transforming the state to their chagrin and are therefore working to distract the state from its path to development.\n\nFayemi regretted that everything is currently unnecessarily revolving around 2023, the election year, \u201cwhich we are not even sure we will be alive to see with the prevailing state of circumstances\u201d, and advised that more should be done towards securing the country.\n\nHe said the Northwest of the country had been a region of calm and consensus before now and emphasised that whatever it is to do, governors will continue to put heads together along with the President, who he said is also very worried about the sequence of attacks, to bring sanity back to the country.\n\nThe NGF chairman, who noted that the country was worth dying for regardless of whatever anyone thinks, advised El-Rufai not to relent in his efforts at building the state and to continue to be the leader that he has always been.\n\nEl-Rufai stated that the bandits behind the attack are currently hiding somewhere in Niger State.\n\nHe disclosed that there were 61 Kaduna indigenes still recuperating from the train attack, including a top government official and his eight-month pregnant wife.\n\nEl-Rufai regretted that the attack was avoidable because the state government had tipped the Nigeria Railways Corporation twice about the impending attack, pleading with the NRC to suspend night trains.\n\nHe added that when the NRC failed to act, the state government went to the Minister for Transportation, but still their complaints were not heeded.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor, who advised that the situation should not be treated with levity, noted that the state of things in the Northwest is worse than the Boko Haram of the Northeast, adding that there is an international dimension to it.\n\nEl Rufai showed his visitors a letter he said the state government was writing to the President on the issue.\n\nHe thanked the NGF delegation, which included Governor Muhammadu Badaru of Jigawa State, for its efforts and the donation.\n\nEarlier, Kaduna State Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, had called the train attack a demoralising experience which she prayed the state would never witness again.\n\nBalarabe said the NGF and its members have been such good friends whose support the state values and places high premium on.\n\nShe pledged that the Kaduna State Government would continue to do its best in supporting the security forces in the state to accomplish the task of securing lives and property while still working hard to find lasting solutions to the problem, in such a way that it never repeats itself.",

          "text": "There are indications that the federal government may have begun talks with the gunmen who attacked an Abuja-Kaduna train late last month, killing some of the passengers and abducting about 70 others.\n\nRelations of the kidnapped passengers told reporters in Kaduna yesterday that following the pressure they were exerting on the federal government, it had gone into talks with the terrorists on how to release those in captivity.\n\nSpokesman for the victims\u2019 relatives, Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, said that sequel to the 72-hour ultimatum they gave the federal government to act on the fate of the abducted people, \u201cwe are happy that the government has started discussing with the abductors of our relatives.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded with the authorities to speed up the negotiation so that the victims might be released as soon as possible.\n\nJimoh also warned the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) against the proposed resumption of train services without first rescuing the kidnapped victims.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we gave the Federal Government a 72-hour ultimatum which expired yesterday (Thursday) midnight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to God that before the expiration of the 72 hours, we heard from the Federal Government after the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday through the Minister of Information that the government is already on top of the situation with what has happened.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge it and we appreciate it. But what we want to add is that the government should speed up the process of discussion with them (bandits) so that they can release our people soonest. This is our appeal now.\u201d\n\nOn reports that the NRC was in the process of resuming the Abuja-Kaduna service, Jimoh said the organisation should not be talking about that now \u201cwhen our people are in captivity, because what is the assurance that if they resume now people that will be boarding the train are safe?\n\n\u201cWhat measure(s) have they put in place to guarantee the security of those that are going to patronise their services? We don\u2019t want a reoccurrence of this.\n\n\u201cThe first thing should be to get the captives out and then they can put adequate measures in place and resume services so that this does not happen again in future.\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that they won\u2019t try it, and if they do, we won\u2019t take it lightly with them because human lives are involved.\n\n\u201cWe believe they won\u2019t because they know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nAmaechi chose wrong time to declare presidential ambition \u2013 Fatima Ciroma\n\nHajiya Fatima Ciroma, a relation of another victim, expressed disappointment at Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi for choosing a time like this to launch his presidential bid.\n\nHer words: \u201cThe NRC mooting the idea of resuming train services\u2019 is inhuman. It is not good at all.\n\n\u201cThe authorities need to sit down and think of how to rescue those in captivity and not the resumption of train services.\n\n\u201cWhat are train services compared to human lives? That means human lives are not valued by the authorities.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Transportation is not helpful. He shouldn\u2019t be elected at all if this is what he has to offer.\u201d\n\nTerrorists called me 11 times, told why they\u2019re attacking Kaduna \u2013 Atta\n\nA third relation, Dr. Abdulkarim Atta, said the abductors have reached out to him 11 times, and told him that \u201cthey had their targets\u201d in ill-fated train.\n\nHe said the terrorist told him that it was unfortunate that other people were taken away by them.\n\nAtta, whose 85-year-old mother and sister are among the kidnapped, said that he was allowed by the bandits to talk to his aged mother and sister before the release of the Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan.\n\nHe added that the gunmen told him in the course of their discussion that \u201cthe state governor, (Malam Nasir El-Rufai) has been running his mouth and that was why they came to his doorstep and that this is just the beginning. That they would go further than this. I spoke with them.\u201d\n\nSani Lawal said: \u201cMy brother Hassan and his sister-in-law are being held by the bandits. We are deeply concerned that the government is not showing enough concern.\n\n\u201cUp till date, no government delegation has called upon us to sympathise or show concern.\n\n\u201cLet us warn the NRC not to contemplate or attempt to resume train services without rescuing our loved ones in the den of the bandits.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the NRC is only thinking of how to make money without even thinking of how to put in measures to forestall a repeat of incident in future.\u201d\n\nKwankwaso knocks FG over inability to rescue abducted passengers\n\nFormer Kano State governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has deplored the seeming \u201cindifference\u201d of the Federal Government to the rescue of passengers who were abducted in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack as worrisome.\n\nThe former governor and national leader of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) predicted that the 2023 election will be a revolution by the Nigerian masses to remove the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) \u201cfor a new Nigeria\u201d .\n\nSpeaking in his Abuja home yesterday, Kwankwaso said the thought of building upon what has been done by this government was repulsive to Nigerians who have on a daily basis witnessed the failings which they did not bargain for.\n\nAccording to him, as a former minister of Defence, he was shocked that insecurity in the country will escalate within a short period of time.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am sure every military man or anybody like me who had the opportunity to associate with the military must be very worried on one hand and would also be surprised with what is happening in the country.\n\n\u201cWe heard what happened recently concerning the train attack. Before then, it was the only hope that Nigerians were having to go to Kaduna and link up to other places.\n\n\u201cMany people advised that the train would be attacked, but nothing was done and people were killed and abducted. Only God knows what they are experiencing, but we know it is horrible.\n\n\u201cThey are really not talking about how these people who were kidnapped should be rescued. Government should be more serious about security.\n\n\u201cAs a former minister of defence, I never thought insecurity would go this low in this country within the short period of time.\n\n\u201cI always sit down to ask myself that how do we find ourselves in this mess? What really happened? But as we always say, our issue is leadership\u201d.\n\nKwankwaso noted further that the current political leadership was not strong enough to motivate the military and to ensure that they are given what they require in terms of training, equipment, arms and ammunition.\n\nInsisting that the APC has failed to provide leadership and good governance for Nigerians, he said NNPP would take over leadership of the country come 2023.\n\n\u201cThey have the opportunity to do something for this country but they didn\u2019t. Nigerians are angry. Nigerians would do whatever they can to vote and protect their vote.\n\n\u201cAll those involved in the elections, even security, are not happy. The election of 2023 will be between those who are happy with the system and those who want change.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that those who are not happy are much.\u201d",

          "title": "Tanko Yakasai: How Buhari\u2019s govt can stop insecurity",
          "text": "Alhaji Tanko Yakasai is an elder statesman and Second Republic politician. The nonagenarian, who was then President Shehu Shagari\u2019s Political Adviser, in this interview with Saturday Sun, insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration lacks the competence and capacity to end the present insecurity bedevilling the land, even as he lamented that the problems that gave birth to NEPU and ushered in the Sawaba Declaration of the 50s were still prevalent in today\u2019s Nigeria today. He spoke to DESMOND MGBOH in Kano.\n\nYour son, Salihu, just defected from the APC to the PRP. In his remarks, he made strong reference to the Sawaba Declaration. As a founding member of NEPU and a key signatory to the SAWABA declaration, how do you feel that the new generation of politicians are moving back to NEPU and the PRP?\n\nWell, it is inevitable because the conditions that led to the creation of NEPU and PRP and the rest of them are still there or are coming back all over again. When NEPU was founded, the slogan was emancipation and that was Sawaba. There were too much problems in the society at that time and the people were looking for reprieve. And some people thought of establishing a political party that would fight for that reprieve. And the purpose was to liberate the common people of the region from the oppression, poverty and lack of clear direction for the future occasioned by their leaders. So that was what brought about NEPU then. But unfortunately, because of military coup, all the political parties were banned, NEPU among them. But after about 13 years, when the ban on politics and political activities were lifted, some people went back to the issue of NEPU, went back to revive it and luckily for them, at that time, the leader of NEPU had some issues with the National Movement and he left. They got him as a rallying point and he helped them revive the agitation for the liberation and emancipation of the people of the region. As a result of that, they created a new political party, Peoples Redemption Party. So redemption and emancipation and liberation are the same thing. So, I am not surprised that today, the old belief is coming back again and there are a couple of very credible names that are associated with the PRP, because honestly speaking the problems that were prevalent then have not been solved and the need for a stronger push for liberation in the society is still as evident as it was in the past.\n\nDoes the PRP have the prospect of coming back to seize control of the politics of some parts of North, like Kano and Kaduna State, places where they were very popular in the Second Republic?\n\nYes I do see their chances because as far as I am concerned, they are still popular in all those areas that you just mentioned. This is because the changes that have happened in the lives of the people in those areas are not significant or any much different from what they were in past. The people of these states and region are still waiting for emancipation and the people are thinking randomly, let us go back to the original struggle for the emancipation of our people.\n\nFormer Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has just defected from the PDP to his NNPP. What is your take about this defection?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know and I never discussed with him about his motivations, but I guess that he is virtually looking for an opportunity, to use his influence in Kano and support somebody to emerge as the Governor of Kano State. I think he is not too keen on his own candidature as he is on winning the election in Kano State. I think he is looking for a platform where he can sponsor somebody with the support that he has here in Kano to emerge as the governor of the state. He would certainly make a huge difference if he is able to get somebody to be elected as a governor on his platform in Kano and a few states of Northern Nigeria.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAt the national level, what are his chances? We do know that he has a presidential aspiration. What are the chances his NNPP would make impact in 2023 elections?\n\nI think he is seeing the magnitude of the ambition to be elected the President of Nigeria, the costs, the reach out and the rest of them and probably, he thinks that time is not enough given that between now to the date of the election is a matter of months, certainly not years. And he must have worked out that time is not opportune for him to make an impact as a candidate for the Presidency. He would not come out and say it but I think that is not his motive. It is just like what Mallam Aminu Kano did. You see when Mallam realised that the National Movement could not provide him a platform for the Presidency, he decided to come back to Kano and eventually, he succeeded in forming the governments of Kano and Kaduna States. I think that this history is there in the psyche of Kwankwaso and I will not be surprised if he is not trying to repeat history.\n\nLooking at his rivals in Kano State- Ganduje in APC and Ibrahim Shekarau- a man that has blind political followership, what are his chances of using this new party to produce the next governor of the state?\n\nIf you look at the situation, I don\u2019t think there is a single leader among the three of them who is sure of getting the votes in Kano to produce the governor. But this is an electoral system whereby out of the three or four or five candidates, whoever emerges with the largest number of votes can be elected as the governor. You don\u2019t have to have all the votes to yourself before you become or you will be declared the winner and the governor of the state. You can win the election with a few thousand votes difference; you don\u2019t have to have an overwhelming majority over everybody. You can even win by just one vote. If you understand it this way, you will see his reasoning\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the insecurity in different parts of the country, but which is much more in the North. How do you feel about the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna terror attack, which occurred a few days after we had the airport attack in the same Kaduna?\n\nWell, this incident is most unfortunate and I want to extend my sincere sympathies to the families of the deceased. I also want to empathise with those who were injured and I am praying for those who are presently in hostage to regain their freedom soonest. You see, this problem is a national problem and we need a national government with social and military programmes to address properly the issue of insecurity and other problems in the land. This is because insecurity is largely associated with poverty and unemployment. To solve the problem of insecurity in Nigeria, you have to tackle the problem of unemployment in the country and then, poverty. Because those who are engaged to undermine security in Nigeria are largely people who do not have jobs or any serious thing that they are doing. To resolve this problem of insecurity, you have to come up with a policy programme that would not address one problem, but would address a number of interrelated problems, to address inter \u2013 related social problems that are driving insecurity.\n\nBut honestly speaking do you think President Buhari and his security apparatus in Nigeria can tackle the problem of insecurity in the country?\n\nYou know my position on this, right from the world go. You know my position about the President. By the time he was to contest for the position, I did not support him. I said that I did not support him to some journalists in the past and they asked me why. And I said that he has no capacity and competence to tackle the problem. And seven years is gone, the problem of insecurity in Nigeria has not been tackled or addressed. It has gone worse from where we are\n\nHow do you say that a retired General cannot tackle insecurity?\n\nYou cannot change somebody. This man joined the military when he was about 20 years old and now he is 80. You cannot change him. Look at during Obasanjo, when there was problem at Zaki Ibiam and one other area, what did he do? He ordered the military to move in. That is to tell you that you don\u2019t change people simply because he dropped the khaki and picked up an agbada. You don\u2019t change people. Until the end of his life, he would think in a military way.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAre you saying that it is not all about military force?\n\nWhat people with the right capacity do is that they look for people with great ideas from different vocations, regardless of whether they are from their party or not, and then tell them the problems worrying you. You urge them to think and come out with the solution to enable you tackle the problem. And when they put their heads together, they would come up with a number of recommendations out of which you can pick those that could be handled immediately. And in a matter of one year or so, you will begin to see a difference. This is the reason why when you are in politics and when you are in government, you make out your priority. Priority is the thing that requires your immediate attention and can be immediately addressed while you address others in the future.\n\nA lot of analysts believe that part of the problems of security in Northern Nigeria is the open international borders of the region. Quite a number of the terrorists are people from outside our borders. Let me have your honest take on this .\n\nOpen borders is not the major problem. The major problem, I told you, is when you produce millions of young people without anything for them to do to take care of themselves. This is the problem. Massive unemployment in the country, no education and even those who are educated are half- baked. You can\u2019t call them educated people. Yes they can read and right, but you know that they are not educated. So this problem of some people moving from outside the borders is a problem, but it is not the main problem. The major problem in this country is with the people of this country and it is because the younger generations that are coming up have no hope in the country and have no one to care for their needs. I mean they would like to get married, they would like to stay with their families and they would like to have prospects. But there is no hope in Nigeria. And when somebody has no hope, he takes to criminality to ease out his frustration. Because killing people does not solve their problems. This insurgency that they are doing, does it solve their problems? No! They go and kill people and steal their money and they would spend it on useless things. They don\u2019t use the money they receive from banditry and others for any useful thing. It is so frustrating. So you need to have experts. In fact I will advise that whoever would emerge as the next President should not limit himself to Nigeria or to Africa. He should look wider and further for assistance by way of ideas to solve the problems of insecurity and they would come to his help\n\nThere are arguments that there must be those who are benefiting from within as a result of which this insecurity problem has remained unsolvable. What would say to this?\n\nWell, If you remember the Late Chief of Defence Staff, Barde. When he died, he left billions of naira. How did he get all that money? He would go to President Jonathan and outline the solutions to the problem, and that this was how much it would cost, and Jonathan would direct that he should be given the money and when he got the money, he would take it for himself. This is what happened. Otherwise, how could he have got all those billions of naira? And he is not himself alone. There are many, many people like that in the system. There are many Bardes who are making their own money under the guise of fighting insecurity and insurgency in the country. This is one of the reasons we are not solving the problem because the monies that are allocated to solve the problem, they are not all being used to tackle the problem.\n\nYou have been an advocate of the emergence of a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction. Has your position changed about the Igbo Presidency?\n\nI said that I am in support of a President of Igbo extraction for Nigeria. But I made it clear at the time, nobody can gift you the Presidency in a democracy. Igbo people would have to go out in a country like Nigeria, with millions of people, you have to reach out to the left, right and centre. You have to not only reach out to people, but present them with a programme that would take care of your interests and their interests. It is not only about your own interests but also about their own interests. If their interests are not incorporated in your own programme, they would not support you. So the question of reaching out with a viable programme that would address the problems of different segments of the Nigeria society is a must. And that is what will begin to appeal to them, that if this man would get to power, our problems would be solved. If not all but partly. Without that, you can shout at the top of your voice about the Presidency, and nothing would change.\n\nFrom your assessment of those Igbo who have indicated interest in the Presidency, do you think that they have been reaching out enough?\n\nWell, my trouble is how many months now do we have left to the elections and what are the platforms that they are using to pursue their quest?.Because the most important thing is the platform. If the platform is nationwide in character, there is hope. But if the platform is not nationwide, if it is limited to your locality, there is no way, there is no magic that anybody can make to make you win the elections.\n\nBut do you see them making enough efforts to get the nod of the players on the big platforms\n\nHonestly their approach to addressing this problem is a challenge to me. Instead of trying to get very good platforms, they tend to create mushroom organisations that are limited to their own locality. I don\u2019t think that that is the way to go about it. You must launch yourselves into the Nigerian nation; seek out platforms that are national in character and take it up from there. This is because you need everybody. Without reaching out to all, there is no amount of shout that you make that would make you win the heart of people. Let them look for a viable platform, join it, make an impact. But as long as they are in APGA and the rest of them which are limited to Igbo land, they cannot give an Igbo man a platform to be elected as the President of Nigeria.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the last APC Convention which produced mostly consensus candidates?\n\nConsensus is not democracy. Nobody would tell you that democracy means consensus. No! Democracy means majority. So, consensus was not there before. It was not a platform that was to take anyone to power. I saw it, it happened. The President said that they could not afford the competition and contest as a party. In my opinion, if they had allowed true democracy to go ahead, the same outcome could have been arrived at. Adamu would have emerged the winner through a democratic process. I was telling somebody yesterday, when Ambode was not towing the lines of the party in Lagos State and they decided to remove him , what did Tinubu do? They had caucuses all over the place and they held a meeting and they spoke freely. Tinubu didn\u2019t utter a word and from their remarks, you would know that they were against Ambode and when the votes were cast, they rejected him and looked for another candidate.\n\nThere is a general feeling that the APC would pay dearly for the use of consensus arrangement because many of their members are not happy the way things went. Do you see this things playing out this way?\n\nIn any case, I told you that consensus negates democracy and what is known to democracy is majority votes. You know that those who withdrew didn\u2019t withdraw voluntarily. They withdrew to submit to bigger power because, as you know, from now to the end of his tenure there are a lot of things that Buhari can do. And most of these aspirants were former governors who have some problems and he has his own information about everybody and everybody knows that he has that information. The moment you attempt to revolts, all he needs to do is to keep you quiet and let you go but then in the next few days, you will be in trouble with the authorities and this is the reason they conceded against their wish. They know. They were former officials who have skeletons in their cupboards and can\u2019t afford to disobey the Presidential directive.",

          "text": "\n\n*Rejects Atuche, two others\n\n*Buhari meets CDS, Service Chiefs Tuesday\n\n*FG to conduct census in April, 2023\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe deteriorating security condition in the country was the focus of the first meeting of the National Council of State (NCS) this year, which held yesterday in Abuja, with the governors taking turns to brief the gathering on the situation in their respective states.\n\n\n\nThe meeting, presided by President Muhammadu Buhari, and attended by past Heads of State and presidents, granted state pardon to former Governors Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame of Plateau and Taraba states, respectively, who were serving jail terms for corruption.\n\n\n\nThe two former governors were among 159 convicts pardoned by the council at the meeting held at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja.\n\nBut the council rejected the application for prerogative of mercy for a former Managing Director of the defunct Bank PHB, Francis Atuche, who was convicted for stealing and jailed last year. Two other applications were also disallowed.\n\n\n\nBuhari would follow up the discussions at the NCS gathering with a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) to review the current security situation in the country. The security council comprises Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), the three service chiefs, Inspector General of Police, and others from the military brass.\n\n\n\nThe NCS approved a national population census for April 2023, after the general election slated for February and March 2023.\n\n\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the NCS meeting, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State disclosed that the president would meet security chiefs on Tuesday over the worsening security situation following recommendations and comments by members of the council of state.\n\n\n\nBadaru said, \u201cThe issue of security was brought before the council and it was discussed. Suggestions were made by the state governments and some of the members of the council, and President Muhammadu Buhari promised to call a security meeting to discuss the issues raised on Tuesday so that we will have enhanced security in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president was more concerned also about food security and the need for a secure country where farmers would go back to land and continue to produce and it is observed that we are by and large food secured. And, in fact, we are feeding the neighbouring countries also because of the worldwide cost in food around the world and most of the neighbouring countries find Nigerian food cheaper.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, there is need for enhanced production, so that you will not only meet the Nigerian demand, but also the neighbouring countries\u2019 demand and the president promised to discuss this with the service chiefs on Tuesday. So that adequate security arrangement will continue to flow based on the advice he received today from the various governors and also from members of the council.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking also, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said the council approved 159 out of 162 applications for prerogative of mercy for convicts and inmates in correctional centres across the country. Malami said the recommendation came after the council received the report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy.\n\n\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cIn the exercise of the powers on the granting of pardon, precisely on the 28th day of August 2018, the president put in place a committee known as the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy, which was saddled with the responsibility of visiting the country\u2019s correctional facilities and making recommendations to the president on the exercise of his power of mercy and compassion, by way of either granting pardon to those that have been convicted, clemency, or some other form of concessions by way of reduction in sentence and term.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was in exercise such duties and responsibility, in line with the terms of the Committee on Prerogative of Mercy, that we presented the report to the president and the requirement of the law on the exercise of that mercy and pardon (is that we) should seek the advice of the Council of State.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn line with that, a memo was presented by the president this afternoon to the council through which the report of the committee was presented to council for its advice. The committee made a submission of 162 people presented to the president for such consideration.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-six of the inmates are recommended for presidential pardon, 85 of surviving ex-convicts were recommended for presidential pardon, one deceased person was recommended for posthumous presidential pardon, 27 inmates were recommended for presidential clemency, 13 inmates were recommended for a review of their sentences or prison terms, 10 inmates were presented for a reduced sentence from death to life imprisonment. In total, 162 convicts were presented for the president\u2019s consideration for pardon and mercy.\u201d\n\nMalami said the council rejected proposal to grant pardon to one of the prisoners sentenced to 120 years for stealing over N25 billion. He said the pardon was sought due a life threatening illness.\n\n\n\nThe second inmate was convicted for forgery and sentenced to 14 years in jail, and he had stayed in prison for a year and six months, while the third person, who obtained money by false pretence, was sentenced for seven years, he said.\n\nMalami stressed that the council was not satisfied with reasons adduced for the pardon of the three convicts and, therefore, rejected them.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, said the council approved the conferment of National Honours Award on 434 Nigerians, who distinguished themselves in their various field of endeavour.\n\nThe council gave approval for a national headcount to hold in April 2023 after the general election. This would be preceded by a Pilot Census to be conducted by National Population Commission (NPC) in June 2022 after political parties\u2019 primary elections.\n\n\n\nNPC Director General, Nasir Isa-Kwarra, said the commission would deploy technology in the conduct of the national census. Isa-Kwarra said through census, data was generated for planning, noting that the data currently being used are mere projections and obsolete.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is very crucial because I have highlighted that the census is a very important exercise for the nation. Through census we generate the data that we use for policy making, for planning, for development, by the three tiers of government, and the private sector, they all need this.\n\n\u201cIf you are in private sector, you\u2019re producing something, certainly, you need to know the population of an area if you want to create a market there.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo census data is very crucial, very important. Because, the data we\u2019ve been using are just projections, estimation and are sort of obsolete, we need the actual census data to use for our planning.\u201d\n\nAt the commencement of the meeting, the council observed a minute silence in honour of former Head of Interim National Government (ING), Chief Ernest Shonekan, who died on January 11, 2022.\n\n\n\nThis was the fourth time Buhari would chair the NCS meeting in seven years, with the first held on October 21, 2015, the second on September 7, 2016, and the third held virtually in August 2020.\n\nThe National Council of State is an organ of the federal government saddled with the responsibility of advising the executive on policy-making matters.\n\n\n\nMembers of the council include the president, vice president, past presidents, Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker, Chief Justice of Nigeria, serving and past.\n\n\n\nOthers are Attorney General of the Federation, all state governors, and Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThose who attended the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\n\n\nFormer Heads of State physically in attendance were General Yakubu Gowon, General Abdusalami Abubakar, and former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nOthers attended the meeting virtually from their various locations.\n\nState governors in attendance included Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Atiku Bagudu(Kebbi), Bello Matawalle (Zamfara), and Nasir El Rufai (Kaduna).

          "text": "\n\n*Approves N4trn Subsidy\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\nFollowing public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had seen the country lose huge earnings as well as hobbled its ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday constituted a 13-member Adhoc Committee to investigate oil theft in Nigeria and its impact on petroleum production and oil revenues.\n\nThe composition of the panel was announced on the floor at plenary.\n\n\n\nLawan named Senator Bassey Albert Akpan as Chairman of the Committee.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators Yusuf A. Yusuf, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Kabiru Gaya, Mohammed Adamu Aliero, George Thompson Sekibo and Gabriel Suswam.\n\n\n\nThe panel also included Senators Kashim Shettima, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Ali Ndume, Stella Oduah, Sani Musa and Ibrahim Gobir.\n\n\n\nThe adhoc committee was given one month to conclude work on investigations and report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, the Senate approved a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAlso, the Senate approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval.\n\n\n\nThe president, had in a letter to the legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\n\n\nHe had disclosed that 138 of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe National Assembly in December, 2021, had approved the sum of N442.7 billion for subsidy in the 2022 budget for the period of January to June this year.\n\n\n\nBuhari, however, anchored his fresh request on the fact that petrol subsidy was not duly appropriated for in the national budget beyond June.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the development was as a result of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act which stops all such payments past the given June deadline.\n\n\n\nIn another letter dated 12th April, 2022, Buhari had requested the National Assembly to approve an additional N1 trillion to his earlier N2.557 subsidy request to bring the total amount on payments to N4 trillion for the year 2022.\n\nThe approval came with the passage of a bill to amend the 2022 Appropriations Act transmitted to the National Assembly on 10th February, 2022, by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration.\n\n\n\nThe Senate in December, 2021, had passed a budget of N17,126,873,917,692 trillion.\n\nThe revised sum of N17.3 trillion in contrast with the 2022 budget of N17.13 trillion passed last year, represented a N193 billion increase.\n\n\n\nThe passage of the Appropriations Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe figure represented an increase of N192.5 billion from the N17.1 trillion approved and assented to last December.\n\n\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriation Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill in both chambers.\n\nThe nation\u2019s parliament increased its annual budget by N12 billion. It was N139 billion in the 2022 budget but has now increased to N153 billion in the revised version, approved yesterday.\n\n\n\nA critical analysis of the revised budget showed that there was no increment in the capital vote of N5.415 trillion\n\nThe increment affected only the recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\nOut of the total sum of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion passed, N817,699,410,210 billion is for Statutory Transfers; N3,978,087,110,437 trillion for Debt Service; N7,108,621,131,849 trillion for Recurrent (Non-Debt Expenditure); and N5,415,296,438,523 trillion for Contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the additional request was against the backdrop of adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework which became imperative due to market developments occasioned by the spike in crude prices, following the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\n\n\nThe chamber, accordingly, approved the President\u2019s request for additional N3.557 trillion for PMS subsidy with the passage of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt also approved N192.52 billion aggregate increase sought by the executive, and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force to enhance their morale.\n\n\n\nThe Senate, after passing the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, adjourned till the 26th of April, 2021\n\nThe Senate had before the approval, considered the report of its Committee on Finance on the Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper, laid by the Chairman, Senator Olamilekan Adeola.\n\n\n\nThe red chamber, in the MTEF/FSP approved oil benchmark $73 per barrel as proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\n\nIt also approved oil production volume of 1.600m per day.\n\nThe chamber gave its nod for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "US Report: Nigerian Judicial Officers Demand Bribe for Favourable Rulings",
          "text": "*Alleges EFCC, ICPC only after low-level corruption cases\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by the United States Department of State has alleged that the judiciary in Nigeria remains susceptible to corruption and is constantly under pressure from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\n\n\nIn its \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021,\u201d the US stated that although the constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, political leaders influence the judges and lawyers, particularly at the state and local government levels.\n\n\n\nThe document added that there was a widespread public perception that judges were easily bribed, and litigants could not rely on the courts to render impartial judgments.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany citizens encountered long delays and reported receiving requests from judicial officials for bribes to expedite cases or obtain favourable rulings,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\n\nIt listed understaffing, inefficiency, and corruption as factors preventing the judiciary from functioning adequately.\n\nOther challenges, the US stated, included the absence of continuing education requirements for attorneys coupled with the fact that police officers were often assigned to serve as prosecutors.\n\n\n\nIt alleged that judges frequently fail to appear for trials, stressing however that the salaries of court officials are low, and officials often lacked proper equipment and training.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe constitution and the annual appropriation acts stipulate that the National Assembly and the judiciary be paid directly from the federation account as statutory transfers before other budgetary expenditures are made to maintain their autonomy and separation of powers.\n\n\n\n\u201cFederal and state governments, however, often undermined the judiciary by withholding funding and manipulating appointments,\u201d the US report noted.\n\n\n\nOn problems with trial procedures, the US posited that although defendants were presumed innocent and enjoy certain rights, authorities do not always respect these rights, most frequently due to a lack of capacity.\n\n\u201cInsufficient number of judges and courtrooms, together with growing caseloads, often resulted in pre-trial, trial, and appellate delays that could extend a trial for as many as 10 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough accused persons are entitled to counsel of their choice, there were reportedly some cases where defence counsel was absent from required court appearances so regularly that a court might proceed with a routine hearing in the absence of counsel, except for certain offences for which conviction carries the death penalty,\u201d it alleged.\n\n\n\nAccording to the document, in some cases, the police would demand additional payment from family members who wanted to attend a trial even as the authorities could hold defendants in prison awaiting trial for periods well beyond the terms allowed by law.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the document alleged that Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as well as the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) were mainly focused on pursuing low and mid-level corruption cases.\n\n\n\nThe US stated that although there had been a few indictments of active top level government officials, the cases were being hampered by administrative delays.\n\nThe US document stated: \u201cThe ICPC holds broad authority to prosecute most forms of corruption. The EFCC\u2019s writ extends only to financial and economic crimes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the ICPC and EFCC\u2019s anti-corruption efforts remained focused on low- and mid-level government officials, although both organisations brought indictments against various active and former high-level government officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany of the corruption cases, particularly the high-profile ones, remained pending before the courts due to administrative or procedural delays.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the law provides criminal penalties for conviction of official corruption, the government, the US report stated, did not consistently implement the law, and government employees, including elected officials, frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cMassive, widespread, and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government, including the judiciary and security services.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office. There were numerous allegations of government corruption during the year,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nOn the government\u2019s posture towards human rights abuses, the report noted government officials sometimes cooperated and responded to such cases, but generally either dismissed allegations, did not provide substantive response, or did not publicise outcomes of investigations.\n\n\n\nThe document added that in the north-east, there had been reports that the military threatened civil society groups and humanitarian organisations after aid provided by the organisations purportedly reached insurgent groups.\n\n\n\nEven though the law establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as an independent non-judicial mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights, it noted that the role of the body has been largely advisory as well as for training and advocacy purposes.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the year, there were no reports of its (NHRC) prior investigations having led to accountability. The law provides for recognition and enforcement of damages awarded to plaintiffs, but it was unclear whether this happened,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\n\nOn insurgency in the North-east by the militant terrorist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), it noted that the terrorists continued to conduct numerous attacks on government and civilian targets, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries.\n\n\n\nAccording to the US report, this has led to the internal displacement of more than three million persons, and the external displacement of more than an estimated 327,000 Nigerian refugees to neighbouring countries as of the year\u2019s end.\n\n\n\nQuoting the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the document noted that more than 24,000 persons were registered as missing in the country, with the majority from the conflict area in the North-east.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. According to Amnesty International, the whereabouts of at least 50 suspected supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group arrested in Rivers State between October and November 2020 remained unknown at year\u2019s end,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stressed that ineffective and non-existent civil registration and identification management systems in areas hosting displaced persons, refugees, and returnees remained a concern.\n\n\n\nFor refugees, the report pointed out that even when civil documents were obtained, community members and local officials were sometimes unaware of their legal rights or standing, which could also prevent them from moving freely, obtaining work, or accessing health care.\n\n\n\nDuring the year, the US posited that ISIS-WA terrorists demonstrated increased ability to conduct complex attacks against military outposts and formations.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the year ISIS-WA terrorists took over significant territory formerly held by Boko Haram. ISIS-WA expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of Borno State,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nIn the South-east, it stated that following IPOB\u2019s launch of its military wing, the Eastern Security Network, in December 2020, in the first quarter of the year, local media reported 54 violent attacks on civilians and security forces and 222 deaths, representing a 59 per cent and 344 per cent increase, respectively, compared with the quarter prior to its establishment.\n\n\n\nIt stated that while some reports estimated the number of Boko Haram and ISIS-WA abductees at more than 2,000, the total count of the missing was unknown as towns repeatedly changed hands, and many families were still on the run or dispersed in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",
          "summary": "The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump.\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin.\nThe voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria?

Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "According to the most recent statistics, Nigerian moviegoers paid more for action films in 2021. According to Insightful cinema, the genre grossed over N2.3 billion in Nigerian cinemas in 2021, making it the highest-earning movie genre, with Hollywood accounting for 67 percent (36) of all action movies exhibited.\n\nFollowing one of the most substantial dips in the industry\u2019s history as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the total year revenue drop to just N2.1 billion by the end of 2020 from almost N7 billion in 2019, cinema revenue rose to N4.9 billion by the end of 2021, with the action movie genre being the year\u2019s top choice among moviegoers.\n\nBox Office giants like Spider-Man: No Way Home( N526 million) which is the movie of the year and the most successful at the box office domestically and globally, \u2018Fast and Furious 9\u2019(N233.6 million), and \u2018No Time To Die(N190.7 million) was the top three highest-grossing action movies in 2021.\n\nWith a combined gross of N95.2 million, Nollywood action films such as \u2018Devil in Agbada\u2019, \u2018Mamba\u2019s Diamond\u2019, and \u2018The Cleanser\u2019 were the highest-grossing Nollywood action films. The industry did not fare as well as its Hollywood rivals, with films such as \u2018Eagle Wing\u2019, a Nigerian war action film with a budget of N145 million, grossing only N8.9 million at the box office in 2021.\n\nPatrick Enaholo of the School of Media and Communication, Pan-Atlantic University, Nigeria, spoke with BusinessDay on why Nollywood had such low numbers in terms of production and gross in the genre.\n\n\u201cTo make a decent action film, two things are required: first, a sufficient market budget such as Funke Akindeles\u2019 \u2018Omo Ghetto the Saga,\u2019 which has seen success locally and even beat international movies at the box office; Second, the industry needs more franchise movies that have a lot of anticipation from movie fans,\u201d Enaholo said.\n\nHe went on to explain that creating a big splash at the box office necessitates being based on excellent storylines that people are familiar with, citing the most recent James Bond film as an example of a popular series with a good plotline.\n\nTemi Olaoluwa, a documentary filmmaker, discussed the lack of adequate stuntmen for required stunts on set, insurance for those stuntmen, and inadequate equipment or camera to get a specific shot of a stunt without having to repeat the stunts, which could endanger the stunt man or waste money on props as all the reason for the low number of the action genre in the Nollywood movie industry.\n\nThe adventure film genre came in second, grossing over N1.6 billion from 30 films across all industries, while the drama film genre came in third, grossing over N1.5 billion from 119 films, and ending the billion club, comedy came in fourth grossing a little over N1billion.\n\nIn 2021, the drama genre accounted for little under 80 percent of the 124 Nollywood films that were released in theaters. This means that Nollywood was responsible for 81 percent (96) of the 119 drama films.\n\nThere were 23 Nollywood movies in the Comedy category, accounting for barely 19 percent of all films in the industry. On average, Nollywood comedy films gross $6 million more than drama films.\n\nRead also: AMAA short film festival: Startimes adds prize for best documentary\n\nFive Nollywood films made the top ten grossing films in 2021, garnering about N950 million in total, while the top five Hollywood films grossed N1.2 billion in cinemas last year.\n\nTop 5 highest-grossing action films in Nigeria at the box office in 2021\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home( N526 million)\n\nTom Holland\u2019s Peter Parker has traveled so far from his enjoyable low-key Homecoming, his secret identity revealed thanks to \u2018Far From Home\u2019, that he must literally gamble with fate reaching far beyond his own universe.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home swiftly became the most anticipated film of the year for many fans, thanks to the brand\u2019s popularity and online speculations regarding returning characters from previous Spider-man franchises. Audiences flocked to see the picture over and over again when the final product managed to live up to expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that No Way Home became the only film to reach the $1 billion mark worldwide and capture the title of best-grossing film of 2021.\n\nFast and Furious 9\u2019(N233.6 million)\n\nWith this being the ninth edition in the Fast and Furious franchise, fans were excited to see John Cena join an already star-studded ensemble, as well as the return of Han (Sung Kang) as the franchise retcons the character\u2019s death.\n\nNo Time To Die (N190.7 million)\n\nNo Time To Die is another movie that has been finished for a good year. It has just been sitting around, gathering dust, and waiting to be released. But the movie was worth the wait, as it\u2019s the perfect ending to Daniel Craig\u2019s tenure as James Bond\n\nShang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (N178.6 million)\n\nWhen it came to the hype, the film marked the MCU\u2019s true return to the big screen, with viewers loving the martial arts action sequences and Chinese culture.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings grossed $432 million worldwide, despite the fact that it didn\u2019t play on a single screen in China.\n\nThe Eternals (N129 million)\n\nLove it or hate it, there was no denying that there was widespread interest in seeing the unique film and the curiosity was enough to push the divisive blockbuster into the top 10 grossing films of the year.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, commissioned 68 housing units, under the National Housing Programme (NHP) Phase 1, in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nObaseki, at the unveiling of the units, called for increased collaboration between the state and federal governments, as well as other stakeholders to address the housing deficit in the country.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the National Bureau of Statistics has shown, we have over twenty million housing deficit in Nigeria, which means that very many Nigerians are living without proper shelter. The World Bank recommends at least a million homes annually to bridge this gap.\n\n\u201cBut due to limited resources and economic challenges, it is difficult for us to attain this goal. It is very important to encourage all partners, particularly the federal government, that collaboration is very key. While we congratulate them and appreciate what they have done, we are saying that the road ahead is very long.\n\n\u201cThe pace at which we are going is very slow. We need to change the strategy; 65 units of housing after nine years of construction will not solve our problems. We need to do more, and as a state, we are going to collaborate with the federal government to achieve the desired goals.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile considering the gains of this project, it\u2019s pertinent to note and underscore the need to develop other aspects of the housing industry that will help us move at a much faster pace and one of them is mortgages. Unless we introduce a virile, realistic, and affordable mortgage arrangement we will not be able to develop housing as we want to.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we are very committed to housing projects. As we speak, we have about four projects which we are working on already.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe are prepared to work with all partners including the federal government and communities to make sure that we take the issue of housing development very seriously. We would like to collaborate with the federal government. We hope that the next phase will not be developed the way this one has been developed.\n\n\u201cWe have more land, so we shouldn\u2019t be doing housing like this on four hectares. We have more land to give to you; we also understand some of the challenges you faced, but those challenges can be overcome. We need to collaborate closely.\n\n\u201cI believe that the dream of the federal government to tackle her housing deficit will be best accomplished with a closer working collaboration with states so that we can jointly build houses for Nigerians at the rate which we need to build. If we go on at this rate, half of us will be on the street.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, President Buhari, who was represented by Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, commended the state government for providing the land and the host community for their cooperation in ensuring the project is completed.\n\n\u201cThis is a benefit of inter-government collaboration despite the political divide. This is one of the first phases of the several phases of the Federal Government Housing projects since 2016.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Olamilekan Adeola.(APC \u2013 Lagos).\n\nSenate accordingly approved the $73 dollars per barrel proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari, including approving oil production volume of 1.600 million per day;\n\nA Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy of N4 trillion; and a cut in the provision for Federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80.\n\nWhile approving an increase in the Federal Government Independent Revenue of N400 billion, Senate gave its approval for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater to the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nA breakdown of the net reductions are as follows: NDDC, by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; and UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion.\n\nOthers are Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe chamber also approved a fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion.\n\nIn his presentation, Adeola said that the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\nLawmakers, who made contributions on the report for the review of the 2022 fiscal framework, attributed the Nigeria\u2019s economic downturn to crude oil theft.\n\nSen. Olubunmi Adetunmbi (APC \u2013 Ekiti), said the federal government and security agencies owed it a duty to stop the stealing of our common wealth.\n\nHe decried that at a time when most countries of the world were reaping hugely from the increase in crude oil prices caused by the Russia-Ukrainian crisis, Nigeria was left out for its inability to meet its OPEC quota.\n\nThe Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, said the country should be in a state of mourning over its current experience, attributing the failure of security agencies to protect oil assets as a major reason for the decline of the economy.\n\nHe expressed concern over rising cases of oil theft despite huge resources allocated to the military, police and other security agencies.\n\nOther Senators, like Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue ), Betty Apiafi (PDP Rivers), urged the Senate not to hastily approve the President\u2019s request to adjust the 2022 fiscal framework until certain questions were answered.\n\nWhile Suswam raised concerns on the widening gap in budget deficit and the federal government\u2019s decision to resort to funding from the Capital Market, Apiafi, demanded answers from the NNPC and relevant agencies on solutions to curb crude oil theft.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks, called on the Federal Government to take \u201cradical\u201d steps towards stopping the theft of crude oil by economic saboteurs.\n\nHe also called for a stop to the importation of refined petroleum products into the country, so as to cut down on expenditures incurred in the process, as well as to maximize profits from crude oil sales.\n\n\u201cThis (crude theft) is not something to play politics with, and I don\u2019t think the answers are going to be easy to come by.\n\n\u201cRadical decisions would have to be taken, but before we find answers we have to live with this, though we have to be as fast as possible in looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI had a session with the Chief of Defence Staff about a month ago, and my discussions with him were on the oil theft and the efforts of our security agencies to combat this menace.\n\n\u201cAnd like we know, our security agencies are doing their best, but we have people \u2013 our people \u2013 who are sabotaging the oil industry, because oil theft is not perpetrated by somebody else but by people who are citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to continue to support the security agencies in whatever way possible so that they are able to deal with this.\n\n\u201cI also believe that, whether there is oil theft or not, until we stop the importation of refined products to Nigeria, we will never get the best out of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWe should, therefore, work to ensure that we produce our refined products locally, because that is one way of cutting our expenditure on importation.\n\n\u201cI also think that diversification of the economy is key, because we depend so much on this oil and gas industry, the slightest issues that affects it internationally affects us seriously in our country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Buhari under fire for pardoning jailed corrupt ex-Govs, Dariye, Nyame",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has come under fire over what has been described as his unnecessary, politically motivated, ill-advised and hasty decision to grant pardon to two former Governors jailed for corrupt practices.\n\nSenator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Mr Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were convicted for corruption, were recently pardoned on health and age grounds when they still have several years to complete their jail terms.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, wondered how the President has reached a consideration that at their relatively young ages they are too old to be in prison confinement whereas there are thousands of awaiting trial inmates and convicted prisoners who are above 80 in Nigerian prisons whose offences are as simple as theft of chickens from their neighbours.\n\nHURIWA said this discrimination on the basis of political connection will adversely harm the rule of law.\n\nHURIWA recalled that the National Council of State had granted state pardon to Dariye and Nyame of Plateau and Taraba States respectively.\n\nThe rights group recalled that the two former governors were among 159 prisoners pardoned by the Council at a meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are a former military general and minister under the Sani Abacha regime, Tajudeen Olanrewaju, an army lieutenant colonel, Akiyode, who was an aide of former deputy to General Abacha, Oladipo Diya; and all the junior officers jailed over the 1990 abortive Gideon Orkar coup.\n\nHURIWA applauded the release of the military officers most of whom were roped into phantom charges of a coup plot by the then maximum dictator General Sani Abacha.\n\nHURIWA recalled that Mr Nyame, who is 66, governor of Taraba State from 1999 to 2007, was serving a 12-year jail term at the Kuje prison for misappropriation of funds while he was in office. The Supreme Court upheld his conviction in February 2020.\n\nRelatedly, Mr Dariye who later got elected as Senator, who is 64, and governed Plateau between 1999 and 2007, was jailed for stealing N2 billion of public funds during his time as Plateau State governor between 1999 and 2007. The former governor, elected as senator representing Plateau Central in the Senate in 2015, was sentenced in June 2018 but still completed his tenure in jail in June 2019.\n\nHURIWA however condemned the early release of the duo, particularly on the ground of seeking to use their political popularity in their minority northern Christian states of Plateau and Taraba to canvass Electoral advantage for the All Progressives Congress in whose administration since 2015 the only high profile politicians jailed for corruption are the two Christian Northerners.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement signed by the national coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said it was a scandal of monumental proportions that whilst the two Christians and former governors of the northern states of Plateau and Taraba were jailed for corruption, a bulk of other corrupt former Northern Governors who are all Moslems are roaming about freely because the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission skewed it\u2019s prosecutorial activities to target mostly Christians and Southerners because of the domination of Northern Moslems in the hierarchy of the EFCC.\n\nHURIWA said the best way to begin a thoroughly professional anti-graft war is to ensure Federal character in the appointment of directors for the anti-graft body currently dominated by Northern Moslems.\n\nHURIWA said it views the action of early release from jail of these politicians who had barely served 30% of their total jail terms as a confirmation of the well-known notoriety of the Buhari led administration as a harbinger of the most sophisticated forms of corruption but which administration chooses to use the instrumentality of the so-called anti-corruption crusade to whip opposition politicians to the line.\n\n\u201cThere has never really been any crusade against corruption in the real sense of it. What EFCC does mostly is to harass students carrying expensive phones and laptops and to parade them as YAHOOYAHOO. Whereas the real big time CORRUPT politicians who are looting Nigeria dry and mindlessly are allowed to have a field day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now survival of the fittest and the most connected in Nigeria of 2022\u201d.",

          "text": "Precious Chikwendu, a former beauty queen has lambasted those blaming the late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, for not speaking up despite being a victim of domestic violence.\n\nOsinachi\u2019s death was announced last Friday, and her husband, Peter Nwachukwu was alleged to have beaten her to death.\n\nReacting, Chikwendu, the estranged wife of a former aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode said if Osinachi had spoken up, society would have blamed her. She said the gospel singer would have been described as a prostitute or mentally ill woman.\n\nChikwendu, who said she was also a victim of domestic violence, released photos showing her bloodied nose, legs and other parts of her body as evidence.\n\nShe wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve been silently reading so much of the blames people are heaping on Osinachi for not speaking up.\n\n\u201cSweethearts you can\u2019t understand the weight on a victim of domestic violence or how we go through so much compactmentalizing how the world would look at us, close friends waiting to laugh at us, those who would say we warned you, how our family members would humiliate us of putting them to shame if we do leave, how we would be irrelevant in places where we were deemed relevant by the status of marriage or maintaining a home.\n\n\u201cYou all forget that a narcissistic partner is one who feels threatened by the abilities or potential of their partner and I\u2019ve said this to so many women and men I\u2019ve had a chance to speak with after eating enough of this breakfast, that if he or she is intimidated by your personality, achievements, charisma, strength or God-given talent, sweetheart runs for your life.\n\n\u201cEnvy mixed with a slice of hate is violence-prone when it has to do with partners or lovers. If he or she can\u2019t learn to talk over arguments without turning a red eye on you, screaming at you which gradually graduates to punches, the absolute need to intimidate or silence you on every unintended provocation, adrenaline rush when they exert authority or control, RUN.\n\n\u201cThese behaviours are the first Azonto steps of abuse. Dear judges, you would have called her a prostitute or mad like I was called for choosing my sanity and peace. Her husband who she had left would pick another supply, walked free and even contested to be president in the next election.\n\n\u201cEvery abusive partner was exposed to violence at some point in life and would pass this on. We are screaming about Osinachi, she is gone and it hurts to see a victim like me not survive but I totally understand she got to the stage where she resigned her fate to die in torture, she felt there was no other way out.\n\n\u201cI got to that stage but snapped out of it after realizing that when I\u2019m gone my boys would hate me for such a selfish decision without considering them. So many people were aware of my situation but never spoke likewise Osinachi\u2019s case because everyone would still blame her regardless.\n\n\u201cBlaming a victim in constant fear is why most would not speak up as so many are reading these negative contributions. Osinachi would have walked away if she had just a bit of her self-esteem intact, she let go cos (because) she felt worthless.\u201d",

          "title": "Easter: Christians brace up for another \u2018gloomy\u2019 celebration",
          "text": "\u2026Nigeria seized with despair \u2013 Catholic bishops \u2018\u2026 Season for sober reflection, not fanfare\u2019 \u2026Rising insecurity worrisome \u2013 Businessman\n\nAs Christians in Nigeria prepare to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter insecurity, inflation, disruptions in power supply, exchange rate wahala and high cost of transportation, among others, appear to have all conspired to make the celebration another gloomy one, BENJAMIN UMUTEME and PAUL OKAH report.\n\nIn years past, the Easter season was usually evoked a time of celebration for both Christian and non-Christians as they scheduled events for the holiday. However, the situation has continued to change over time with many families unable to share in the Easter joy following myriads of challenges. From insecurity to high cost of living and unreliable power supply among others appear to have conspired to take their joy away.\n\nNigerians bemoan hardship\n\nFor Harrison Ikechukwu, a resident of Jikwoyi,\n\nwhat was supposed to be a period of celebration was being viewed by many with reservation. In a chat with Blueprint Weekend he said, \u201cThe Easter was not pocket friendly.\u201d\n\nIkechukwu, who is a plumber, said, \u201cFor me, this Easter will come and go like any other day. Several of my clients are yet to pay me several weeks after I completed their jobs. The complaint is that they don\u2019t have money. So, you can see why I said the Easter will come and go like any other day.\u201d\n\nFor Mrs Blessing Benjamin, she was is yet to feel that a major celebration like Easter was coming up. According to Blessing, who manages a poultry farm, it seemed as if people would not celebrate Easter this year.\n\n\u201cBy this time last year, many families had made payment for chickens, but it is not so this year, it has been the same story from many of them; \u2018things get as e be\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that her price might be scaring people of, she said: \u201cEverybody in this country knows that the price of goods is not the same as it was last year, so, I cannot sell my birds at a loss,\u201d\n\nInsecurity as a factor\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend, a businessman in Abuja, Mr Peter Chukwu, said though he was interested in travelling home to celebrate Easter the rising cases of insecurity in Nigeria, especially the South-east, had prevented him from travelling to Anambra to celebrate with his family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI like Easter for what it stands for. It is a period to celebrate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The activities for the celebration usually commence from the Palm Sunday, which we marked a few days ago as Catholics.\n\n\u201cStaying in Abuja for years, I usually use this period to travel as a result of too many activities in the village, especially family meetings, weddings and other social activities.\n\n\u201cHowever, the rising cases of insecurity recorded in different parts of the country are matters of concern. Because of the killings and kidnappings going on, I have decided not to travel this time around. My state is affected much as there is always news of killing and other forms of violence being perpetrated by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cAnambra is no longer what it used to be. I don\u2019t want to become a victim by travelling to be kidnapped or killed by those I don\u2019t even know how they get their information.\n\n\u201cMy people have a saying that precaution is not cowardice. I am just taking precaution by deciding not to travel home this time around.\n\n\u201cHowever, since there is no end to Easter celebrations, I hope that the security situation will improve so that I can travel next year.\n\n\u201cAlready, I have made excuses to those at home and even sent money across to those I was supposed to attend their social functions. They all understand. Even God himself understands that we can worship Him and celebrate anywhere we are, we don\u2019t necessarily have to travel home before celebrating Easter. Hopefully, things will return to normal in Nigeria and we will resume celebrating Easter in peace.\u201d\n\nHigh cost of living\n\nAlso speaking, a civil servant, Mrs Rita Asuquo, said the high cost of living has prevented her plans of travelling with her family to celebrate Easter in Cross River state.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur world is changing. Easter and all forms of religious celebration are no longer enjoyed because of rising cost of living. The situation has become so bad that we can no longer afford the things that usually made celebrations of this nature memorable.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people looked forward to celebrating Easter with friends and family members because things were affordable. However, the situation is no longer the same.\n\n\u201cPresently, people are struggling to feed and provide for their families. You can hardly find families inviting friends to come and celebrate with them as a result of the rise in the cost of food items.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything in the market today has doubled in price, when compared to what was obtainable last year and years ago. Which one will I mention or leave out? Is it the price of rice that is now N700 per mudu? Is it beans? Is it chicken or food condiments? Yet, there is no increase in salary. We are still receiving what we were paid years ago as civil servants.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t travel home on Christmas as a result of not being able to afford many things that would have made the celebration memorable. We then expected to travel this Easter to Ugep in Cross River state, but this year has been crazy.\n\n\u201cMy husband is a businessman while I work as a civil servant, but the cost of transportation and food items are just no longer tolerable. Instead of travelling unprepared without four children, we have decided to travel in December.\n\n\u201cHonestly, my prayer is that the government should introduce policies that will checkmate the rising cost of living because the situation is no longer funny.\u201d\n\nEaster for sober reflection\n\nOn his part, a teacher, Mrs Edwina Ogochukwu, said that Easter was not the priority of many people like Christmas and has characteristically decided to celebrate with her family in Abuja.\n\nShe said: \u201cChristmas is a great time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and is usually marked with fanfare. However, the same cannot be said of Easter as it is usually a time for sober reflection on the death and resurrection of Christ and the significance of the resurrection to mankind.\n\n\u201cIt is not a surprise that many people pay more attention to Christmas than Easter. In fact, Easter is usually boring to many people, unlike Christmas, so you may not even notice that there is a celebration, except for the holiday by the federal government and closure of schools for just a week.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the many negative issues going on in this country will take the shine of this year\u2019s celebration. In the past, as a child, we usually looked forward to Easter, especially due to the role we played in church activities. However, as a parent, I no longer consider it of any consequence.\n\n\u201cFor one, the cost of living is just too high that I don\u2019t know where we are headed as a country. Unlike in the past where you would cook and invite neighbours to come and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ with you, it is all man for himself now as even insecurity is not allowing for better celebration.\n\n\u201cThis year particularly started on a bad note. We were greeted by fuel scarcity in January, February and March, which caused a rise in transportation, rising in price of goods and services and other negative trends.\n\n\u201cPeople are just recovering from the aforementioned, including a collapse in the national grid that plunged Nigerians into darkness, so not many people will even pay attention to the celebration of Easter.\n\n\u201cAs it is, many families are struggling to survive and won\u2019t bother about expenses if they can help it. However, it is a political period; so many things will hopefully change for the better.\u201d\n\n\u2018Celebration in dismal atmosphere\u2019\n\nThe Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has said that Nigeria was currently seized with despair occasioned by massacres, inflation and industrial action by university lecturers across the country.\n\nCBCN President, Most Revd Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji, made this known in his 2022 Easter message to the nation, Friday, through the National Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a nation, we are celebrating Easter this year in a rather dismal atmosphere that breathes pessimism and despair. The growing insecurity of life and property in the country is compounded by the rising wave of mindless massacres of innocent citizens from unscrupulous terrorists, causing bereavement, trauma and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cEconomic hardship with soaring inflation continues to sweep across the nation like wildfire and seems to reduce millions of our country men and women to a life of wanton suffering and distress.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is thwarting the academic ambitions of many Nigerian students. In some parts of the country, workers are owed arrears of salary, while retired senior citizens eke out existence without regular pensions.\n\n\u201cMany young people are deeply wounded and degraded by unemployment and poverty, a poverty that breeds crimes and seeks relief in hard drugs.\n\n\u201cThe appalling economic condition is worsened by the present scarcity of fuel, which is as puzzling as it is frustrating. This horrible state of affairs is driving many compatriots to a feeling of cynicism as they gaze at a gloomy future that seems to promise them little or nothing.\u201d\n\nThe CBCN also said the 2023 general elections should not be regarded as a do-or-die affair; calling on politicians to ensure that there was no bloodshed during the polls.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Bishops, \u201cAs we draw closer to another period of general elections, which are often characterised by bloody conflicts, we urge everyone seeking an electoral office to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship and not to see a political contest as a do-or-die affair.\n\n\u201cWe also implore one and all to make a personal commitment to non-violence. This is because violence only breeds violence. The vicious cycle of violence results in utter destruction and is never a solution to any human problem.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, far from fighting and killing one another as a way of settling differences, we should say no more bitterness and killings.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges bedevilling the nation, the Bishops stated that the central message of Easter is that when the pressures of life seem heavy; there is a light at the end of a dark tunnel.\n\n\u201cThis message of hope underscores that even though the forces of evil might seem at times to have an upper hand over the good, on the long run the good will triumph over evil. Accordingly, far from yielding to pessimism and despair, we should face the future with hope and optimism, and always try to persevere to the end in hard and difficult circumstances,\u201d CBCN stated.",
          "summary": "In years past, the Easter season was usually evoked a time of celebration for both Christian and non-Christians as they scheduled events for the holiday.\nSo, you can see why I said the Easter will come and go like any other day.\u201dFor Mrs Blessing Benjamin, she was is yet to feel that a major celebration like Easter was coming up.\nAccording to Blessing, who manages a poultry farm, it seemed as if people would not celebrate Easter this year.\nThe activities for the celebration usually commence from the Palm Sunday, which we marked a few days ago as Catholics.\nEaster and all forms of religious celebration are no longer enjoyed because of rising cost of living.",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Gov Yahaya Bello is APC\u2019s best bet",
          "text": "The Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation says the governor Yahaya Bello possesses all the attributes that can retain the presidency for the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2023.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, added that the well experienced and accomplished leaders of the party would not sacrifice Bello\u2019s winning attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics.\n\nShe said this in a statement she signed and made available to journalists on Friday.\n\nAccording to her, the party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult.\n\nHighlighting the attributes that distinguished Governor Bello as the candidate to beat, the media directorate said aside from Bello\u2019s plethora of obvious achievements in Kogi State, he enjoyed the massive support of Nigerian women and youths, which must not be ignored, considering their numerical strength.\n\nHis uncommon loyalty to the President, his colleagues, and allies, among others, as well as his clean records as regards the issue of betrayal of any form, among others, were some of the attributes listed in his favour.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe stage is almost set for Nigerians to, once again, choose the leaders that will steer the affairs of the nation at all levels for another four years. But before the general elections, the struggle is within the parties, and in that regard, many have put their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race in the ruling All Progressives Congress is populated by known heavyweights in Nigeria\u2019s politics, and in the next few weeks, depending on what the party decides, all aspirants that have had the courage to declare so far and those still preparing to do so, would have to jostle for just one ticket.\n\n\u201cSome groups have even almost concluded that this ticket belongs to a particular zone as a result of some prior unwritten agreement, but those who have the interest of the nation at heart have said, times without number, that there is no zoning in the constitution of the party, and more importantly, that the best must get the job, regardless of his zone, if the wellbeing of the country is the target.\n\n\u201cOn the 2nd of April 2022, His Excellency, Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, formally declared to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 under the platform of the APC. In his signature bold manner, the declaration ceremony at the Eagle Square, Abuja, has been described, even by unrelenting critics as the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis was even more significant because, while others veiled their declaration under other programmes, others, afraid to test their popularity the way of Governor Bello, settled for video recordings of their declaration speeches.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed commendable that despite the fears that there would be an irreversible crack in the APC after the last Convention, the party, under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, proved naysayers wrong and had a rancour-free exercise, which has produced leaders of note to man the different offices in the party.\n\n\u201cThe party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult for incumbents. There are, however, many reasons the choice of Yahaya Bello would make the journey easier for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe party needs a candidate that can connect massively with women and youths, considering their combined numerical strength and that candidate is no other than Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cThe preference of Nigerians, regardless of tribe, religion or party affiliation, for a younger leader is also very clear. Of the pool of aspirants, as the country stands today, even across party lines, Governor Yahaya Bello is the best bet for the younger generation if this dream must be actualized.\n\n\u201cThis consideration has made millions of youths across Nigeria resolve to put their numbers behind the Governor, and this is verifiable with the number of active youths with PVCs currently on the Bello Ambassadors Network, Rescue Nigeria Mission, and Yahaya Bello Network, among many other support groups.\n\n\u201cAgain, the North-Central, where Governor Bello comes from, has not produced a democratically elected president in the history of Nigeria, and so, irrespective of what people are made to believe, they will support their own when it is time to take a stand. The North Central believes strongly that the time for them to occupy the Aso Rock Villa is now. Being the strongest contender from the region places Governor Bello in a vantage position to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is an acclaimed unifier. It is a well known fact that, for the first time in the history of Kogi State, the sharp, bitter division between the three major ethnic groups gave way to unity and harmony under the Governor. He united the tribes, starting from his cabinet, and today, everyone is first a Kogi indigene before being identified with his ethnic group. Nigeria needs a unifier now more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is ever ready to build on the President\u2019s efforts in this regard. How he turned the state from a notorious state, where kidnappers and criminals built empires, to one of the safest in Nigeria today and, conveniently, the safest in the north, is a question that has been on the lips of many Nigerians. Therefore, in terms of the main issues confronting the nation, Governor Yahaya Bello has excelled remarkably in Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe loyalty of Governor Bello to the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari, has often been described by critics as \u201cannoying\u201d, but this is the stuff our aspirant is made of. He is loyal to his friends, colleagues and allies, and more so, to the APC. He has demonstrated this on so many occasions, even in very difficult situations. He has no record of betrayal to his party members and his principles. He is a fair game player.\n\n\u201cThe current well experienced and accomplished party leaders would definitely not sacrifice these laudable attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics. They will rally round Governor Yahaya Bello and retain the presidency with a wide margin come 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "An Israeli security forces member moves in position during clashes with Palestinian protestors at the compound that houses Al-Aqsa Mosque, known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old\n\nIsraeli police clashed with masked, stone-throwing Palestinians near Al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem\n\nTensions simmering with Muslim holy month of Ramadan coinciding with Jewish Passover and Christianity\u2019s Easter\n\nAt least 152 Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli riot police at Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the Palestine Red Crescent said, two weeks into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israeli security forces have been on high alert after a series of deadly Arab street attacks throughout the country over the past two weeks, and confrontations at the sacred Jerusalem site carry the risk of sparking a slide back into wider conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The Al-Aqsa compound, which sits atop the Old City plateau and is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as Temple Mount, is the most sensitive site in the generations-old conflict.In a statement, Israeli police said hundreds of Palestinians hurled firecrackers and stones at officers and toward the nearby Jewish prayer area of the Western Wall in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City after Ramadan morning prayers.\n\nPolice entered the Al-Aqsa compound to \u201cdisperse and push back (the crowd and) enable the rest of the worshippers to leave the place safely\u201d, it said, adding that three officers were injured in the clashes. Palestinian injuries were mainly from rubber bullets, beatings, rubber bullets and stun grenades, according to the Palestine Red Crescent.\n\nPolice detained hundreds of Palestinians, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWe are working to restore calm, on the Temple Mount and across Israel. Alongside that, we are preparing for any scenario and the security forces are ready for any task,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry, referring to the Al-Aqsa violence, said it \u201cholds Israel fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences\u201d.\n\n\u201cImmediate intervention by the international community is needed to stop Israeli aggression against Al-Aqsa mosque and prevent things from going out of control,\u201d said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who governs self-ruled areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",

          "title": "US Report: Nigerian Judicial Officers Demand Bribe for Favourable Rulings",
          "text": "A new report by the United States Department of State has alleged that the judiciary in Nigeria remains susceptible to corruption and is constantly under pressure from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nIn its \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021,\u201d the US stated that although the constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, political leaders influence the judges and lawyers, particularly at the state and local government levels.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe document added that there was a widespread public perception that judges were easily bribed, and litigants could not rely on the courts to render impartial judgments.\n\n\u201cMany citizens encountered long delays and reported receiving requests from judicial officials for bribes to expedite cases or obtain favourable rulings,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt listed understaffing, inefficiency, and corruption as factors preventing the judiciary from functioning adequately.\n\nOther challenges, the US stated, included the absence of continuing education requirements for attorneys coupled with the fact that police officers were often assigned to serve as prosecutors.\n\nIt alleged that judges frequently fail to appear for trials, stressing however that the salaries of court officials are low, and officials often lacked proper equipment and training.\n\n\u201cThe constitution and the annual appropriation acts stipulate that the National Assembly and the judiciary be paid directly from the federation account as statutory transfers before other budgetary expenditures are made to maintain their autonomy and separation of powers.\n\n\u201cFederal and state governments, however, often undermined the judiciary by withholding funding and manipulating appointments,\u201d the US report noted.\n\nOn problems with trial procedures, the US posited that although defendants were presumed innocent and enjoy certain rights, authorities do not always respect these rights, most frequently due to a lack of capacity.\n\n\u201cInsufficient number of judges and courtrooms, together with growing caseloads, often resulted in pre-trial, trial, and appellate delays that could extend a trial for as many as 10 years.\n\n\u201cAlthough accused persons are entitled to counsel of their choice, there were reportedly some cases where defence counsel was absent from required court appearances so regularly that a court might proceed with a routine hearing in the absence of counsel, except for certain offences for which conviction carries the death penalty,\u201d it alleged.\n\nAccording to the document, in some cases, the police would demand additional payment from family members who wanted to attend a trial even as the authorities could hold defendants in prison awaiting trial for periods well beyond the terms allowed by law.\n\nFurthermore, the document alleged that Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as well as the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) were mainly focused on pursuing low and mid-level corruption cases.\n\nThe US stated that although there had been a few indictments of active top level government officials, the cases were being hampered by administrative delays.\n\nThe US document stated: \u201cThe ICPC holds broad authority to prosecute most forms of corruption. The EFCC\u2019s writ extends only to financial and economic crimes.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the ICPC and EFCC\u2019s anti-corruption efforts remained focused on low- and mid-level government officials, although both organisations brought indictments against various active and former high-level government officials.\n\n\u201cMany of the corruption cases, particularly the high-profile ones, remained pending before the courts due to administrative or procedural delays.\u201d\n\nAlthough the law provides criminal penalties for conviction of official corruption, the government, the US report stated, did not consistently implement the law, and government employees, including elected officials, frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.\n\n\u201cMassive, widespread, and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government, including the judiciary and security services.\n\n\u201cThe constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office. There were numerous allegations of government corruption during the year,\u201d it added.\n\nOn the government\u2019s posture towards human rights abuses, the report noted government officials sometimes cooperated and responded to such cases, but generally either dismissed allegations, did not provide substantive response, or did not publicise outcomes of investigations.\n\nThe document added that in the north-east, there had been reports that the military threatened civil society groups and humanitarian organisations after aid provided by the organisations purportedly reached insurgent groups.\n\nEven though the law establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as an independent non-judicial mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights, it noted that the role of the body has been largely advisory as well as for training and advocacy purposes.\n\n\u201cDuring the year, there were no reports of its (NHRC) prior investigations having led to accountability. The law provides for recognition and enforcement of damages awarded to plaintiffs, but it was unclear whether this happened,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOn insurgency in the North-east by the militant terrorist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), it noted that the terrorists continued to conduct numerous attacks on government and civilian targets, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries.\n\nAccording to the US report, this has led to the internal displacement of more than three million persons, and the external displacement of more than an estimated 327,000 Nigerian refugees to neighbouring countries as of the year\u2019s end.\n\nQuoting the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the document noted that more than 24,000 persons were registered as missing in the country, with the majority from the conflict area in the North-east.\n\n\u201cThere were reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. According to Amnesty International, the whereabouts of at least 50 suspected supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group arrested in Rivers State between October and November 2020 remained unknown at year\u2019s end,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stressed that ineffective and non-existent civil registration and identification management systems in areas hosting displaced persons, refugees, and returnees remained a concern.\n\nFor refugees, the report pointed out that even when civil documents were obtained, community members and local officials were sometimes unaware of their legal rights or standing, which could also prevent them from moving freely, obtaining work, or accessing health care.\n\nDuring the year, the US posited that ISIS-WA terrorists demonstrated increased ability to conduct complex attacks against military outposts and formations.\n\n\u201cDuring the year ISIS-WA terrorists took over significant territory formerly held by Boko Haram. ISIS-WA expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of Borno State,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the South-east, it stated that following IPOB\u2019s launch of its military wing, the Eastern Security Network, in December 2020, in the first quarter of the year, local media reported 54 violent attacks on civilians and security forces and 222 deaths, representing a 59 per cent and 344 per cent increase, respectively, compared with the quarter prior to its establishment.\n\nIt stated that while some reports estimated the number of Boko Haram and ISIS-WA abductees at more than 2,000, the total count of the missing was unknown as towns repeatedly changed hands, and many families were still on the run or dispersed in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Following public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had seen the country lose huge earnings as well as hobbled its ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday constituted a 13-member Adhoc Committee to investigate oil theft in Nigeria and its impact on petroleum production and oil revenues.\n\nThe composition of the panel was announced on the floor at plenary. Lawan named Senator Bassey Albert Akpan as Chairman of the Committee.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators Yusuf A. Yusuf, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Kabiru Gaya, Mohammed Adamu Aliero, George Thompson Sekibo and Gabriel Suswam.\n\nThe panel also included Senators Kashim Shettima, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Ali Ndume, Stella Oduah, Sani Musa and Ibrahim Gobir.\n\nThe adhoc committee was given one month to conclude work on investigations and report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Senate approved a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAlso, the Senate approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe president, had in a letter to the legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nHe had disclosed that 138 of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe National Assembly in December, 2021, had approved the sum of N442.7 billion for subsidy in the 2022 budget for the period of January to June this year.\n\nBuhari, however, anchored his fresh request on the fact that petrol subsidy was not duly appropriated for in the national budget beyond June.\n\nAccording to him, the development was as a result of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act which stops all such payments past the given June deadline.\n\nIn another letter dated 12th April, 2022, Buhari had requested the National Assembly to approve an additional N1 trillion to his earlier N2.557 subsidy request to bring the total amount on payments to N4 trillion for the year 2022.\n\nThe approval came with the passage of a bill to amend the 2022 Appropriations Act transmitted to the National Assembly on 10th February, 2022, by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration.\n\nThe Senate in December, 2021, had passed a budget of N17,126,873,917,692 trillion.\n\nThe revised sum of N17.3 trillion in contrast with the 2022 budget of N17.13 trillion passed last year, represented a N193 billion increase.\n\nThe passage of the Appropriations Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe figure represented an increase of N192.5 billion from the N17.1 trillion approved and assented to last December.\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriation Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill in both chambers.\n\nThe nation\u2019s parliament increased its annual budget by N12 billion. It was N139 billion in the 2022 budget but has now increased to N153 billion in the revised version, approved yesterday.\n\nA critical analysis of the revised budget showed that there was no increment in the capital vote of N5.415 trillion\n\nThe increment affected only the recurrent expenditure. Out of the total sum of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion passed, N817,699,410,210 billion is for Statutory Transfers; N3,978,087,110,437 trillion for Debt Service; N7,108,621,131,849 trillion for Recurrent (Non-Debt Expenditure); and N5,415,296,438,523 trillion for Contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure.\n\nHe explained that the additional request was against the backdrop of adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework which became imperative due to market developments occasioned by the spike in crude prices, following the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nThe chamber, accordingly, approved the President\u2019s request for additional N3.557 trillion for PMS subsidy with the passage of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, Thursday.\n\nIt also approved N192.52 billion aggregate increase sought by the executive, and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force to enhance their morale.\n\nThe Senate, after passing the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, adjourned till the 26th of April, 2021\n\nThe Senate had before the approval, considered the report of its Committee on Finance on the Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper, laid by the Chairman, Senator Olamilekan Adeola.\n\nThe red chamber, in the MTEF/FSP approved oil benchmark $73 per barrel as proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIt also approved oil production volume of 1.600m per day.\n\nThe chamber gave its nod for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade, Abuja",
