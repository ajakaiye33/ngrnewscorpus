          "text": "Ukraine\u2019s central bank is cracking down on digital money transfers in one of the latest measures implemented in connection with a nationwide declaration of martial law.\n\nKuna, a popular Ukrainian crypto exchange, shows that Ukrainian buyers are paying a premium for Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin, which is pegged to the price of the US dollar.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Ukraine\u2019s central bank is cracking down on digital money transfers in one of the latest measures implemented in connection with a nationwide declaration of martial law.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine ordered electronic money issuers to suspend the issuance of e-money and the replenishment of electronic wallets with e-money. The written order also indicated that the distribution of e-money was temporarily off limits.\n\nThe reference to electronic money likely refers to fiat currencies held in digital accounts through platforms like Venmo or PayPal.\n\nThis is one among many new rules rolled out by the country\u2019s central bank as Russian forces lay siege across Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement, The National Bank of Ukraine made a spate of resolutions, including an order to suspend the foreign exchange market, limit cash withdrawals, and prohibit the issuance of foreign currency from retail bank accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin donations to the Ukrainian army are soaring after Moscow launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine early Thursday.\n\nNew data from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic shows that over a 12-hour window Thursday, nearly $400,000 in bitcoin was donated to Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization providing support to the armed forces.\n\nThe fresh round of crypto donations capitalizes on a trend seen in recent weeks, in which donations totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars have flooded into Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups working to stave off a Russian offensive, according to Elliptic.\n\nActivists have deployed the crypto for a variety of purposes, including equipping the Ukrainian army with military equipment, medical supplies, and drones, as well as funding the development of a facial recognition app designed to identify if someone is a Russian mercenary or spy.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the tacit approval of governments,\u201d said Tom Robinson, chief scientist of Elliptic, which sells blockchain analytics tools to banks and cryptocurrency platforms.\n\nVolunteer groups have long augmented the work of Ukraine\u2019s military by offering additional resources and manpower. When pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014, for example, volunteers stepped up to support protesters.\n\nVolunteer groups and NGOs have collectively raised over $1m in cryptocurrency, according to Elliptic, though that number appears to be quickly moving higher as donations come in amid Russia\u2019s newly launched offensive.\n\nPrior to the Russian attack, Ukraine had plans to open the cryptocurrency market to businesses and investors, according to the Kyiv Post. Top state officials have also been touting their crypto street cred to investors and venture capital funds in Silicon Valley \u2014 but the Russian invasion has pulled focus from these efforts.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has urged young people in the state to embrace technical education and skills acquisition to complement their university education for a sustainable socio-economic wellbeing.\n\nGovernor Ortom gave the charge while declaring open The Symposium on the History of Benue State at 46 organised by the office of his Senior Special Assistant on Archives, Research and Documentation, in partnership with Ideas Tent Communications Limited, held at BENCEDI Makurdi, the Benue State capital on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Governor, who was represented at the event by his Chief of Staff, Dr Gabriel Tivlumun Nyitse, university certificate is no longer enough to live in a fast-changing world, with fewer places in government offices to employ graduates, hence acquiring relevant skills has become necessary for the development of individual and state. He reiterated that his government will continue to train youths in the areas of entrepreneurship, skills acquisition and loans support to enable them start up their own businesses.\n\nOrtom commended the organisers of the symposium, saying, it is very important in helping the younger generation appreciate the history of the state, its people and development.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Commissioner for Education, Dr. Sarwuan Tarnongo, who was represented by Mr. Aniho Titus Terkimbi, encouraged the young people to bev aspire to know their history.\n\nEarlier in his welcome speech, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Benue State on Archives, Research and Documentation, Iorliam Shija, said the objective of the symposium was to raise the historical consciousness of Benue youth.\n\nShija thanked Governor Ortom for permitting and supporting the organisers of the symposium and its ultimate success.\n\nSimilarly, he thanked the management of the various secondary schools that released their students for the symposium, the symposium guest lecturers, teachers and students of the Benue State University Makurdi and Joseph Sarwuan Tarka University Makurdi for attending the event.\n\nDr. Sylvester Ugbegili of History Department, Benue State University Makurdi, who presented a paper titled history of the creation and development of Benue State since 1976, took the young people through memory lane, noting that leaders of the state both past and present have done their best in ensuring its development. He was optimistic that the young people will develop to become patriotic to the state and country, while getting positively involved in politics and development.\n\nAnother paper presenter, Dr. Frank Aagen of Political Science Department, Benue State University Makurdi, while delivering his position on the topic, Youth in democracy: Getting involved, noted that for effective participation in democracy, the youth must organise themselves and come to an agreement of what they want.\n\nAccording to him, youth have the capacity to lead but certain limitations, including constitutional and cultural provisions are standing in their way in the leadership recruitment process. He therefore urged the young people to get involved in advocacy and subject themselves to leadership training to take over as leaders of tomorrow.\n\nSpeaking on their experiences after the symposium, Iember Valentina of the Queen\u2019s of the Rosary Secondary School Gboko, Aloku Endurance of Government Science and Technical College Gbajimba, Hir Gloria Ngufan of Divine Love Catholic Girls Secondary School Katsina-Ala and Mishi Jude of Government Model School, Makurdi, said they were delighted attending the symposium for they all learnt new things.\n\nWhile commending the organisers for putting together the symposium, they appealed for its continuity.",

This will lead to a transparent, free and fair electoral process in this country. That is the beginning of good things to happen in our country. So I commend him for the assent.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ortom said the President also did well by rejecting Section 84(12) of the amended Electoral Act, saying the action is democratic and should be commended.\n\n\u201cThe President did well by indicating that Section 84(12) should be deleted or amended to ensure that we do not cause unnecessary hardship to those in government who want to participate in the electoral process of our country. That is a welcome development because the President did not arbitrarily delete or reject it but decided to send it back to the National Assembly for action.\n\n\u201cThe action is democratic and is left to the National Assembly to see what can be done in that regard. I am sure our representatives will look at it in consultation with us and if they feel it should be deleted, that will be done. So it\u2019s a welcome development,\u201d the Governor stated.\n\nOn the electronic transmission of results, Governor Ortom said \u201cit shows that we have said bye-bye to rigging because it has been a very big challenge where you campaign rigorously and win election and then somebody sits somewhere and writes figures that are not real. But with the electronic transmission to Abuja, it will go a long way in curtailing changing of results and by so doing we will have true representatives and things will work out well for our country Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile advising the President to always listen to the voice of reason from Nigerians, Governor Ortom said when the President does something that is commendable, he will say it openly but will not hesitate to criticize constructively when things are not going on correctly.\n\nHear him: \u201cWhen the President does something that is good, I will commend him but that does not mean I will hesitate in criticising constructively when things are not going on correctly. And I advise Mr President to always listen to the voice of reason from the people just as he has done on the issue of assent to the amended Electoral Act for things to work well in the country,\u201d the Governor pointed.\n\nGovernor Ortom,who was in Mbatiav for a reception in honour of Chief Sabastine Hon, SAN and conferment of the title of Zege Igbya U Mbatiav, described the celebrant as an asset to the country and wished him prosperity in all he does.\n\nThe Governor promised to look into requests by the people of Mbatiav including completion of electricity project at Pika among others.\n\nIn separate goodwill messages, House of Representatives Member for Gboko-Tarka, Rt Hon John Dyegh, Chief Edward Ashiekaa, SAN, Rev Father Tagesa Akpagher, Justice Cosmos Idye among others, described Chief Hon as a blessing to the country who has risen to the peak of his profession.\n\nThe celebrant, Chief Sabastine Hon said he was delighted for the honour of his maternal kinsmen, saying it will spur him to do more for his people and humanity in general.",

Since the coming of this administration, we have not witnessed such queues. So what is responsible? The NNPC should explain,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Biola Akande, a taxi driver, said he got to the fuel station as early as 5 a.m., but met a long queue, adding that such development would not augur well for the country and the economy.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency provide lasting solution that would end the long queue.\n\nOn Feb.16, Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr Mele Kyari, promised that the scarcity would end by the end of February.\n\nHe made the promise before the House of Representatives Committee on NNPC (Downstream), investigating circumstances surrounding the importation of adulterated fuel into the country.\n\nIn Kaduna, the story is the same, as long queues at filling stations persisted on Saturday, after the perceived increase in petrol supply suffered a lapse.\n\nThere had been an epileptic supply of petrol from Monday through Thursday to most filling stations across the state, which stalled from Friday.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has informed the public that it has begun the supply of fuel to easy transportation for travellers, and business owners.\n\nSome of the stations however complained that they only got supplied once.\n\n\u201cIt took a long time for us to get fuel from them. As they supplied the first tank of fuel on Monday, we expected them to repeat same on Wednesday, but till this moment, we have not heard from them,\u201d a filling station manager said.\n\nSome car owners said they spent five to six hours waiting for fuel, but, all their efforts were in vain, as most of them parked their cars and left.\n\nAccording to him, some impatient car owners resorted to buying from black marketers at exorbitant prices.\n\nAlthough some commuters pleaded with the Federal Government to ease the cost of transportation, they vowed that it\u2019s better for them to stay at home, than to spend their life savings on transportation.",

          "title": "Constitution Review: Senators, Reps push stronger law to override president\u2019s veto",
          "text": "By Sanni Onogu and Tony Akowe, Abuja\n\nBill to mandate budget presentation three months to year end\n\nLaw to end parade of suspects before trial by security agencies\n\nWorried about past experiences where Appropriation Bills were rejected by the President after passage by the National Assembly, Senators and members of the House of Representatives have proposed measures that will strengthen existing constitutional provisions on overriding Presidential veto on bills.\n\nThe lawmakers have also proposed an amendment to the constitution to compel the President and governors to present annual Appropriation Bills to the National and State Houses of Assembly at least three months before the end of the year.\n\nThe National and State Houses of Assembly are duty bound by the new amendments being sought to the Constitution to pass the Appropriation Bills before the 31st of December every year.\n\nThese and several other amendments to the Constitution are contained in the recommendations of both the Senate and House of Representatives Adhoc Committees on Constitution Review, chaired by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege and Deputy Speaker, Rep. Ahmed Idris Wase, respectively.\n\nThe lawmakers are expected to vote on the 67 and 68 different recommendations in the Senate and House of Representatives respectively, between Tuesday, March 1 and Wednesday March 2, 2022 and each of the recommendations are expected to be approved by two-thirds majority of elected members of parliament.\n\nBill number 14 which provides procedures for overriding Executive Veto in respect of Money Bills introduced new measures which will make it easier for lawmakers to override the President by altering the provisions of Section 59 (4A) and Section 100 (4A) as it relates to states.\n\nSection 59(4A) of the Constitution reads: \u201cWhere the President, within thirty days after the presentation of the bill to him, fails to signify his assent or where he withholds assent, then the bill shall again be presented to the National Assembly sitting at a joint meeting, and if passed by two-thirds majority of members of both Houses at such joint meeting, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\n\nThe new amendment to section 59 (4) of the Constitution reads: \u201cWhere the President, at the expiration of thirty days after the presentation of a Bill to him, fails to signify his assent or where he withholds his assent, then \u2013 (a) the President of the Senate shall, within seven days, convene a joint sitting of the National Assembly to reconsider the Bill; and (b) if approved by two-thirds majority of members of both Houses at such joint sitting, the Bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required or his veto shall be deemed overridden by the National Assembly\u201d.\n\nHitherto, the President has had course to reject the Appropriation Bill as passed by the National Assembly as a result of what they had often described as budget padding.\n\nBill number 44 which sets the timeline for the Presentation of Appropriation Bills amended the provisions of Section 81 (1) and 121 (in case of states) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which says that \u201cthe President shall cause to be prepared and laid before each House of the National Assembly at any time in each financial year, estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Federation for the next following financial year.\u201d\n\nHowever, the amendment is seeking to strengthen the provision by including specific time limit for the President and governors to prepare and lay their budgets before the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nThe new subsection 1 will now read: \u201cThe President shall cause to be prepared and laid before each House of the National Assembly, not later than ninety days before 31st of December of every year, estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Federation for the next financial year.\u201d\n\nThe law also introduced a new subsection 1(a) which makes it mandatory for the National and State Houses of Assembly to pass the annual budget before the end of end of the year, saying \u201cthe National Assembly shall pass the Appropriation Bill before the 31st of December of every year for the next financial year.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the long drawn agitation to have a minister appointed from the FCT is captured by bill no 61 which seeks to alter the provisions of section 147 of the Constitution which deals with the appointment of ministers from each state of the Federation.\n\nThe FCT has never had a minister appointed from the territory who is an indigene, while the 36 states have always benefited from such appointments.\n\nSection 147(3) states that, \u201cAny appointment under subsection (2) of this section by the President shall be in conformity with the provisions of section 14(3) of this Constitution:- Provided that in giving effect to the provisions aforesaid the President shall appoint at least one minister from each state, who shall be an indigene of such state.\u201d\n\nWhen approved and signed into law, the new provision will now read: \u201cProvided that in giving effect to the provisions aforesaid the President shall appoint at least one minister from each state and the Federal Capital Territory, who shall be an indigene of such state and in the case of the Federal Capital Territory, who shall be a resident and a registered voter in the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nThis provision was rejected by the House of Representatives in the 8th Assembly as it failed to muster the required two-thirds majority to sail through.\n\nBesides, Bill number 60 seeks to amend the provisions of section 299 (a), 301, 302 and 303 of the Constitution to establish the Office of the Mayor for the FCT and transfer the executive powers hitherto conferred on the President over the FCT to the Mayor.\n\nSection 299 (a) of the Constitution states that, \u201cThe provisions of this Constitution shall apply to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja as if it were one of the States of the Federation; and accordingly \u2013 (a) all the legislative powers, the executive powers and the judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the President of the Federation and in the courts which by virtue of the foregoing provisions are courts established for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja;\n\nIt created a new 299 (a) which states that \u201c(a) all the legislative powers, the executive powers and the judicial powers vested in the House of Assembly, the Governor of a State and in the courts of a State shall, respectively, vest in the National Assembly, the Mayor and in the courts which by virtue of the forgoing provisions are courts established for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja;\u201d\n\nIt also altered the provisions of section 301 to make provisions for other offices within the Terriroty that shall be saddled with the responsibilities of the day to day running of the Terriroty.\n\nIt also seeks to delete the provisions of section 302 which states that \u201cthe President may, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by section 147 of this Constitution, appoint for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, a Minister who shall exercise such powers and perform such functions as may be delegated to him by the President, from time to time\u201d, since the functions obtained therein will now be performed by the Mayor.\n\nIt created a new section 303 (A-K) which sets out the procedures for the election of the Mayor of the FCT, required qualifications and tenure of office.\n\nThe new section 303A states that, \u201cthere shall be for the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja a Mayor who shall be the Chief Executive of the Federal Capital Territory Administration.\n\nTo qualify to be elected as Mayor, the law states in the new section 303 (B) that the \u201cperson shall be qualified for election to the office of the Mayor if \u2013 (i) he is a citizen of Nigeria by birth; he has attained the age of thirty-five years; and (iii) he is a member of a political party and is sponsored by that party or is an independent candidate, presents himself as such and complied with the requirement for an independent candidate as prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.\n\nThe candidate must also have been educated up to at least School Certificate level or its equivalent.\n\nThe lawmakers in Bill number 64 also seek to alter the provision of section 34 of the constitution which deals with the dignity of the human person by defining what constitute torture, inhuman and degrading treatment.\n\nThe bill creates a new subsection which ban security agencies from parading persons arrested for any form of crime until they are charged to court.\n\nSection 34 (1) of the Constitution states that, \u201cEvery individual is entitled to respect for the dignity of his person, and accordingly \u2013 (a) no person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment; (b) no person shall he held in slavery or servitude; and (c) no person shall be required to perform forced of compulsory labour.\u201d\n\nThe new amendment states that, \u201cFor the purpose of subsection (1) (a) of this section, \u201ctorture, inhuman or degrading treatment\u201d includes parading persons arrested by the police or any other law enforcement agency in the public.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Bill number 38 seeks to put an end to issues of indigeneship in the court by setting conditions for citizenship of the country and of any particular state in the country.\n\nThe Bill seeks to amend section 31 of the Constitution which states that, \u201cfor the purposes of this Chapter, a parent or grandparent of a person shall be deemed to be a citizen of Nigeria if at the time of the birth of that person such parent or grandparent would have possessed that status by birth if he had been alive on the date of independence; and in this section, \u201cthe date of independence\u201d has the meaning assigned to it in section 25 (2) of this Constitution.\n\nThe bill created new subsections \u201c(2) \u2013 (5)\u201d which set the conditions to be met to become a citizen.\n\nThe subsection states that \u201ca citizen of Nigeria is an indigene of a State if he \u2013 (a) was born in that State; (b) has lived in that State for a continuous period for at least ten years; (c) can show evidence of residency in a Local Government Area of that State for a continuous period for at least ten years; or (d) has evidence of tax payment returns issued in that State for at least ten years.\u201d\n\nSubsection 3 states that, \u201cA person under subsection (2) of this section is entitled to apply to the Local Government Chairman for a certificate of indigeneship of a State.\u201d\n\nAlso, Subsection 4 states that, \u201cA woman who is married to an indigene of a State different from her State of origin for at least five years becomes an indigene of that State and is entitled to all rights and privileges of an indigene of that State in cases of employment, appointment or election into any political or public office.\u201d\n\nIn taking cognizance of discriminatory practices that may work against the woman, the Bill provides some protection for the women in subsection 5 that, \u201cIn the case of divorce or death of a spouse, a woman remains an indigene if (a) there were children born of the marriage or not; or (b) she elects to remain an indigene of that State\u201d.\n\nThe bill will also alter the provision of section 318.",

          "text": "* INEC holds emergency meeting today on implementation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday signed into law the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly on January 31, 2022, with a call on the legislative arm to amend Section 84 (12) of the Act which bars political office holders from participating in their parties\u2019 primaries.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was jolted into action by the signing and summoned an extraordinary meeting of the Commission for today in Abuja, to discuss how to swiftly implement the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nSpeaking shortly before signing the document at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja, witnessed by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; among other top government officials, President Buhari said the amended Electoral Act \u201cholds a lot of promise\u201d for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\nHe, however, stressed the need to amend section 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cFrom the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11), among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at conventions or congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election.\u2019\u2019\n\nQuoting section 84(12), \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election,\u201d the President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe practical application of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension, as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84 (12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84 (12) accordingly.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for its commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionise elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly had on January 25, passed the harmonised version of the Bill.\n\nBuhari had withheld his assent to the earlier version of the Bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nBut the president gave some conditions to give his assent \u2013 an action that prompted the lawmakers to re-work the Bill.\n\nLawan: We Will Consider Buhari\u2019s Request to Amend Section 84 (12)\n\nThe President of the Senate, Lawan yesterday gave an assurance that the legislative arm will look into President Buhari\u2019s request for the amendment of the clause in the Electoral Act which bars political appointees from participating in their parties\u2019 primaries.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen at the State House, Abuja after the signing of the Electoral Bill into law, Lawan said the National Assembly would be willing to consider President Buhari\u2019s request as soon as a Bill to that effect was brought before them.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why we commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the Section, especially clause 84 (12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the Bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what he is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence, INEC is waiting; and because we don\u2019t want to spill over some of these dates, unnecessarily. We will be expecting a communication from Mr. President with respect to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for amendment, but on the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President said with the Electoral Act in place, INEC should hit the ground running and ensure that successful elections are conducted in Osun and Ekiti states this year and the general elections nationwide in 2023.\n\nAtiku, Saraki Hail Signing of New Electoral Law\n\nFormer vice president and the presidential candidate of the PDP in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar has commended the signing of the Electoral Act into law by President Buhari.\n\nIn his verified twitter handle, the former vice president said: \u201cNow that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Electoral Bill, INEC needs to roll-out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023.\u201d\n\nOn his part, former President of the Senate, Abubakar Bukola Saraki commended Buhari for finally signing the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2022, while also hailing the National Assembly, Civil Society Organisations and other Nigerians who remained persistent in insisting that Nigeria deserves a new law that will guarantee free, fair and peaceful poll in 2023 and beyond.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, noted that while President Buhari deserves commendation for working with the federal legislature and rising above partisan interest to give the country a new law that could reform the electoral process, the big applause should go to the members of the civil society organisations who for the past one year have kept up the pressure and continuously agitated for the passage of the new Electoral Act.\n\nINEC Holds Emergency Meeting\n\nMeanwhile, INEC will hold a meeting today over the implementation of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn a statement by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, INEC said the signing of the bill was historic.\n\n\u201cIt contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.\u201d\n\nINEC said given the tight timelines contained in the new law, it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest.\n\n\u201cConsequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for Saturday 26th February 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Offers N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at I&E window for third party use\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday released guidelines for the implementation of the RT200 (Race to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation) Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme with immediate effect.\n\nThe scheme is in furtherance of the apex bank\u2019s effort to reduce exposure to volatile sources of foreign exchange and to earn more stable inflows.\n\nUnder the new framework, the CBN is offering N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window to Authorised Dealers and Banks (ADBs) for other third party use and $35 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window for own use on eligible transactions only.\n\nThe bank added that payment of incentive shall be made on quarterly basis.\n\nIt said the accounts of exporters that qualify for rebates shall be credited latest one week after the end of the quarter.\n\nThis was contained in the CBN circular titled, Operating Guidelines for RT200 Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme, signed by Director, Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. O.S. Nnaji, and directed to all ADBs and the public.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had earlier this month announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports segment and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three and five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme)\u201d, which takes immediate effect, consisted of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nThe rebate scheme is designed to incentivise exporters in the non-oil export sector to encourage repatriation and sale of export proceeds into the FX market.\n\nIt is born out of the need to develop new strategies aimed at earning more stable and sustainable inflows of FX in order to insulate the Nigerian economy from shocks and FX shortages.\n\nThe rebate is further limited to only exporters of finished and semi-finished goods wholly or partly processed or manufactured in Nigeria, except otherwise stated by the CBN, the circular added.\n\nEmefiele had, at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal, as well as biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy of FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow, namely proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe that the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor example, we have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Pull back now, Nigeria tells Russia\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nRussian forces yesterday entered Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, as they continue their push to overrun the whole country and topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government.\n\nThis is coming just 48 hours after the invasion of the country by the Russian army on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlso yesterday during a televised address, Putin urged the Ukrainian military to seize power from Zelenskyy, saying \u201cit will be easier for us to make a deal with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, the federal government met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, and called on Russia to pull back its troops from Ukraine.\n\nReports yesterday afternoon indicated that the Russian forces entered the Obolon district in the north of the city, just a few miles from the centre of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian President had said he was the target of the Russian invasion, vowing not to abandon his country.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Russian forces in Kyiv massed around the northern district of Obolon.\n\nVideos online show armoured vehicles rolling down almost empty roads in the district. There are also videos appearing to show fighting between civilians and people in military uniform.\n\nKyiv has also reportedly being attacked from the air, with residents taking shelter in underground railway stations.\n\nCity officials are said to have told citizens in the Obolon district to stay at home to avoid \u201cactive military operations\u201d.\n\nEarlier in a Twitter post, Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence had appealed to the district\u2019s residents to \u201cinform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails (firebombs) and neutralise the enemy\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian forces reportedly pushed the Russian forces back, having blown up the city bridge to stop their advancement.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that Moscow was ready for talks \u201cas soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to our call and lay down their arms\u201d.\n\nThe Russian government had also said Putin was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, capital of Belarus, for negotiations with representatives of Ukraine.\n\nThe development comes after the Russian leader held a phone call with President Xi Jinping of China.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, said Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, told the Russian leader he would \u201ccreate the conditions\u201d for such a summit.\n\nPeskov said Russia did not intend to occupy Ukraine, saying their aims were clear \u2013\u201cdemilitarisation and de-Nazification\u201d.\n\nPeskov added that the decision to open talks with Ukraine was in response to the request of President Zelenskyy.\n\n\u201cFollowing Zelensky\u2019s proposal to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine, Putin can send representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and his administration for negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,\u201d the readout said.\n\nThe readout added that Minsk was chosen as the venue for the proposed talk.\n\nUkraine Arms Residents with Machine Guns\n\nAs pressure to capture Kyiv heightens, the Ukrainian government has armed volunteers at Kyiv with 18,000 machine guns and tasked them to defend the capital city.\n\nAuthorities have called on the population to resist the invading troops by all means.\n\nThe Interior Ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, stated that 18,000 machine guns \u201chave been handed out in Kyiv to all volunteers, all those who want to defend our capital with weapons in their arms.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry had earlier posted a leaflet containing step-by-step instructions of how to make petrol bombs on its social media.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence and the Interior Ministry had sent an appeal to residents of Kyiv to inform the authorities of the movements of the invading troops.\n\nPutin Tells Ukrainian Military to Seize Power\n\nPutin has called on the Ukrainian military to seize power in their country.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a televised address, Putin told the Ukrainian military it would be \u201ceasier for us to make a deal with you\u201d than with \u201cthis gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis\u201d.\n\nHe accused the Ukrainian leadership of using civilians as \u201chuman shields\u201d.\n\n\u201cI once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis to use your children, wives, and elders as human shields,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTake power into your own hands. It will be easier for us to reach an agreement.\u201d\n\nUN Condemns Arrests of Anti-war Protesters in Russia\n\nThe United Nations yesterday condemned numerous \u201carbitrary arrests\u201d of people in Russia for protesting the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and urged their immediate release.\n\n\u201cArresting individuals for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or a peaceful assembly constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of liberty,\u201d UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.\n\nShe said the agency understood that \u201cmore than 1,800 protesters were reportedly arrested. It is unclear whether some have now been released.\u201d\n\nHer comment came a day after Putin defied Western warnings to unleash a full-scale ground invasion and air assault on Ukraine that quickly claimed dozens of lives and displaced at least 100,000 people.\n\nProtesters turned out in cities around the world, including in Russia.\n\nAn independent monitor said police had detained protesters in 51 cities across Russia, cracking down on dissent after authorities warned citizens against marching.\n\n\u201cWe call on the authorities to ensure the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained for exercising these rights,\u201d Shamdasani said.\n\nUN rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned Thursday that the Russian invasion \u201cclearly violates international law and puts at risk countless civilian lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must immediately be halted,\u201d she said.\n\nBachelet said her office would continue to closely monitor the situation and warned that \u201can information war is also underway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is particularly crucial at this time that we continue to closely monitor and attempt to verify reports of human rights violations, including civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects, including critical infrastructure, and other impact on human rights on the ground,\u201d said Bachelet.\n\nPull Back from Ukraine Now, Nigeria Tells Russia\n\nThe federal government yesterday met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, expressing worries over the Russian-Ukraine conflict with a call for peace to resolve the conflict.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, met with the envoys yesterday in Abuja, saying that the Nigerian government called for peace and the use of diplomacy in resolving all differences.\n\nOnyeama said Nigeria does not condone the approach of aggression by Russia, calling on Russia to pull back.\n\n\u201cPeace and diplomacy to be prioritised by both sides.\n\n\u201cWe support every effort being made to stop the aggression and Russian troops to return to Russia,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the closed-door meeting, German Ambassador to Nigeria, Birgitt Ory, who is also chair of the G7 Group, appreciated the African Union on its statement on the situation.\n\nOry, who also commended Nigeria for putting in its weight, said Nigeria is a very important voice that the world needed to hear.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gone are the days when high crude oil prices meant a lot to Nigeria, or should I say Nigerians. It used to mean a massive boost in our foreign reserves. This enabled the country to meet its foreign trade obligations more comfortably \u2014 without having to ration forex. We could also boost our excess crude account (ECA), where the difference between the budget price for oil and the actual income is saved for the \u201crainy day\u201d. And, of course, there would be plenty to share at the monthly meeting of the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC). Our fortune is so bad today that even if oil sells for $200, there is no guarantee that states would be able to pay salaries. Does it make sense?\n\nIndeed, when was the last time high oil prices really made sense to Nigeria? If we view this in terms of forex reserves, revenues and savings, we have to go all the way back to the eras of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo (1999-2007) and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (2007-2010). In Obasanjo\u2019s eight years, oil averaged $44/barrel \u2014 the lowest average being $17.9 in 1999 and the highest being $72.52 in 2007. Production averaged 2m barrels/day, with a height of 2.7mbpd sometime in 2005. Obasanjo paid $12 billion to settle foreign debts and still left us with $43.13 billion in external reserves, $9.43 billion of which was in ECA. The exchange rate, which he met at N80/$, stabilised at N125/$.\n\nUnder Yar\u2019Adua, when we also enjoyed relatively high prices with a peak of $147/barrel and hit a rock-bottom of $31/barrel, reserves went as high as $62 billion \u2014 the highest in our history \u2014 while the ECA component surpassed $20 billion. Oil production averaged 2.2mbpd. But exchange rate moved from N125/$ to N146/$ as the CBN tried to manage our reserves in the midst of a major global economic crisis in 2008/09. I remember CBN Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi warning currency speculators they would get their fingers burnt because he was ready to defend the naira. Reserves eventually dropped to $42.38 billion by December 2009 and $32.34 billion by December 2010.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan was in the saddle between 2010 and 2015, with the yearly average oil price of $79.47 in 2010; $111.26 in 2011; $111.63 in 2012; $108.56 in 2013; $98.97 in 2014 and $52.32 in 2015. Oil production averaged 2.5mbpd. By the time he left in 2015, the reserves were down to $30 billion, with ECA having just $2 billion \u2014 despite high oil prices and high production figures. The exchange rate moved from N146/$ to $197. The parallel market was touching N220/$, a significant departure from the steady difference of roughly N5 that had prevailed for years. In the last moments of Jonathan\u2019s presidency, his minister of finance said we borrowed to pay salaries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, as Americans say. Under Buhari, oil has averaged $61 per year so far. He met the average of $52.32 in 2015. It went down to $43.47 in 2016, moved to $54.25 in 2017, up again to $71.34 in 2018, down to $64.30 in 2019, dropped to $41.96 in 2020 (remember COVID-19?), recovered to $70.68 in 2021 and has averaged $86.51 thus far in 2022. For the first time since 2014, oil hit $100 at the commencement of the Russian attacks against Ukraine last week. Given our 2022 budget benchmark of $62, we should be saving about $38 per barrel. We should be smiling to the bank. Our foreign reserves, oil revenue and ECA should be gaining weight. We are in pains instead.\n\nWhy are things this desperate? The shortest answer is that we are not producing enough oil to take advantage of the high prices. Price is high but quantity is low. Since Buhari came to office in 2015, we have consistently been averaging less than 2mbpd. There was even a time we were doing less than 1m barrels/day because of attacks by the Niger Delta Avengers \u2014 at a time prices were also low. That is what Fela the legend would call \u201cdouble wahala for dead body\u201d. Our OPEC quota \u2014 intended to shore up oil prices \u2014 is currently 1.683mbpd but we did 1.46mbpd in January. The budget is based on a production of 1.88mbpd. Simple math: the budget is already in a peculiar mess.\n\nBut, again, that is nothing but a short answer. There are other issues \u2014 some induced under Buhari administration and others before him \u2014 which have combined to lace injury with insult. For one, even the 1.46mbpd we currently produce is not so much to our advantage. According to NNPC\u2019s financial report for August 2021 (its latest), our share of production from June 2020 to July 2021 was a mere 28 per cent of the total 682.55 million barrels. That came to 129,981,717 barrels for the 12 months. By contrast, we used to get about 40 per cent share when production levels were close to one billion barrels in a year, out of which we had for export and domestic allocation. Do the math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow it gets more interesting. Our share of oil production is divided into two: federation export and domestic crude allocation. It is from federation export we are supposed to earn forex and domestic crude allocation is supposed to make fuel available locally through the refineries. Because NNPC has been saddled with the full responsibility of making fuel available at N165 per litre by all means necessary, domestic crude allocation now takes priority over export. Thus, more than half of Nigeria\u2019s share of oil production is allocated to the NNPC for the dead refineries. That leaves us with just about 200,000bpd to export on a \u201cgood\u201d day. It could be less if oil production is disrupted.\n\nIt gets more interesting as NNPC uses the domestic allocation to import petrol under the direct sale direct purchase (DSDP) scheme. DSDP is the sophisticated name for trade by barter: please give me petroleum products worth $1 billion in exchange for crude oil worth $1 billion. We do this through third parties. It\u2019s like exchanging tubers of yams for wraps of pounded yam. The immediate benefit is that DSDP guarantees steady supply of products \u2014 fair enough, since our refineries are not working and will never work, no matter the sweet-coated promises made by every government since 1999. But it has also left too much in the hands of NNPC and abuse is inevitable. I will explain myself later.\n\nBut the story even gets worse. Unable to build our reserves as a result of our low share of production despite high oil prices, we have fallen head over heels for petrol subsidy. It is expected to gulp N3 trillion this year alone. In a country that is spending most of its revenue on debt service, where government is borrowing massively to finance its budget, where many states cannot pay salaries, we spent N210 billion on petrol subsidy in January 2022. Because of this huge bill, NNPC remitted zero revenue from domestic crude to the federation account. All went into subsidy. NNPC had also deducted N270 billion in December 2021 for subsidy. We will buy sense one day.\n\nLet me summarise what we have discussed so far. One, despite high oil prices, we are not smiling because our export is low as a result of low oil production. We cannot even meet our OPEC quota. Two, our share of current production is miserable. Three, NNPC takes the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s share to exchange for petroleum products with foreign refineries via third parties under DSDP. That means we cannot earn substantial forex income from federation export. Four, domestic allocation is used to subsidise petrol. As a result, revenue to federation account cannot grow. NNPC sometimes remits zero kobo, blaming subsidy, pipeline repairs, crude theft and such like. Abuse is inherent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA very critical question in all of this is: why is our daily production so low? Investment in the upstream sector has been falling over the years for various reasons, one of which was the uncertainty around government policy. We dilly-dallied over the petroleum industry bill for so long no rational investor would come and pour billions into a sector they were not sure of the laws they would be operating under. We are now reaping the consequences of this underinvestment. Our policy makers never seem to care about the consequences of their indecision. We toyed with the PIB for too long. We were playing draughts and Candy Crush while investors were waiting for us.\n\nBuhari eventually signed the PIB into law \u2014 and I commend him for this as well as for the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (DOIBPSC) which, combined, should bring about a better operating environment for the oil industry. But he also suspended one of the most critical aspects of PIA \u2014 liberalisation of the downstream sector \u2014 because he wants to cater for our beloved petrol subsidy. The suspension has consequences. If you were an investor, would you not think twice? Nobody invests in a country for God\u2019s sake. We are currently reaping the rewards of our cumulative inaction and indecision. We will pay heavily for this suspension as well. It is not a curse.\n\nFinally, why is Nigeria\u2019s share of oil production this low? The joint ventures (JVs) with the oil majors, in which we have 55 per cent, used to give us the biggest share \u2014 from which we exported and earned cool billions of dollars. But the oil companies have restrategised. They are moving offshore, utilising the more fiscally rewarding production sharing contracts (PSCs). Until now, PSCs did not yield much royalty. Most production attracted zero royalty owing to the thresholds. The law has now been amended. The \u201cprofit oil\u201d, which is Nigeria\u2019s share from PSCs, is usually small in the scheme of things. The contractor takes most of the profit, having brought both the finance and the expertise.\n\nLest I forget, there is also the little matter of crude oil theft. From what I am hearing, we may be experiencing the highest level of theft in history. The perverse joint venture between the security agencies and the politicians, operated by militants, is even more profitable now that crude oil prices are high. The international oil companies are comfortable moving further offshore because they are safer and more secure there and lose virtually no barrel of crude. In summary, we can easily explain why we are unable to meet OPEC quota: it is a combination of crude oil theft, poor funding of JVs and the high cost of restarting shut production. The chickens have finally come home to roost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, if you thought Nigeria had problems under Jonathan, we were just warming up. A lot has gone wrong in the areas of policy and politics in the last few years that only a miracle of Lazarus-come-forth proportions can restore Nigeria to the oil fortunes of the Obasanjo-Yar\u2019Adua era. At this rate, we should not expect to return to production levels of 2.5mbpd, or genuine foreign reserves of $60 billion, or ECA flowing with over $20 billion. High oil prices will not put a lasting smile on our faces. The subsidy bill will continue to mount. The three tiers of government will keep having less revenue to share at FAAC as NNPC keeps deducting \u201cunder recovery\u201d. We are on a long, rough journey.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nEL-DORADO SIGNED\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all the back-and-forth, President Muhammadu Buhari has finally signed the amended electoral law. According to commentators, analysts and activists, failing to sign the bill was going to put our democracy in danger. It was a plot to rig the 2023 elections, they said. The PDP even said it could lead to violence. The amendment is now law. What a relief. Our democracy is no longer in danger. Rigging has become history. There will be no more vote-buying. Security agencies will no longer influence the outcome of the elections. Electoral violence is dead and buried. I am so glad to be part of this momentous event in our history. But don\u2019t we just love hyperboles in this country? Drama.\n\nJABBING HIJAB\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI need somebody to help me understand this: how does wearing hijab to school disturb anybody\u2019s life? This is an honest question \u2014 because I think maybe I am just being na\u00efve. I see Christian students wearing Deeper Life and Redeemed scarves in schools. They don\u2019t wear earrings. I see Muslim students in advanced societies wearing hijab. All these things never disturb my peace. The recent crisis in Kwara state, where a life was lost in the protest against hijab, is yet another indication that those fanning the embers of avoidable conflicts in our society are still very much active. To my Christian brethren, I ask: what would Jesus do to a student wearing hijab? Think.\n\nPAIN IN UKRAINE\n\nRussia\u2019s blitzkrieg on Ukraine has shown, once again, that the UN is not that powerful. The Big Boys have proved that they can always do whatever wherever whenever. In 2003, the US and its allies bypassed the UN and invaded Iraq in search of chemical and biological weapons that never materialised. Meanwhile, I was disappointed at the ease with which Russia started brutalising Ukraine on Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s Western allies knew Russia was going to attack. They kept talking tough. They promised Ukraine full support. When Russia said its troops had withdrawn, they said it was a lie. But all Russia got after the invasion were sanctions and more sanctions. Underwhelming.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nAlhaji Isa Bayero, cousin of the Emir of Kano, has asked the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the aviation regulator, to punish Air Peace for \u201cdisrespect\u201d. Why? The airline refused to delay its take-off for the emir who was late for a Lagos-Kano flight. I know that there are a few details that may be missing. One, the emir\u2019s lateness was caused by Air Peace\u2019s delayed departure from Banjul, Gambia. It was not his fault. Two, I know that Air Peace employees are generally rude. I take it as organisational culture. However, how can you say a flight should be delayed because you are emir? And this becomes the subject of a petition? Nigerian big men actually think they own us. Ridiculous.",

The immediate benefit is that DSDP guarantees steady supply of products \u2014 fair enough, since our refineries are not working and will never work, no matter the sweet-coated promises made by every government since 1999. But it has also left too much in the hands of NNPC and abuse is inevitable. I will explain myself later.\n\nBut the story even gets worse. Unable to build our reserves as a result of our low share of production despite high oil prices, we have fallen head over heels for petrol subsidy. It is expected to gulp N3 trillion this year alone. In a country that is spending most of its revenue on debt service, where government is borrowing massively to finance its budget, where many states cannot pay salaries, we spent N210 billion on petrol subsidy in January 2022. Because of this huge bill, NNPC remitted zero revenue from domestic crude to the federation account. All went into subsidy. NNPC had also deducted N270 billion in December 2021 for subsidy. We will buy sense one day.\n\nLet me summarise what we have discussed so far. One, despite high oil prices, we are not smiling because our export is low as a result of low oil production. We cannot even meet our OPEC quota. Two, our share of current production is miserable. Three, NNPC takes the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s share to exchange for petroleum products with foreign refineries via third parties under DSDP. That means we cannot earn substantial forex income from federation export. Four, domestic allocation is used to subsidise petrol. As a result, revenue to federation account cannot grow. NNPC sometimes remits zero kobo, blaming subsidy, pipeline repairs, crude theft and such like. Abuse is inherent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA very critical question in all of this is: why is our daily production so low? Investment in the upstream sector has been falling over the years for various reasons, one of which was the uncertainty around government policy. We dilly-dallied over the petroleum industry bill for so long no rational investor would come and pour billions into a sector they were not sure of the laws they would be operating under. We are now reaping the consequences of this underinvestment. Our policy makers never seem to care about the consequences of their indecision. We toyed with the PIB for too long. We were playing draughts and Candy Crush while investors were waiting for us.\n\nBuhari eventually signed the PIB into law \u2014 and I commend him for this as well as for the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (DOIBPSC) which, combined, should bring about a better operating environment for the oil industry. But he also suspended one of the most critical aspects of PIA \u2014 liberalisation of the downstream sector \u2014 because he wants to cater for our beloved petrol subsidy. The suspension has consequences. If you were an investor, would you not think twice? Nobody invests in a country for God\u2019s sake. We are currently reaping the rewards of our cumulative inaction and indecision. We will pay heavily for this suspension as well. It is not a curse.\n\nFinally, why is Nigeria\u2019s share of oil production this low? The joint ventures (JVs) with the oil majors, in which we have 55 per cent, used to give us the biggest share \u2014 from which we exported and earned cool billions of dollars. But the oil companies have restrategised. They are moving offshore, utilising the more fiscally rewarding production sharing contracts (PSCs). Until now, PSCs did not yield much royalty. Most production attracted zero royalty owing to the thresholds. The law has now been amended. The \u201cprofit oil\u201d, which is Nigeria\u2019s share from PSCs, is usually small in the scheme of things. The contractor takes most of the profit, having brought both the finance and the expertise.\n\nLest I forget, there is also the little matter of crude oil theft. From what I am hearing, we may be experiencing the highest level of theft in history. The perverse joint venture between the security agencies and the politicians, operated by militants, is even more profitable now that crude oil prices are high. The international oil companies are comfortable moving further offshore because they are safer and more secure there and lose virtually no barrel of crude. In summary, we can easily explain why we are unable to meet OPEC quota: it is a combination of crude oil theft, poor funding of JVs and the high cost of restarting shut production. The chickens have finally come home to roost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, if you thought Nigeria had problems under Jonathan, we were just warming up. A lot has gone wrong in the areas of policy and politics in the last few years that only a miracle of Lazarus-come-forth proportions can restore Nigeria to the oil fortunes of the Obasanjo-Yar\u2019Adua era. At this rate, we should not expect to return to production levels of 2.5mbpd, or genuine foreign reserves of $60 billion, or ECA flowing with over $20 billion. High oil prices will not put a lasting smile on our faces. The subsidy bill will continue to mount. The three tiers of government will keep having less revenue to share at FAAC as NNPC keeps deducting \u201cunder recovery\u201d. We are on a long, rough journey.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nEL-DORADO SIGNED\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all the back-and-forth, President Muhammadu Buhari has finally signed the amended electoral law. According to commentators, analysts and activists, failing to sign the bill was going to put our democracy in danger. It was a plot to rig the 2023 elections, they said. The PDP even said it could lead to violence. The amendment is now law. What a relief. Our democracy is no longer in danger. Rigging has become history. There will be no more vote-buying. Security agencies will no longer influence the outcome of the elections. Electoral violence is dead and buried. I am so glad to be part of this momentous event in our history. But don\u2019t we just love hyperboles in this country? Drama.\n\nJABBING HIJAB\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI need somebody to help me understand this: how does wearing hijab to school disturb anybody\u2019s life? This is an honest question \u2014 because I think maybe I am just being na\u00efve. I see Christian students wearing Deeper Life and Redeemed scarves in schools. They don\u2019t wear earrings. I see Muslim students in advanced societies wearing hijab. All these things never disturb my peace. The recent crisis in Kwara state, where a life was lost in the protest against hijab, is yet another indication that those fanning the embers of avoidable conflicts in our society are still very much active. To my Christian brethren, I ask: what would Jesus do to a student wearing hijab? Think.\n\nPAIN IN UKRAINE\n\nRussia\u2019s blitzkrieg on Ukraine has shown, once again, that the UN is not that powerful. The Big Boys have proved that they can always do whatever wherever whenever. In 2003, the US and its allies bypassed the UN and invaded Iraq in search of chemical and biological weapons that never materialised. Meanwhile, I was disappointed at the ease with which Russia started brutalising Ukraine on Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s Western allies knew Russia was going to attack. They kept talking tough. They promised Ukraine full support. When Russia said its troops had withdrawn, they said it was a lie. But all Russia got after the invasion were sanctions and more sanctions. Underwhelming.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nAlhaji Isa Bayero, cousin of the Emir of Kano, has asked the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the aviation regulator, to punish Air Peace for \u201cdisrespect\u201d. Why? The airline refused to delay its take-off for the emir who was late for a Lagos-Kano flight. I know that there are a few details that may be missing. One, the emir\u2019s lateness was caused by Air Peace\u2019s delayed departure from Banjul, Gambia. It was not his fault. Two, I know that Air Peace employees are generally rude. I take it as organisational culture. However, how can you say a flight should be delayed because you are emir? And this becomes the subject of a petition? Nigerian big men actually think they own us. Ridiculous.",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenyan influencers were paid $10 to $15 to discredit controversial bills on Twitter",
          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the 19 year old Nigerian building his own blockchain empire",
          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace Universe Africa, a technology development company based in Yaba, Lagos, launched its proprietary, needs-driven, multipurpose R & D lab on Tuesday, February 22, 2022.\n\nThrough its R&D lab, Space Universe Africa aims to provide solutions to local and global challenges through innovation and democratise technological knowledge across the industry, reducing inequalities in technological advancements between Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nThe digital revolution has seen the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, Web3, and most recently, the metaverse, among others.\n\nSpace Universe Africa understands the importance of leveraging these technologies to build purpose-driven products based on a unique philosophy called the principle of Ground Truth, which states, \u201cIf you can break down into smaller pieces, identify each component, and couple it back together in a better way, then you can build practically anything, and you\u2019re an innovator.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlamide Habibat, co-founder, Space Universe Africa\n\nThe R&D lab is built on this principle. Also, a significant product of Space Universe Africa known as the School of Ground Truth embodies this principle. Space Universe Africa is solving problems on many fronts, and here are some of their products that are doing just that.\n\nSchool of Ground Truth: Human resource experts agree that tech talents will be hard to find and keep in 2022 and beyond. In Africa, poor access to information and training resources is a major challenge affecting the availability of tech talents needed to take the continent to the next phase of innovation. Through the School of Ground Truth, Space Universe Africa is helping to bridge the talent gap by employing innovative hybrid teaching methods and learning technologies. The School which uses the gamification of learning through AR and VR technologies plans to explore the metaverse and take students on a journey to explore the many possibilities in the virtual world. DevPartners: According to Evans Data Corporation, there are an estimated 26.9 million software developers worldwide; however, according to the international finance corporation (IFC), there are an estimated 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. The data tells a story of the vast talent deficit in Nigeria. DevPartners is solving the tech talent shortage issue in the African tech space by working closely with the School of Ground Truth and other partners in developer communities in upskilling potential tech talent through training, internship, outsourcing, and funding. Communication Arc: This is the company\u2019s digital marketing arm, with a presence in some African countries. They help firms run their communications campaigns, including ads generations and distribution. Communication Arc is associated with two flagship products: RadioAdspread and PopAdlink.\n\nRadioAdspread: RadioAdSpread is a pioneering platform for aggregating global radio stations to ease brand advertisement and aims to solve the challenges faced by SMEs and Radio Stations\n\nRadioAdSpread is a pioneering platform for aggregating global radio stations to ease brand advertisement and aims to solve the challenges faced by SMEs and Radio Stations PopAdlink: PopAdlink is an online platform that provides sophisticated tools advertisers can leverage for traffic and business growth. Both platforms currently serve several customers across the continent.\n\nWith Awamaridi, Space Universe Africa plans to take a bold step into space and chart the unknown to make life better for humans while creating a healthy environment.\n\nAwamaridi is a Yoruba word for \u201cthe unknown,\u201d and the space-focused programme aims to provide sustainable solutions to how energy and data are produced and used without harming the environment.

          "text": "Regional groups, political parties, civil society organisations (CSOs) and eminent Nigerians have implored relevant authorities to ensure that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday is strictly adhered to with a view to promoting fairness and credibility in future elections in the country.\n\nAfter weeks of anticipation and outright suspense, the president eventually appended his assented to the electoral bill.\n\nBut Buhari did not sign the bill into an Act without getting a firm commitment from the National Assembly for an immediate review of section 84 (12) of the law which restricts serving political appointees, including ministers, from seeking elective offices.\n\nThe said section of the Act provides that political appointees seeking elective offices must first of all resign their appointments and that they.\n\nIt stipulates: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking at the council chamber of the presidential villa after appending his assent to the bill, President Buhari who said the latest version of the bill was a great improvement from the earlier version which he refused to sign in November 2021 said in line with established tradition, he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government after careful and thorough reviews of the bill and its implications for the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of the practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly\u201d.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senate President Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, chief of staff to the president, and secretary to government of the federation were present to witness the signing of the bill.\n\nAlthough the president admitted that the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 passed by the National Assembly holds a lot of promise for improving the electoral process in the country, with the introduction of new technology and efforts to engender clarity and transparency, he highlighted the need to amend section 84 (12), which he said contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nThe president noted: \u201cDistinguished Senators and honourable members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potential of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes a fundamental defect, as it conflicts with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn their part, Senate President Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabimila, commended the president for giving Nigerians a law that will improve the nation\u2019s electoral system.\n\nLawan pledged that the parliament would look into the president\u2019s request on section 84 (12), saying the parliament expects an immediate communication on the proposed amendment.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he disagreed with the section, especially clause 84(12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of the essence, INEC is waiting. And because we don\u2019t want to spill over some of these dates unnecessarily we will be expecting communication from Mr President to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for the amendment but.On the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nFor his part, Gbajabimila said the 9th Assembly had delivered major legislations in its three years of existence.\n\n\u201cSo we have over a year left and I believe we will begin to polish off some other pieces of legislation but the major ones, we have dispatched within the interest of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the development, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said they will continue to demand for electoral transparency, even as theycommended President Buhari, the media, National Assembly and other Nigerians for standing on the right path.\n\nThe executive director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said assenting to the electoral bill was a big achievement that should be commended.\n\nRafsanjani who also doubles as the chairman, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), thanked the National Assembly, Media, CSO and Nigerians for the collective success on having a new amendment to the electoral Act.\n\nHe said that under democracy people cannot be suppressed by the few interests groups, noting that CSOs will continue to demand electoral transparency in order to have good governance in Nigeria.\n\nRafsanjani said that President Buhari has fulfilled his obligations by upholding the values of democracy and assenting the electoral bill.\n\nRafsanjani noted that the protest, which CISLAC was part of, became necessary owing to the fact that the President Buhari-led administration has declined assent to the bill twice.\n\nAccording to the CISLAC helmsman, the electoral act will guarantee INEC\u2019s financial independence, which in turn will ensure the electoral umpire gets early funding on time to prepare for election.\n\nIn the same vein, Mr Rafsanjani appealed to Nigerians to comply with the electoral law.\n\nHe also appealed to Civil Society Organisations and the media not to relent in fighting for social justice as only then would we able to achieve the Nigeria of our dreams.\n\nAlso, reacting to the development, regional bodies, political parties and CSOs urged INEC and other relevant authorities to ensure enforcement of the law.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said the signing of the bill into law will help to broaden and deepen democracy in Nigeria.\n\nSpokesman of Ohananeze, Alex Ogbonnia, however insisted that it has put INEC on the alert to prepare for a transparent election in 2023.\n\nOgbonnia stated that with the signing, INEC has enough time to plan for the 2023 election, adding that INEC should not fail the people.\n\nAlso, the apex northern sociocultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) commended President Buhari for signing the bill into law.\n\nIn the same vein, Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) and the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) applauded the president for taking the bold step in signing the Electoral Act.\n\nACF through its national publicity secretary, Mr Emmanuel Yawe said, \u201cIt is a positive sign. The political temperature was unnecessarily heated up because of the delay in signing the bill. We hope this will go down if the demands of those agitating for the bill to become an Act are met. We also hope that this will lead to a smooth general election next year\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), through its spokesperson Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, \u201cThis is a welcomed development, even though a little bit belated. INEC will roll out a comprehensive timeline. There is so much riding on what exactly is amended and how it will contribute to the quality of elections and the processes in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is full of traps and daily people are putting more traps, we will however wait and see the actual content of the amended bill, because when I see what is amended and how it will contribute to the elections in this country, then one can talk more, I hope they will publicise it and I hope people will get opportunity to make an input and above all it is important we emphasis on the orderly and peaceful political electoral and other election activities.\u201d\n\nAYCF through the national president, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said \u201cI commend the president to have done what he did, this is what is expected from him as a statesman, it is one thing to sign the electoral bill and it is another thing for Nigerians to do the right thing. Often time people do the wrong thing not because there are no laws but because they don\u2019t put them into practices and that is why sometimes things happen wrongly. Today I am happy he signed the amended Electoral Act, so nobody will hold him responsible for not signing it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the CNG through its spokesperson AbdulAzeez Suleiman said, \u201cWhat is important is that the president has at last signed the bill after it suffered several rejections. It is now for legal experts and other professionals to x-ray and dissect its practical implications.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, like most Nigerians who have called for electoral reforms, we are optimistic that the law will ease electoral processes and promote fairness and credibility in future elections especially that it also provides for the use of electronic voting and electronic transmission of results\u201d.\n\nOn its part, the Pan Yoruba Social political organization, Afenifere, said the signing of the electoral Bill into law by President Buhari without constitutional amendment and restructuring of the country will not yield the desired results.\n\nAfenifere\u2019s acting leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, who stated this said, \u201cI am not impressed, I am not impressed because to go into any election, without restructuring the country is an exercise in futility.\n\n\u2018\u2019Why conducting the election when the constitution under which you operate is against the election and the people, the constitution is fraudulent, we agreed it is fraudulent, why is he trying to change it, we all knew it is a military constitution, they(military) set aside the constitution Nigeria founding fathers gave to us.\n\n\u201cThe military came with their own constitution and inserted in it, all the things our founding fathers have got rid of on credibility, but we should have told the military to return to the barracks with their constitution, but we failed to do that. That is my view, mind you I have few years to spend with you, but I have to leave my word with you.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) said by signing the electoral bill into law, Buhari has advanced Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, president of the forum, Dr Bitrus Pogu, expressed optimism that Nigerians will experience more transparency in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cOf course, the Middle Belt Forum is so grateful to Mr President. By signing the electoral bill, he has advanced our democracy.\n\n\u201cHe has improved on the quality and transparency and the credibility of our elections. However, we should not stop at this point because it is not just voting electronically and transmitting the election results electronically. The number of accredited voters must be transmitted electronically,\u201d Pogu said.\n\n\u201cSo, the transmission should also include the accredited voters so that if the votes are transmitted, it will conform to the accredited people that took part in the process.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for obliging to the cry of Nigerians by signing this bill into law. So, our position is that it will not just be about transmission of election results electronically, but also transmission of the accredited voters,\u201d Pogu added.\n\nAlso, the umbrella body of political parties in the country, Inter-party Advisory Council (IPAC), described the president\u2019s action as a big achievement for the 2023 general elections.\n\nIPAC said with the signing, Buhari has improved the electoral legal framework for the country.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend yesterday, IPAC chairman, Yabagi Sani, congratulated the president, INEC and Nigerians on the feat.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate the president for doing that. It is a landmark achievement. We now have an electoral bill that we can use for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big achievement. IPAC congratulate the President and Nigerians. We also congratulate INEC because they now have an improved electoral legal framework. So, we are happy,\u201d Sani said\n\nOn the return of the Electoral Act to the National Assembly for more work on section 8, IPAC said it is the prerogative of the president to do that, adding that he must protect the constitution of the country.\n\nOn its part, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) commended President Buhari for signing the electoral bill into law, saying it is a development which provides an improved legal framework in the lead up to 2023 electioneering processes and all coming elections.\n\nA statement by national secretary of the party, Sen John James Akpanudodehe, noted: \u201cThis is a big win for our electioneering processes and our democracy. Since 2015 when the President Buhari-led APC government came into being, our commitment and support for constitutionally-permitted innovations that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy, have not been in doubt. The new Electoral Act is another pointer.\n\n\u201cFrom legal backing given to election management bodies to review election results declared under duress, provisions for people with disabilities and special needs, electronic transmission of election results among other key provisions, current and coming generations will fondly remember President Buhari as the courageous leader who institutionalised credible elections and internal democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe note with appreciation the patriotic efforts of the National Assembly, civil societies, development partners and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians whose collective efforts and support has birthed the new Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe task of improving the credibility of our elections is a collective and continuous one. As a party and government, we will continue to champion needed reforms. We hereby call on well-meaning Nigerians to join us to completely stamp out past practices of electoral fraud weaponised by past administrations of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\nBut the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the newly signed Electoral Act is a death knell for the APC) which thrives in manipulations, ballot box snatching, ballot box stuffing and alteration of election results at the collation centers against the expressed will of the people.\n\nIt congratulated Nigerians, particularly Civil Society Organizations for fighting on the side of the PDP in putting pressure on President Buhari to finally assent to the electoral bill.\n\nThe party also saluted the courage of PDP and other opposition members in the National Assembly for standing their ground on the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill which among other things principally provided for the electronic transmission of election results directly from the polling units.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cThe PDP calls on Nigerians not to rest on their oars but to further strengthen their resolve by rallying themselves to take charge of their polling units and ensure that their votes are transparently counted and transmitted in the 2023 general elections.",

          "text": "Until the airports in Ukraine are opened, Nigerians trapped in the country may not have an easy exit, the federal government has been told by the authorities of Ukraine.\n\nConsequently, the Nigerian government is weighing the option of evacuating the affected citizens by road.\n\nThis was one of the outcomes of the meeting Nigeria had with the two envoys of Russia and Ukraine to Nigeria yesterday.\n\nThe Ambassador of Ukraine Kirdoda Valerii had said that his country\u2019s air space was no longer safe for flying and that the airports had been closed.\n\nNigeria had summoned the Ambassador of Russia Alexei Shebarshin and Valerii following the escalating violence triggered by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who met with the envoys separately behind closed doors, told reporters that during his parley with the Russian envoy, he expressed the displeasure of the Nigerian government over the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a United Nations (UN) member state, and country with which Nigeria has diplomatic relations.\n\nOnyeama also told Shebarshin that Nigeria wants Russia to revert to the status quo before the military action and to prioritise diplomacy and dialogue.\n\n\u201cThis is really the position of the government. And also, that we have 5,600 Nigerians in Ukraine and we are very concerned about what we are hearing and what we are seeing regarding missiles and bombs about the safety of our Nigerian citizens there, that we would like to be able to evacuate them,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Onyeama, the Russian envoy promised to communicate the concern of the Nigerian government to his home country, adding that Russia considers Nigeria a friendly nation and would do nothing to harm her citizens. The envoy assured the minister that their action is targeted at military installations and not against civilian areas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnyeama said he also discussed with the Russian envoy about the practicalities of how Nigeria can get her citizens out of Ukraine, those who want to leave the country and what measures they could apply to facilitate to safeguard Nigerians in Ukraine, adding that hopefully, the war won\u2019t last long.\n\nOn the question about the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine, the minister said the issue can only come up when the airports open.\n\nOnyeama said the Russian envoy stated that they would also see some airports as military targets possibly.\n\nThe minister further discussed road travel as an alternative to facilitate the evacuation of Nigerians even though some Nigerians have been able to flee into the neighouring countries such as Poland.\n\nThe Russian envoy, however, told Onyeama that there might be risk involved, while also saying that Russia was mindful of the civilians from foreign countries and promised to take all the necessary measures to ensure their security.\n\n\u201cHe was a lot more sanguine, optimistic that no harm will come to them, but we cannot take any risks,\u201d Onyeama stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the same vein, Onyeama, after his meeting with the Ukrainian envoy, expressed the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the country over the war imposed on the nation and its people that came under heavy bombardment, which has led to dozens of deaths and injuries and destruction of property.\n\nThe minister pointed out that Ukraine is a country that Nigeria has diplomatic relations, a member of the UN and cannot condone the violation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nHe also told the Ukrainian envoy that Nigeria has over 5,000 students and citizens in the country and was very concerned about their safety and welfare.\n\n\u201cAnd we certainly want the cooperation of the government of Ukraine to do whatever is possible to ensure their safety and security and to also seek advice as to how the evacuation can be facilitated,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nAccording to the minister, the envoy said the Ukrainian government has given all the residents and civilians, specific instructions about how to stay safe and the measures to take.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine will also act as a coordinating mechanism in reaching out to all Nigerians in Ukraine and ensure that they adhere to the advice and directives.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian envoy expressed gratitude to the government and people of Nigeria for their support.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are in a very difficult situation, but we are fighting against the aggression and we believe that we will all win,\u201d the Ukrainian envoy said.\n\nValerii also said Nigerian students in Ukraine were in the same situation as anybody else in his country.\n\n\u201cUkrainian government does not differentiate between people on the basis of their nationality and that is the best effort to protect everybody.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the evacuation of Nigerian students is not possible because it is not safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine. As soon as it is safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine, we will join the Embassy of Nigeria in Ukraine and jointly with the Nigerian government, we will arrange for the evacuation of Nigerian students,\u201d the envoy said.\n\nOn the reports that Nigerians are being conscripted into the Ukrainian army to fight, the envoy noted declared that it was optional.\n\nThe federal government also yesterday raised concerns over the refusal by Poland to allow Nigerians fleeing the conflict in Ukraine into the country even when nationals of other African countries were reportedly being allowed into Poland.\n\nThe minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, raised this issue on behalf of the government when he met with envoys of European Union countries in Abuja yesterday.\n\nOnyeama noted that the government was receiving emergency calls from Nigerians who were going by road, evacuating Ukraine and a lot of them heading to Poland.\n\n\u201cWe have had a number of calls, desperate calls and that there are cases of women and pregnant women and so forth,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nThe minister also said the government was informed that nationals of other African countries were being allowed into Poland and wondered why Nigerians were being denied entry into the country.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Polish Ambassador to Nigeria, Joanna Tarnawska, has however, assured him to immediately check with the capital in order to address the situation.\n\nNigeria is preparing to host the president and first lady of Poland, and it appears to the government as an aberration that a situation that people fleeing a global crisis like what is taking place in Ukraine should be prevented from getting out to safety.\n\n\u201cSo, we hope that also the European Union and others, and if that is indeed the case, will prevail on, not just necessarily Poland, but also any other border country to please share some sympathy and humanness to refugees fleeing this crisis, be they Nigerians or any other nationality,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nTarnawska, in her remarks, however said Poland was taking every necessary step to provide safety for those fleeing Ukraine.\n\nEarlier, the Head of the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Samuela Isopi, who led the delegation, said the meeting justified the importance that the EU attached to the issue of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nIsopi told Onyeama that the European Union was ready to assist Ukraine with help, including financial and humanitarian assistance.",

          "title": "Recruitment: VIPs Lose Out In NSCDC\u2019s 5,000 Jobs",
          "text": "The selection of 5,000 men and officers from the 1.5 million Nigerians who applied for vacancies into the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has not gone down with some prominent Nigerians. Their candidates did not make the final list.\n\nThe recruitment process started in 2019 and lasted till this year when the incumbent minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbsola and the commandant-general of the corps, Dr. Abubakar Ahmed Audi, concluded it.\n\nWhen the final list came out, LEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that some governors, senators and members of the House of Representatives, traditional rulers from some parts of the country and businessmen protested because their candidates were missing on it.\n\nConsequently, they mounted pressure on the minister and CG who allegedly insisted that in view of the precarious security situation, the federal government could afford to compromise on stands in the recruitment of men and officers into the NSCDC.\n\nIt was learnt that by the insistence on merit by the minister and the CG, the affected leaders went to high authorities to \u201cpress buttons\u201d but failed to realise their ambition as the presidency reportedly refused to intervene in the exercise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was learnt that it was against this backdrop that some governors cried out that the names of candidates in their states\u2019 allocations were alien to them.\n\nA credible source in the ministry of interior told LEADERSHIP Weekend; \u201cWe adhered strictly to the rules of fairness, justice and equity in the selection process.\u201d\n\nInvestigations revealed that both the minister and the NSCDC boss who inherited the selection process which began in 2019 ignored the sordid path that the recruitment process had often charted and refused to bow to pressures from influence peddlers in the country but ensured that the selected 5,000 recruits emerged through merit.\n\nThe source in the ministry said a former minister of interior who started the recruitment process, a former commandant-general, past and serving governors, senators and House of Representatives members were the worst hit because their lists enjoyed preferential treatment in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board (CDCFIB) opened its recruitment portal on August 9, 2019, where it later disclosed that 1.4 million Nigerians had scrambled for the 5,000 job openings advertised by the NSCDC.\n\nWhen the application portal was opened in 2019, about 1, 477, 042 Nigerians applied for various spots but using a set of criteria, the figure was pruned to 217,000 in March 2020 and 53,116 in December 2020. Sometime in 2022, the figure was again reduced to 6,500 before the final screening which arrived at the targeted 5,000.\n\nA top source at the board told LEADERSHIP Weekend that contrary to claims in some quarters, the process was hijacked by Aregbesola and Audi\u2019s predecessors, political and business heavyweights, who reserved slots for their preferred candidates through backdoor, \u201cWe could not risk the nation\u2019s future, development and progress by presenting less than the best for the job.\u201d\n\nUnder the old order, 10-40 percent of the total slots were reserved for the powers that be and later increased to between 40- 80 percent, a practice that had led to the less competent dominating the corps. However, Aregbesola and Audi stepped on every toe imaginable to achieve the goal of selecting only the most qualified 5,000 candidates.\n\nHowever, some aggrieved staff members of the board have argued that the usual \u201cwho gets what, how and why, the drama that characterised the over two years recruitment process brought to the fore, the wishy-washy manner in which individuals who were not even capable of spelling their names, but were highly favoured got key positions into the various sectors of the polity at the detriment of those who merited them.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted on certain allegations against key actors in the recruitment process, the director of public relations of the corps, DCC Olusola Odumosu, told our correspondent that the selection was purely on merit. He expressed shock at the news that some powerful toes were stepped on as he categorically said that no prominent Nigerian attempted to influence the process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is that all the classification of persons you listed are well meaning Nigerians who understand that the nation requires its best and brightest to pilot it through the turbulence of nationhood and the challenges of development. I strongly believe and I am aware that all former ministers of interior and CGs of the Civil Defence take this philosophy very seriously and strive often to put their best foot forward. For as much as I know them, favouritism, tribalism and playing the second team just does not suffice. Only the first eleven will do. I mean, the best.\u201d\n\nOdumosu said both the minister and his boss were ardent believers in the logic that the most qualified should get the job. They both do not give room to mediocrity in recruitment. There is ample evidence to show, he said.\n\n\u201cYes, selecting these 5,000 following the rot that had attended the system was no mean task. It was one which came with a lot of danger. It was not a job for the faint-hearted or the lily-livered. It was a job for the brave and lion-hearted. It was a job for the fearless and incorruptible. Aregbesola and Audi fit that bill,\u201d he said.\n\nOdumosu added; \u201cThe Civil Defence Corps understands that a drowsy work-force is not what we need in the country, especially at a time when the nation needs a surgical operation on all fronts to solve the myriad of problems confronting it on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cI can beat my chest to tell you that they both spearheaded institutional reforms through the establishment of due process mechanisms and strategies that became the nightmare of fraudulent persons. As far as this selection is concerned, the two leaders were fearless in the discharge of their duties and shunned attempts to compromise them. Yes, they spoke with authority and acted with finality against favouritism.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman added, \u201cMy boss is one person who firmly believes that Nigerians must go back to the days where merit, professionalism, expertise and willingness to work dominated the workforce which yielded viability and sustainability. He is of the school of thought that argues that leaders must begin the process of placing into leadership positions square pegs in square holes, so that efficiency can take the centre stage in our polity.\u201d\n\nFurther findings by our correspondent showed that those who were secretly offered employment and were gearing up to assume duties prior to Audi\u2019s resumption of office were thrown out.\n\nA source close to the interior ministry in Abuja said the federal government was deeply embarrassed by the controversy surrounding the NSCDC recruitment and would, therefore, not allow what it described as \u201cbackyard\u201d recruitment into the service.\n\nThe source said, \u201cI can say that the government prior to this final list, cancelled the backdoor recruitment exercise that was carried out and took appropriate steps to recruit in a transparent way.\n\nAlready, the Bauchi State House of Assembly has rejected the outcome of the recent recruitment process as it relates to the state, declaring it as a scam.\n\nThe resolution of the House followed the submission of the report of the Joint Committee on Security and Public Service on the exercise by the corps which was laid by Hon. Sabo Bako Sade, representing Sade Constituency.\n\nAccording to the report, the committee discovered that after the screening for the recruitment, the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the state communicated to the Assembly that there was a scam during the exercise in which seven of the 10 applicants whose names appeared on the state\u2019s list were discovered to be non-indigenes as reported by Hon. Jamilu Umaru Dahiru, the member representing Bauchi Central.\n\nThe committee has since recommended that the outcome of the exercise and communicate the same to the national headquarters of the NSCDC.\n\nAlso recently, Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum gave reasons why the nation\u2019s security system is seldom compromised.\n\nHe was quoted to have said, \u201cThese days, the governors, ministers and other top government functionaries have slots; nobody is to interview them whether they are qualified or not. Admission into the Nigerian Army, police and other security agencies are now politicised.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the undue influence of politicians has made it almost impossible for the country to get the required commitment and dedication from those recruited into the security agencies.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe major problem is the recruitment process, those being recruited into Nigerian Army, police, and other security agencies are job seekers, many of them are there because they don\u2019t have a job. Those enlisted 20 years ago are performing well but these people are looking for employment only, so there\u2019s no commitment and dedication.\u201d",

A close look at his body shows no sign of torture. He did not look unkempt. He was seen laughing even when he was told that he must be a rich kidnapper.\n\n\u201cIn court, he alleged that the recordings were staged, this is an afterthought and a ploy to escape Justice.\n\n\u201cI therefore found the first, second and fourth defendants guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and kidnapping and they are convicted as charged,\u201d he held.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the court discharged and acquitted Ogechi Uchechukw and two former soldiers of the Nigerian Army, Chilaka Ifeanyi and Victor Aduba for lack of sufficient evidence linking them to the crime.\n\nAfter the court judgment, the defence lawyers pleaded with the judge to temper justice with mercy by giving the convicts a second chance.\n\nAccording to him, they have demonstrated remorse and were first-time offenders.\n\nBut the judge disagreed with the defence lawyers that the convicts had shown remorse, saying they were unrepentant and they comfortably lied to the court.\n\nJustice Oshodi, therefore, held that the law must be applied to send the right message to the public that crime does not pay.\n\nThe state had claimed that the convicts committed the alleged offence between February 14 and April 12, 2017.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge is, however, yet to sentence the convicts as the proceedings are still ongoing.\n\nEvans is also facing similar charges before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo and Justice Adedayo Akintoye of the same court.",

          "title": "Agony Of Borno Student Whose Throat Was Slit For Refusing Errand",
          "text": "Jubril Sadi Mato (Ramadan), an 11-year-old pre-junior student of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri, woke up in the wee hours of January 15, 2022, had his ablution and observed his prayers with hope of a brighter day ahead.\n\nHe went about the activities of the day, full of life. But by nightfall, when most students had begun to retire to bed, Ramadan as he is fondly called, had his life almost snuffed out by his senior colleague.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that a senior colleague, from SS2 Class had sent Ramadan on an errand, but he refused to go.\n\nThat fateful night, the senior colleague then picked him up and took him to a lonely place and used a razor blade to severely cut his neck, injuring most of his artery nerves and trachea.\n\nHis attacker, who was later identified as Ahmad Umar Goni, left the victim to die with his body soaked in blood.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut after some minutes, Jubril struggled and found his way to the principal\u2019s office, before he finally broke down and became unconscious.\n\nJubril was rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) as he laid critical at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the perpetrator, who was alleged to be indoctrinated on psychotropic substances, was subsequently arrested and handed over to police for further investigations.\n\nA family member of the victim, who spoke with LEADERSHIP Weekend on condition of anonymity, noted that the case of Jubril had effectively been decriminalised as a result of a collapse in prosecutions that has allowed many offenders to escape justice and to go on to reoffend in the knowledge that they are highly unlikely to be held accountable.\n\nHe said for the fact that their acts of violence are normalised, accepted or excused, give a feeling of power and impunity to these individuals and encourages such recurrent shameful predatory behaviour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis support system, the family member of Jubril said, must be annihilated at all cost and in no uncertain terms.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first case of armed violence in the college, there are several other cases relating to sexual abuse and armed violence, but the school management had swept them under the carpet. This is likely to mean we are creating more victims as a result of our failure to act.\n\n\u201cThis can result in far-reaching and catastrophic consequences on the physical and mental state of any child. Because It is, amongst others, responsible for a decrease of academic performance and a high proportion of school dropouts, denying its victims the very right to education,\u201d he said.\n\nHe therefore appealed to Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Legal Aid Council and other reputable organisations and individuals to seek redress for Ramadan as his condition remained critical at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital.\n\nSome students of the school, who also spoke on the issue, claimed they were told by the management that Jubril attempted to commit suicide because he hated being a boarder.\n\nOne of the students, who craved anonymity, said, \u201cThey told us that he tried to kill himself with a razor blade by cutting himself. But we later learnt that it was one of our seniors who wounded him for refusing his errand.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know his present condition. I hope he is not dead?\u201d he said.\n\nA senior staff of the college, who also craved anonymity, said: \u201cOn the same day, a delegation from the Borno State Ministry of Education visited the college when the director departed to Damaturu, Yobe State, leaving his principals behind; they were told that the principals were not on site.\n\nThe source added that the suspect committed the act under the influence of drugs which were being secretly sold to students by a senior managing officer of the Junior Secondary School Section.\n\nAccording to him, the college management covered numerous cases of misconducts perpetrated by the students and some of the staff members without the knowledge of the parents, even though, the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA) was scrapped for years, following mass protest over increment and change of school uniforms by the management.\n\nIn a swift reaction to media reports on the incident, the principal, Mr Kashim Ibrahim Abdullahi, through a press statement signed and issued on the 22nd February, 2022, said the suspect, Ahmad Umar Goni, an SS2 student for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of pre- junior secondary school.\n\nThe statement added that the matter was immediately reported to the principal of the junior secondary school who rushed the victim to Borno State Specialist Hospital from where they were referred to the trauma centre of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), where Jubril has been receiving medical attention, adding that staff of the college queued up to donate blood for the victim and the school fully took financial responsibility.\n\nThe principal said according to the provision of the law of the land, the college has no right to treat crime cases of such magnitude and thus handed the culprit over to the police a few hours after the incident for further investigation.\n\nThe principal said:\u201d The management of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri issued this press statement regarding an incident that took place in the college on Saturday night, 15th January, 2022 at about 10: 05pm, immediately after prep.\n\n\u201cOne student Ahmad Umar Goni of SS2A for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of Pre-JSS.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some media houses, individuals as well as other critics of the college without any proof or verifiable evidence went on spreading false information when the college itself is still waiting for the police to conclude their investigation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the management of the college denounces all these conspiracies and fake news about the incident. For instance, several allegations were made against the college of allegedly conniving with the parents of the culprit and the guardian of the victim to conceal the fact about the incident.\n\n\u201cContrarily, the testimonies of both the parents in their media interactions debunked these allegations which were meant to dent the image of the college. It is also noteworthy to mention that such an incident has never occurred in the 47-year history of the college.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, Jubril is now getting better by Allah\u2019s grace. The management of the college, its entire staff and students sincerely sympathise with the family of the victim and earnestly pray for his full recovery. \u201c\n\nThe ministerial emergency committee for the investigation of attempted homicide at Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri was upgraded to state committee by the Zulum administration.\n\nThe committee was approved by Borno State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum on 25th January, 2022, to investigate the reported attack on a pre-JSS student, Jibril Sadi Mato, by a senior student on 15th January, 2022.\n\nThe setting up of the committee was contained in a statement signed by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Alhaji Usman Jidda Shuwa.\n\nShuwa stated that the committee was headed by the acting permanent secretary and solicitor-general of the Borno State Ministry of Justice, Abdullahi Husaini Izge, while it has directors of schools, ministry of education, representatives of civil society organisation, chairman of Borno State Parent and Teacher Association (PTA), representatives of Department of State Services (DSS),and the state police command, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) as well as the secretary of Cabinet Affairs, Governor\u2019s Office, among others.\n\nThe statement added that the committee will be inaugurated by the state deputy governor, Umar Usman Kadafur, at his office on Wednesday, 26th January, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, family members of the victim have decried the inability of the committee to make its findings public since over three weeks after the incident.\n\nThe family members through a statement issued by their lawyer wondered why no member of the family was represented in the committee.\n\nA cousin of Jubril Sadi Mato, Aisha Mato, while expressing worry over the continued delay in addressing the cause of the incident to our correspondent, said the victim has remained at home since he was discharged from the hospital and that the injuries which was not properly handled by UMTH is currently developing complications hence they want to take Jubril to an Egyptian hospital for further treatment.\n\nShe regretted that neither the school management nor the state government has reached out to them since their son was discharged from the intensive care unit of UMTH a fortnight ago despite countless efforts to ascertain the true situation that led to their son being cut on the neck.\n\nShe said: \u201cRamadan (Jubril\u2019s pet name) has not overcome the trauma of that incident. Since he was discharged from the hospital, he has refused to return to school or even agree to go to another school despite our efforts to get him enrolled in a new school. He keeps saying he does not want to go to school again because he will be killed.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, the unhealed injury has developed complications with his stomach swollen with constant foaming from his mouth. This is why we want to take him to a hospital in Egypt for proper medical attention.\n\n\u201cWe have been waiting for the state government to tell us the findings of their investigations but up to this moment, they have not said anything to us. The school management too has kept silent. We are at the crossroads at the moment because we don\u2019t even know what is happening.\n\n\u201cIt seems there is a conspiracy to sweep the matter under the carpet but we will not allow that to happen. We actually heard the rumour that the school management attempted to hide the incident from getting to the public space but we did not believe it, but with what is happening now, we tend to give credence to that rumour. But we will pursue this matter to a logical conclusion because we want justice for our son,\u201d the cousin said.\n\nCorroborating Aisha Mato, another cousin of Jubril, Adam Mato, said the victim, who has suddenly developed complications, needs further and urgent treatment in a better hospital.\n\nHe appealed to the state government and the school management to join the family and restore the health of Jubril whom he said is in urgent need of medical attention.\n\n\u201cThe management of the school is not even following up to know the condition of the boy. They have been nonchalant about the issue. It is very sad,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe claimed that UMTH had not been helpful by refusing them a referral letter that would assist the new hospital to understand the kind of treatment and where it stopped on the boy.\n\nHe said the UMTH management has been dribbling them whenever the request is made by the family.\n\nBut a credible source in UMTH who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there is no way the hospital can give them a referral letter after the boy had been discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe source said unless they bring him back on admission to be discharged with referral, the request won\u2019t be granted.",

          "title": "UPDATED: INEC Announces New Dates For 2023 Elections",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Saturday, announced new dates for the 2023 elections.\n\nThis was announced by the National Chairman of the commission, Professor Mahmood Yakubu at a news conference in Abuja, the Federal capital.\n\nAccording to him, the Presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while governorship and state houses of assembly elections will hold on March 11, 2023.\n\nYakubu explained that the new date is to allow for conformity with the provisions of the Electoral laws which stipulates that elections notice be published at least 260 days before the elections.\n\nREAD ALSO: Signing Of Electoral Act Amendment Bill Is Victory For Democracy, Says YIAGA Africa\n\nThe INEC boss also said the Electoral guidelines will also be published in due course.\n\nFrom the adjusted electoral timetable distributed to journalists, all political parties are expected to conduct party primaries and resolve all disputes arising from the primaries between April 4 to June 3, 2022.\n\nThe submission of nomination forms by political parties is scheduled as follows:\n\nPresidential and National Assembly: 10th June to 17th June 2022\n\nGovernorship and state assemblies: 1st July to 15th July 2022\n\nFind below the full statement by the INEC Boss below\u2026\n\nSTATEMENT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE HONOURABLE CHAIRMAN OF THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC), PROFESSOR MAHMOOD YAKUBU, ON THE RELEASE OF THE TIMETABLE AND SCHEDULE OF ACTlVITIES FOR THE 2023 GENERAL ELECTION HELD AT THE CONFERENCE ROOM, INEC HEADQUARTERS, ABUJA, ON SATURDAY 26TH FEBRUARY 2022\n\nLadies and Gentlemen of the Press.\n\n1.\u200b As you are aware, yesterday, Friday 25th February 2022, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed the Electoral Bill 2022 into law. This is historic being the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted. The 1998 \u2013 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law. Then, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\n2.\u200b You may recall that in 2017, the Commission decided to establish fixed dates for General Elections in Nigeria. This decision was based on our determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process (the electoral commission, political parties and candidates, security agencies, observers, the media etc.) to prepare adequately for elections. By that decision, Presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of the month of February of each General Election year, while Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later. Consequently, the 2023 General Election was scheduled to commence on 18th February 2023 with the Presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections on the 4th of March 2023. However, the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022. The Bill has now been signed into law.\n\n3.\u200b Therefore, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria. In particular, the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the General Election. One of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election which has now lapsed for the 2023 General Election.\n\n4.\u200b Consequently, the Commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 General Election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law. Accordingly, the Presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday 25th February 2023 while the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday 11th March 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 General Election is now 363 days away.\n\n5.\u200b Under the law, there are critical timebound activities from the publication of Notice of Election to the Conduct of Polls which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections. Some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows:\n\ni. Publication of Notice of Election \u2013 Monday 28th February 2022.\n\nii. Conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them \u2013 Monday 4th April 2022 to Friday 3rd June 2022.\n\niii. Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 9.00am on Friday 10th June 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 17th June 2022.\n\niv. Submission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 9.00am on Friday 1st July 2022 to 6.00pm on Friday 15th July 2022.\n\nv. Commencement of Campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 Wednesday 28th September 2022.\n\nvi. Commencement of Campaign by political parties for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 Wednesday 12th October 2022.\n\nvii. Last day of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday 23rd February 2023.\n\nviii. Last day of campaign by political parties for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday 9th March 2023.\n\n6.\u200b The detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election will be circulated to the media at the end of this briefing. Soft copies will also be uploaded to the Commission\u2019s website and social media platforms immediately. In addition, the Notice of Election will be published in our offices in all the States of the Federation as required by law on Monday 28th February 2022.\n\n7.\u200b With the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the Commission will work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act. These Regulations and Guidelines as well as Manuals issued by the Commission are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections. Their timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 General Election.\n\n8.\u200b On this note, I wish to remind stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the Commission. It is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates in order to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour.\n\n9.\u200b I thank you for attending this conference and God bless.",

We have diplomatic relations with Ukraine. It\u2019s a member of the United Nations, as well as Russia of course.\n\n\u201cWe urge that peace be prioritised by the two sides and we are very sad that the diplomatic process that was ongoing before this attack was cut short.\n\n\u201cWe support every effort being made to stop the aggression and that the Russian troops return to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine and the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nRussian President, Vladimir Putin, in the early hours of Thursday, ordered an invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was marked by shelling and rocket attacks on several Ukrainian major cities, including the capital, Kyiv.\n\nSaturday marks the third day of the invasion where according to the Ukrainian Health Minister, 198 civilians including three children have been confirmed dead.\n\nRussia also brushed off the barrage of Western sanctions and said it had fired cruise missiles at military targets.\n\nAccording to NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Ukrainian forces are putting up resistance and inflicting damage on Russia\u2019s military as it seeks to push deeper into the country.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Moment of peril\u2019 \u2013\n\nPutin had for weeks defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.\n\nHis announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia\u2019s army, navy, and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea thereby UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.\n\nBefore Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.\n\nWestern capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus, and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.\n\nMoscow\u2019s total forces are much larger \u2014 around a million active-duty personnel \u2014 and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.",

          "title": "Germany To Send Weapons To Ukraine In Policy Reversal",
          "text": "Germany on Saturday dramatically ramped up its backing for Ukraine\u2019s battle against Russia, approving weapons deliveries for Kyiv in a policy U-turn and agreeing to limit Moscow\u2019s access to the SWIFT interbank system.\n\n\u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point in history. It threatens our entire post-war order,\u201d said Chancellor Olaf Scholz as his government approved the delivery of a huge batch of lethal weapons to Kyiv.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, it is our duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in its defence against (Russian President) Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading army,\u201d said Scholz, stressing that Germany \u201cstands closely by Ukraine\u2019s side\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Russia Out!\u2019 Worldwide Protests In Solidarity With Ukraine\n\nIn a shift from its longstanding policy of banning weapons exports to conflict zones, Berlin is opening up its Bundeswehr store, pledging to transfer 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 \u201cStinger\u201d class surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.\n\nIt also finally approved the deliveries of 400 anti-tank rocket launchers via the Netherlands to Ukraine on Saturday.\n\nThe anti-tank launchers had been purchased by the Netherlands from Berlin, and The Hague had therefore required Germany\u2019s green light to hand them to Kyiv.\n\nLikewise, a weeks-long request from Estonia for the transfer to Ukraine of nine old Howitzers purchased from ex-communist East Germany won approval.\n\nBesides the weapons, 14 armoured vehicles will be handed over to Ukraine, and \u201cwill serve for the protection of personnel, possibly for evacuation purposes\u201d, said a government source.\n\nUp to 10,000 tonnes of fuel will also be sent through Poland to Ukraine, said the source, adding that other \u201cpossible support services is now being examined\u201d.\n\nWelcoming the decision, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted: \u201cKeep it up, Chancellor Olaf Scholz!\u201d\n\nFighting for \u2018our freedom\u2019\n\nKyiv has for weeks been pleading with Germany to send armaments to help face down an invasion by Russia.\n\nUkraine\u2019s wish list, seen by AFP, included mid-range anti-aircraft rocket systems, anti-drone rifles, microwave destruction systems and munitions.\n\nBut Scholz\u2019s coalition of his Social Democrats, Greens and liberal FDP has until now cited Germany\u2019s legacy of war guilt as a reason for not shipping lethal weapons to conflict zones.\n\nBerlin\u2019s obstinate refusal on weapons deliveries, and a previous decision to send only 5,000 helmets, had sparked anger and mockery.\n\nHours before Germany\u2019s key policy shift, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki became the latest leader to hit out at Berlin over its weapons exports stance as he arrived in the German capital for talks with Scholz.\n\n\u201cFive thousand helmets? That must be some kind of joke. There needs to be real help\u2026 weapons,\u201d he said, stressing that Ukraine is not just fighting for itself.\n\n\u201cThey are also fighting for us. For our freedom, our sovereignty. So that we aren\u2019t next in line,\u201d he said.\n\nMorawiecki had also voiced frustration with Berlin for dawdling on agreeing \u201ccrushing\u201d sanctions, including booting Russia out of the SWIFT system that banks rely on to transfer money.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner had earlier this week laid out starkly the preoccupation of Europe\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nThe suspension of SWIFT \u201cwould mean that there is a high risk that Germany will no longer receive gas, raw material supplies from Russia\u201d, he said.\n\nLindner told public television he was \u201copen\u201d to including SWIFT \u201cin the course of possible further toughening of sanctions\u201d, while adding that allies would \u201chave to be aware of the consequences\u201d.\n\nBut with pressure mounting from allies, Berlin said it was now working on excluding Russia from the system in a \u201ctargeted and functional\u201d way.\n\n\u201cWe are working at the same time urgently on limiting the collateral damage from an exclusion from SWIFT so that (the measure) hits the right people,\u201d Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a targeted and functional limitation of SWIFT,\u201d they added.\n\nThe plan would be to directly exclude Russian banks already hit by EU sanctions.\n\nViewed as a \u201cfinancial nuclear weapon\u201d, a banishment from SWIFT would leave a country severely crippled in its ability to trade with others.\n\nIran was disconnected from the system between 2012 and 2016 over its nuclear programme.\n\nAFP",
