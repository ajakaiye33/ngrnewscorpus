Ekhaguere.\n\nA statement on behalf of the state government and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, on Monday, expressed the delight of the state Governor, Willie Obiano, in a letter to President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), earlier on Sunday.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cBy being among the three most recent NNOM laureates, Chidume has helped to elongate the list of winners of Nigeria\u2019s most prestigious award for academic excellence from Anambra State.\u201d\n\nAccording to the commissioner, all the NNOM recipients from Anambra State will be among the indigenes of the state to be honoured at the ceremony marking the state\u2019s 30th anniversary which would have been held last August 27 but for the November 6 gubernatorial election in the state, was shifted.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will continue to honour men and women of outstanding learning because education explains the difference between a developed society and an undeveloped one.\n\n\u201cIt is as a result of the premium paid to education by the Governor Obiano administration that Anambra has posted far better results than any state in Nigeria in the last seven years, almost habitually winning the first position in every external examination involving schoolchildren.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, expressed optimism that with Chukwuma Charles Soludo, a globally respected economics professor, assuming office as governor on March 17, the state will become far more competitive in education and other sectors.\n\nChidume, an indigene of Nimo in Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State, waa trained at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Queen\u2019s University in Canada as well as the Ohio State University in the United States.\n\nHe died at the age of 74 last year while serving as the acting President of the African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, after a successful long period at the UNN as an outstanding scholar.\n\nThe statement added that though the NNOM honour is like the Nobel Prize, awarded annually only to living individuals and organisations, Chidume received it from Buhari last week, because when he was selected as a laureate in 2020, he was still alive.\n\nIt added that the awards could not be held last year on account of the lockdown arising from the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Steve Oko\n\nAs intrigues and political activities for the 2023 elections gradually gather momentum, Abia \u2013 based Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, have vowed to campaign against any political party that would not honour the power rotation arrangement in the state otherwise known as Abia Charter of Equity.\n\nThe groups which addressed newsmen in Umuahia under the auspices of Abia Civil Society Network on Equity and Justice, ACSNEJ, urged political parties to respect the Charter of Equity put in place by the founding fathers in selecting their governorship candidate for 2023.\n\nAccording to them, any attempt to alter the arrangement will disrupt the prevailing peace in the state, encourage injustice, and engender unnecessary political rancor among the three senatorial zones.\n\nThe CSOs argued that since power rotated from Abia North in 1999, and had gone round all three zones, \u201cequity and justice demand that power should return to Abia North in 2023\u201d.\n\nACSNEJ, in a text jointly signed by Comrade Diaman Ogudike, Convener; and Comrade Nnanna Nwafor; Ambassador Darlington Kalu; Goodluck Ibem; and Comrade Nnamdi Elekwachi, Co-conveners, read at the briefing, expressed support for Abia Charter of Equity.\n\nThe CSOs raised alarm over plots by some power hawks to truncate the zoning arrangement, warning of the consequences of such self-centered move.\n\n\u201cThe attention of ACSNEJ has been drawn to a thickening plot to perpetuate injustice and political exclusion in Abia State with an unheard-of arrangement aimed at keeping a Zone in office as governor in what could be described as self-succession at best.\n\n\u201cFrom what is evident within the state polity, including from moves and consultations by some gladiators whose senatorial zones have either previously had a stint or are currently doing their tenure, we are sensing the plot to deny the people of Abia North their turn at the governorship in the state, even when it is their turn, legitimately. This, we wish to state as a coalition, does not present Abia government and her people a win-win situation.\n\n\u201cThose who now champion the cause to keep power to Abians of Ngwa extraction or any other groups within Abia Centra or South challenge the wisdom of great men like Jaja Wachukwu, Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibaiam and other illustrious sons and daughters of the state.\n\n\u201cThe essence of sticking to the Abia Equity Charter is to stop people jockeying for power in a Machiavellian way; to end dog eat dog politics; to create a sense of equity and evenness among Abians.\n\n\u201cThose who today want to truncate the already existing peaceful political landscape in Abia are no wiser than the founding fathers.\n\n\u201cWe wish to sound this as a warning to all aspirants outside of Abia North to shelve their plans and allow governorship of the state to come to the deserving Zone which in all fairness is Abia North.\n\n\u201cWe call on all political parties within the state to ensure that the North-Central-South power-sharing formula be followed come 2023, as anything short of that will amount to injustice which we shall legitimately resist.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that some persons who enjoyed the support of Abia North to ascend to power are now midwiving the plot to stop the zone from doing its own turn in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe call on all the political parties in the state and other well-meaning sons and daughters of the state to resist this move which will only create chaos and enthrone division, hate, and mistrust within the Abia body politics.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\n\nThe coalition of top operators of the nation\u2019s organised private sector has raised N100 billion with which to assist security agencies in tackling the persistent insecurity across the country.\n\nThe Group Chairman of United Bank for Africa (UBA), Mr. Tony Elumelu, who dropped the hint at the Group Chairman\u2019s Forum, in Abuja, Saturday night, said that it was akin to the N60 billion raised by the private sector under the CACOVID to enable the government tackle the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nAccording to him, the private sector has been playing increasing roles in helping to keep the economy afloat.\n\nHis words, \u201cIt was during COVID that some Nigerians were able to know what the private sector could do under the Governor.\n\n\u201cJust in case some don\u2019t know, we set up isolation centres across the country. We spent not less than N60 billion.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing was the move we made to open up the Nigerian economy once more. We made a strong move. We had no option. The economy would have crashed if we didn\u2019t do so. And there was so much pressure on the government\u2026\n\n\u201cThen, post-COVID (not that COVID is completely over) we spent so much money for people to vaccinate; even supporting government agencies with money to enable them do so many things to keep Nigeria healthy and safe. I like where acts of patriotism are discussed because it gets me happy.\n\n\u201cBut the most important thing, I\u2019m sure my members would not like me to talk about it. We have just put N100bn together, private sector again, under this coalition to help fight insecurity or to support our security agencies, to be able to deal with the issues we are having in the country on security.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if they are well armed, it will go a long way in helping to assure security in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. GodwinEmefiele, commended Mr. Elumelu for growing UBA into a banking group that now flies the Nigerian flag in 20 African countries, the United Kingdom, United States of America and France, with a recent approval to open another subsidiary in the United Arab Emirate (UAE).\n\nHe urged UBA and other banks to invest more in the agricultural sector, in the pursuit of the diversification of the nation\u2019s economy from oil.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI would like to encourage the management of UBA to build on the gains recorded by providing access to credit and supporting small businesses in these critical areas with funding and technical assistance.\n\n\u201cGiven the extent of your branch networks across Nigeria and indeed in Africa, I believe that you can leverage on your knowledge of the local economy to lend to households and businesses as well as provide tailored products and services that meet the needs of your customers in these critical sectors.\n\n\u201cIf we commit today to increasing investments in modernizing agriculture, providing skills, finance and better access to food value chains, agriculture has the potential to become a thriving and successful sector that creates jobs and provides livelihoods for small-scale farmers and rural populations-in particular, for millions of young Africans joining the job market.\n\n\u201cThe creation of the appropriate policy initiatives to address the identified challenges is a charge we at the Central Bank of Nigeria have championed with some have results.\u201d\n\nThe new policy direction, the CBN boss said, has become imperative given the overdependence on oil for the nation\u2019s revenue and foreign exchange.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn assumption of office as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria in June 2014, I indicated that my ultimate objective as Governor would be to ensure that the CBN is noted for being a people focused central bank where the decisions taken at the MPC must be those that impact directly on the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cThis objective was driven by some of the key challenges facing the Nigerian economy,",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIn the last one month, ASUU national officers, zones and branches mobilised and sensitised members in public universities about the Federal Government failure to address their demands.\n\nASUU zones and branches held press briefings and told Nigerians to hold the Federal Government responsible if after the NEC meeting, the union opts for a strike.\n\nOne of the lingering issues between the government and the union include renegotiation of the 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement, which ASUU insists should be reviewed every three years.\n\nHowever, nine months after the renegotiation concluded in May 2021, ASUU said the government has refused to sign and implement the contents of the renegotiated agreement.\n\nSome students and parents, who spoke to Daily Sun, expressed fears about what might be the outcome of the ASUU NEC meeting.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that ASUU national president, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, would today (Monday) address newsmen on the outcome of the NEC meeting.\n\nIt was also learnt that the union may first declare a warning strike after the meeting in Lagos and should the government not yield to its demands declare a full scale industrial action.\n\nA 300 level student of Sociology, University of Abuja, Cecelia Eke fearing another strike as outcome of the meeting said: \u201cNot again please! I have spent extra years in school due to incessant ASUU strike, in addition to COVID-19 that disrupted our academic calendar in 2020. One of my course mate was forced to withdraw from our school to start a fresh programme in a private university after the COVID-19 lockdown and ASUU strike that started before then.\u201d\n\nDaniel Ayu, whose son is studying at the University of Nigeria (UNN) said he\u2019s closely monitoring the situation and won\u2019t hesitate to withdraw his son and enroll him in a private university.\n\nHe appealed to ASUU NEC not to consider the option of strike as it would have more devastating effect on students who would suffer delayed and disrupted academic programmes.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

The group stated this in a statement issued in Abuja. It accused the governors of embarking on a selfish mission ahead of the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe allegation was contained in a statement: \u201cHow governors Mohammed Badaru, Atiku Bagudu, Kayode Fayemi, and others have plotted to impose Senator Sani Musa and others as national chairman, Excos to satisfy the selfish interest of projecting Badaru/Fayemi ticket for 2023 Presidency\u201d read by the secretary of the group, Chief Tobias Ogbeh.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cWe are constrained to invite you for this press briefing following our discovery of a plot to sabotage the APC by some desperate individuals that are working internally to implode the party. Ordinarily, the affairs of the APC should be left as its internal matters except that the people we are raising this alarm about, today, are not really after the APC. What they are after is the soul of Nigeria, which they want to own for their evil intent.\n\n\u201cAll the evil that this cabal has perpetrated in the past months are geared towards illegally winning public offices at the highest level, so that they can continue to pillage the country and make a mockery of the progress that an APC government at the centre has brought to Nigeria by reversing all the gains made in the past six years.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we are raising the alarm now, so that Nigerians will know that people with less than sincere interest are on the verge of hijacking the APC and consequently impose a presidential candidate on Nigerians, use the popularity of the APC to win election and then capture power to the detriment of Nigerians. Therefore, the matter is no longer an internal issue of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe forum alleged that the governors have hijacked the entire exercise given the way they fixed February 26, as date for the convention in flagrant disregard to the preferences expressed by stakeholders.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cNigerians would be deprived of having an APC presidential candidate that passed the rigours of primary election. Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State and their other desperate allies that include serving ministers have perfected plans to ensure that Senator Sani Musa is imposed as APC national chairman alongside other lackeys that would be named to other positions at the convention. Senator Sani Musa would, in turn, deliver Bagudu as APC presidential flag-bearer and Kayode Fayemi as his running mate. They have cooked up what they called \u2018unity list\u2019 to package their evil plot as something positive and desirable for the party and the country when the contrary is the case. We want APC stakeholders and Nigerians to know that these state governors are working against the interest of the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an APC group, under the auspices of Concerned APC Members Forum, has petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari, to intervene in the crisis facing the party on the choice of its national chairman.\n\nThe forum, in the petition, signed by its convener, Okpokwu Ogenyi, in Abuja, yesterday, commended the president\u2019s resilience in safeguarding the soul of the APC, urging him to minimise the crises in the party ahead of the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cJudging by the activities of the various actors, we appeal to Mr. President not to allow the selfish interest of the presidential ambition of some ranking members to destroy the party. We want Mr. President to recommend a highly committed and disciplined member, a man of humility and resilience with acute knowledge of party administration that will respect both former and serving governors, senators, ministers, party faithfuls, and of course, the leaders of our party.\n\n\u201cThis will go a long way in reducing internal crisis in the party, controlling the expenditure of some aspirants, and solving the problem of reconciliation after the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe recommend Mr. President call a meeting of all the aspirants for the National Chairmanship position and hand over the preferred candidate to them, instructing an all-inclusive government.\n\n\u201cThis will immediately heal any injury in the heart of anybody and the explanation to his supporters on why he stepped down.

          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has condemned Canada for repressing truckers who were protesting over COVID-19 mandates and other restrictions in the country as insurrectionists. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, yesterday, said the action of the Canadian government amounted to double standard.\n\nMohammed\u2019s condemnation was a veiled reference to the anti-Nigeria government stance of Canada and other countries during the #EndSARS protest in October 2020, which culminated in the blockage of public roads and massive destruction of government and private property.\n\nThe minister wondered why all of a sudden, protesters who barricaded roads had been branded as threats to public safety and subjected to a number of clampdowns by the Canadian government and private organisations. He said the Ontario government had frozen access to millions of dollars donated through online fundraising platform to the truckers while GoFundMe had shut down the campaign to raise funds for the protesters.\n\nSimilarly, he recalled that Twitter, which allegedly funded #EndSARS protesters and even helped them to raise fund, had also blocked the truckers\u2019 account.\n\n\u201cThese are the same entities that are now rushing to distance themselves from the protesters in Canada and even denying them the use of their platforms,\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is similar to what played out during the January 6th 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol in Washington, D.C. where those involved are either still being investigated or have been charged to court. I don\u2019t blame them. Nobody wants their country destroyed under the guise of protests.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand this intervention. We are not gloating over the unfortunate development in Canada. But we are only calling attention to the double standard involved in the way protesters deemed to be violent are perceived in Nigeria and in the West.\u201d\n\nHe derided the double standard of those who had referred to hoodlums who destroyed public and private property in Nigeria under the guise of #EndSARS as peaceful protesters, while tagging similar protesters in their own countries as \u201cinsurrectionists and terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe minister said no one would be talking of freedom of expression or freedom of association and the likes guaranteed by the constitution if there was no Nigeria. He said the country\u2019s destruction would not be allowed under the guise of protest or unbridled freedoms.\n\nHe also boasted that Nigeria was far ahead of most countries in the world, which had now realised the need to regulate social media in the interest of their own people.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says $2bn disbursed to over 3 million farmers\n\n*Elumelu: Private sector pools N100bn to stem insecurity\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has predicted 10 per cent increase in credit to the agricultural sector over the next two years.\n\nHe also said about $2 billion out of about $2.5 billion, earmarked for key initiatives in the manufacturing, mining and agriculture, services sectors had been disbursed to over three million farmers cultivating over 4.7 million hectares of arable land in the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) under the Anchors Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP).\n\nSpeaking at a dinner session with the board of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) in Abuja over the weekend, he noted that over 80 per cent of the fund was targeted at the agricultural sector.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, UBA Group, Mr. Tony Elumelu, revealed that the private sector coalition has put together the sum of N100 billion to help fight insecurity and boost the capacity of security agencies, to be able to deal with the issues challenges facing the country.\n\nEmefiele said following the intervention programmes embarked upon by the central bank since his assumption of office, the initiatives have helped farmers to significantly improve their yields and contributed significantly towards Nigeria\u2019s journey towards food self-sufficiency.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor example, we have seen the re-emergence of the rice pyramids. Rice production has increased to over 7.5 million metric tons yearly, from less than four million metric tons recorded in 2015, prior to the introduction of Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP).\n\n\u201cThere were only 15 standard rice mills in Nigeria before the launch of the Anchor Borrowers Programme. As at today, we have over 50 standard and integrated rice mills creating jobs and reducing unemployment.\n\n\u201cAll these were done in partnership with deposit money banks who serve as our identification, risk appraisal and distribution mechanism for these interventions.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said economic recovery had been aided by the growth of over four million farmers, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and manufacturers who are creating and growing businesses that are enabling growth in manufacturing and ICT due to improved access to credit.\n\nHe said credit to the manufacturing had risen from 10 per cent in 2014, to 16 per cent in 2021, while agriculture also witnessed growth in credit from three per cent in 2013 to six per cent in 2022.\n\nIn his remarks on, \u201cFood Security, Job Creation and the Role of the Central Bank,\u201d the CBN governor who was special guest at the forum, stressed the critical role of banks and financial institutions in enabling more inclusive growth of the economy following the series of external shocks that had confronted economies globally.\n\nSpecifically, he pointed out that central banks and the financial system have critical roles to play in powering the solutions to the issues of food security and job creation on the African continent.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cOn assumption of office as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria in June 2014, I indicated that my ultimate objective as Governor would be to ensure that the CBN is noted for being a people focused central bank where the decisions taken at the MPC must be those that impact directly on the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cThis objective was driven by some of the key challenges facing the Nigerian economy, one of which was our heavy reliance on revenues and foreign exchange earnings from the sale of crude oil.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cClose to 60 per cent of government revenues and 80 per cent of our foreign exchange earnings came from the sale of crude oil, even though the petroleum sector represents less than 10 per cent of our GDP.\n\n\u201cOur dependence on earnings for crude oil fueled an excessive dependence on imports, which came at the expense of constraining growth in critical sectors of our economy such as agriculture and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cIt also exposed our economy to volatilities associated with changes in the price of crude oil in global markets.\u201d\n\nEmefiele noted that with an annual population growth rate of close to 2.8 per cent, it was important that all efforts are concentrated at ensuring that employment opportunities were available for Nigerians particularly in sectors that had the ability to absorb key segments of the growing population, particularly agriculture and manufacturing, which represented 10 per cent and 27 per cent of GDP respectively in 2014.\n\nHe lamented that notwithstanding the relevance of these sectors, sectoral credit allocation remained low relative to credit to the oil and gas sector, which stood at close to 29 per cent in 2014.\n\nAccording to him, in contrast, credit to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors stood at 10 per cent and three per cent respectively.\n\nEmefiele said given the country\u2019s population of over 200 million along with favorable youth demographics, \u201cWe were aware that if the necessary support was provided to households and business such as improved access to finance, and better infrastructure these measures would boost productivity, and help in enabling greater direct investment flows into our economy.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a result, there was a growing recognition on the need to refine our monetary policy tools and regulatory framework in order to ensure that it was more responsive to the needs of the Nigerian populace.\n\n\u201cIt was important that this new framework enabled the flow of credit by financial institutions to critical sectors in order to aid our efforts at driving productive activities and creating job opportunities for our growing population.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that investments in agriculture and related sectors, distribution storage systems, and necessary market infrastructure remained critical to building a cost-effective, viable and sustainable food system in Africa.\n\nHe, nonetheless, encouraged the management of UBA to build on the gains recorded by providing access to credit and supporting small businesses in these critical areas with funding and technical assistance.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the extent of your branch networks across Nigeria and indeed in Africa, I believe that you can leverage on your knowledge of the local economy to lend to households and businesses as well as provide tailored products and services that meet the needs of your customers in these critical sectors.\n\n\u201cBy providing support to them you are also enabling communities to thrive.\n\n\u201cAs we all work together in supporting these critical sectors, it would mean more jobs and greater economic growth in our Communities.\n\n\u201cIt also ensures that not only do we continue to grow our economy, but that growth is broad based and inclusive.\n\n\u201cAgain, the journey to the Africa of our dream must be a collaborative one where all play our parts.\u201d\n\nElumelu, in his earlier remarks, explained that the private sector believed well- armed security operatives would go a long way in helping to assure on security of the nation.\n\nHe noted that it was under the COVID-19 pandemic that some Nigerians realised what the private sector could do under the leadership of the CBN governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the most important thing was the move we made to open up the Nigerian economy once more.\n\n\u201cWe made a strong move. We have no option; the economy would crash if we don\u2019t do so. And there was so much pressure on the government.\u201d\n\nHe commended the act of patriotism displayed by the private, including the banks in acting with a sense of urgency to save the country from the brinks at such a demanding period.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* It\u2019s impossible to hijack monies allocated under scheme, insists works ministry\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has begun work on the 21 roads for which N621 billion was recently earmarked by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) under the Tax Credit Scheme (TCS).\n\nThe implementation of the scheme coincided with a statement by the Ministry of Works led by Mr. Babatunde Fashola, that contrary to the position of some workers\u2019 union, the programme was being run in such a way that it\u2019s not possible to hijack the funds.\n\nPetroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) had last week alleged that the monies for the rehabilitation of the 21 critical road infrastructure in the country had been hijacked by politicians and persons in the concerned ministry.\n\nSpeaking during a press briefing in Abuja, National Chairman of the PTD, Mr Salmon Oladiti, told journalists that some persons were bent on frustrating the repairs programme as agreed by the stakeholders.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), in a separate briefing, had urged Fashola to speed up the awards of the contracts and, \u201cexercise extreme care in the supervision, monitoring and payment so as to ensure value for money in contract execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has become imperative to avoid substandard or poor work execution. In fact, we recommend that a committee comprising stakeholders should be set up to help in the supervision and monitoring exercise to ensure speedy completion of the work before the rainy season,\u201d NARTO National President, Yusuf Othman, had also stated.\n\nThe NNPC is financing the programme through the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme in collaboration with the federal ministry of works and housing and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\nBut speaking at the weekend during the inspection of the ongoing work on the Suleja- Minna highway, Phase I and II; and the reconstruction of Lambata -Lapai-Bida road in Niger State which are among the roads to be financed under the scheme, Director, Highways Construction and Rehabilitation, Mr Folorunso Esan, stated that work had since started on the roads.\n\nEsan said that adequate funds had been released to the contractors through the governance process established to ensure prompt delivery of the road projects, adding that no contractor had any reason not to deliver as scheduled.\n\nThe ministry clarified that given the governance process put in place for the scheme, it was impossible for the ministry officials or any other person to \u201chijack\u201d the funds for any other purpose as was recently alleged.\n\nIt also noted that with many of the construction companies just resuming from the yuletide break, work had resumed on the sites, with earth works progressing.\n\nHe disclosed that the inspection team was among others reasons, on site to prevail on the contractors to accelerate work to ensure early completion and delivery of the roads.\n\nEsan said the ministry would carry out the appropriate tests to determine the quality and the durability of the construction work to ensure compliance with acceptable standard.\n\nHe pleaded with road users, especially truck drivers to be patient with the government and construction workers as they ply the roads while construction work is going on.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting that before the rainy season, all the challenging spots will be addressed so that the outcry from the truck and tanker drivers will not be there,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the director, inadequate funding which used to be a major challenge has been permanently solved through the NNPC scheme because the company would fund the road projects to completion.\n\nHe added that the Suleja-Minna \u201cdualisation\u201d, which was projected to be completed in January 2024 would be completed much earlier due to the availability of fund.\n\nOn the Bida- Lapai-Lambata road, the Federal Controller of Works, Niger State, Samotu Moshood, explained that 46 kilometres, amounting to 36 per cent of the work had been completed.\n\nThe Project Manager of Messrs. Salini Nigeria Limited, Daniel Kassa, the contractor handling the Suleja-Minna Road, disclosed that the company had been fully mobilised to the site with adequate funds.\n\nAlso, Project Manager, China Global Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Chen Xian, the contractor handling the Bida-Lapai-Lambata highway, revealed that the government had fully mobilised his company to the site.\n\nXian who lamented that scarcity of water, was currently a hindrance to the progress of work with the onset of dry season, assured road users that the bad spots would have been worked on before the rainy season\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There are serious doubts and unanswered questions bordering on the qualification of Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) for the position. The FUTO Branch Committee\u2019s report failed to justify Dr. Isah Ali Ibrahim\u2019s (Pantami\u2019s) appointment to professor on the basis of requisite experience, professional suitability and antecedents at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa (ATBU).\u201d\n\nSee Also Politics BUSTED: How Terror-linked Minister, Pantami Accepted Federal University\u2019s Professorship Five Months Before Appointment By Institution\n\nIn September 2021, the Governor of Zamfara state, Bello Matawalle, placed commercials in newspapers congratulating Pantami on his promotion to a Professor of Cybersecurity.\n\n\n\nPantami was among seven Readers (Associate Professors) promoted to Professor by the Governing Council of Federal Univerity of Technology Owerri (FUTO) at its 186th meeting held on August 20, 2021.\n\n\n\nThis triggered criticisms around Pantami\u2019s appointment in some sections of the media.\n\n\n\nThe United States Associate Professor and social critic, Farooq Kperogi, at the time described the Professorship granted by the university to Pantami as \u201csome self-humiliating intellectual duplicity perpetrated by Pantami himself.\u201d\n\nNigerians have described Pantami as a closet extremist after the Islamist views he held in the past came to light in 2021.\n\nThe Muhammadu Buhari government, however, said it would stand by the minister.\n\nPantami expressed views sympathetic to groups such as al-Qaeda and Boko Haram.\n\n\n\nIn a sermon from the 2000s, he said he considered al-Qaeda founder, Osama Bin Laden, a better Muslim than himself. For instance, in a 2006 speech, he publicly offered his condolences after the death of al-Qaeda's leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nIn another, he said he was happy when infidels were massacred.",

          "text": "Stitch, a South African API fintech company, announced today that it has closed a $21 million Series A funding round, led by The Spruce House Partnership.\n\nThe funding round also saw participation from PayPal Ventures, TrueLayer, Firstminute Capital, The Raba Partnership, CRE Venture Capital, Village Global, Zinal Growth (the investment vehicle of Checkout.com founder Guillaume Pousaz) and others, including founders of Chipper Cash, Quovo, and Unit.\n\nThis new funding sets the company\u2019s total funding at $27 million after it launched out of stealth mode in February 2021 with $4 million seed and the $2 million extensions round that followed in October.\n\nStitch offers data and payments solutions that reduce the effort required for businesses to connect to their users\u2019 financial accounts and enable bank-to-bank payments without leaving the existing app interface. Their infrastructure-led approach supports several use cases, including KYC and onboarding, personal and business financial management, lending, wallet top-ups, e-commerce checkouts, and more.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly fortunate to be supported by some of the best investors, founders, and builders in the fintech space globally,\u201d said Stitch co-founder and CEO Kiaan Pillay. \u201cThey are working closely with us to enable the boom we\u2019re seeing in financial technology on the continent. Across the hundreds of customers we work with, big and small, we\u2019re witnessing a record pace of development of new financial products.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, while announcing their expansion into Nigeria, Pillay said that Stitch would use APIs to \u201cdramatically reduce the challenges that come with building across African geographies.\u2019\u2019 He also introduced what he refers to as \u201cfinancial graphs\u201d, an infrastructure for financial building blocks that can interoperate across regions, providers, banks, and other types of financial accounts, allowing businesses to write code once, launch in multiple markets, and scale more quickly.\n\nToday the company is walking the talk as it said the new investment will go into creating the financial graph, while continuing to build the future of money movement by linking bank accounts, wallets, and other stores of value across Africa.\n\nFintech is gradually becoming the largest sector in Africa, having brought the biggest cheque into the country last year and that before. So, it\u2019s very important to build a connecting trail between these products, and that\u2019s where fintech products like Mono, Okra, and Stitch has plugged themselves.\n\nThe company, in a statement, listed fast-growing businesses from wallet-based companies like Chipper Cash, Luno and Zapper, to financial services providers like ImaliPay, to subscription and e-commerce players like FlexClub, to PSPs and payment aggregators like Peach and Yoco as its partners.\n\n\u201cWe have been following startups in Africa for many years. Our diligence was very clear that this is one of the most talented teams on the continent, and we are excited to be a part of what they are building at Stitch,\u201d said Ben Stein, co-founder of The Spruce House Partnership.\n\nThe company said the funding will also be going into significantly expanding the team, launching new product offerings, and entering new markets across the continent. It\u2019s already operating in 2 out of Africa\u2019s 4 largest fintech markets\u2014South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nIn the last quarter alone, the company said that it saw 44% month-on-month (MoM) customer growth and a 72% MoM increase in linked financial accounts on the platform. It\u2019s had 104% MoM growth in payments value since launch.\n\n\u201cStitch is building critical infrastructure to enable faster, easier, and more secure payments across Africa,\u201d said Ashish Aggarwal, Director at PayPal Ventures. \u201cWe believe they will play a significant role in contributing to the overall growth of the fintech space in Africa, and we are excited to be investing at this important moment in their journey.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 11 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, Abdulfatai Suleiman, and Prosper Ubi is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360-degree business launchpad: business registration, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nWe think this startup is building a game-changing product; something that will have a significant impact on the growth of African startups.\n\nWe know you have some startups you are rooting for this year that we might have missed. Please tell us about them in the comment section below.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Zach George: From Wall Street to investing in African startups",
          "text": "2010 was a watershed moment in football. For the first time, the World Cup was hosted by an African country. 3.2 billion people watched the matches from their homes while 3.18 million fans attended the matches live in South Africa\u2014Zach George was one of them.\n\nGeorge, who was born in Oman, had spent the past 5 years on Wall Street as an investment banker at Barclays Bank and Lehman Brothers. He was in South Africa looking for a new adventure.\n\n\u201cI moved to South Africa in 2010 to watch the World Cup. I also kept an eye out for opportunities to run an accelerator program because, at the time, there were no real accelerators in Africa,\u201d George said.\n\nWhile Spain went on to lift the 2010 World Cup, George spotted an opportunity to do something different on the African continent. He started his journey as a Specialist Financial Advisor at Old Mutual, then led operations at U-Start, a global boutique investment advisory firm, before a brief stint as Programme Director, Barclays Tech Lab Africa.\n\nIn 2017, he co-founded Startupbootcamp, the first and largest multi-corporate-backed tech venture accelerator on the African continent.\n\n\u201cIt was quite a challenging task because, at the time, none of these large corporations\u2014banks and telcos\u2014had much interest in working with startups. It was a difficult task convincing them to put money into accelerator programmes not in exchange for equity, but to do proof of concept and pilots with these fintech, health-tech, and logistics-tech companies.\u201d\n\nFortunately, George and the Startupbootcamp team were able to pull it off. \u201cFrom 2017 to 2019, we saw the number of startups increase across Africa. We eventually settled on 10 companies per cohort. Notably, in the 2018 cohort, one of our top companies was Kuda Bank, which is now worth about $500 million. When they came to our programme we invested $20,000 for an 8% stake, which was a good deal at that time.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, sensing that the African ecosystem was mature, George decided to move on from building accelerators in Africa to setting up a fund that could invest in startups and graduates of world-class accelerators.\n\n\u201cIt started with the question of, where do you go for your first proper institutional round of funding, if you\u2019re looking for seed funding as a startup?\u201d\n\nThis question birthed Launch Africa Ventures, a $30 million pan-African fund that has invested in 85 companies in 17 African countries. Our conversation started off with a look at George\u2019s career choice.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Your first degree was in engineering and since then you\u2019ve moved on to finance. Why?\n\nZach George: Engineering is a great base degree because you learn about the fundamentals of logic and analysis, but engineering, most times, is not a forward-facing job. I\u2019m the kind of person that enjoys being in front of people doing presentations; this explains why I pivoted to jobs like investment banking, management consulting, or other roles where you have a lot of client exposure. So that was a reason I moved out of engineering.\n\nI think the skills you learn as an engineer are useful in the investment banking space. If you look at most investment banks, they hire engineers because their quantitative skills are great. They really understand algorithms and logic.\n\nEngineering is helpful inorder to understand the fundamentals of physics, economics, logic, and the flow of information. But being able to build a product is not enough; you have to be able to monetise it and make a business out of it. And that\u2019s why the perfect combination, if you ask me, is to get an undergrad degree in engineering, like computer science, electrical, or mechanical engineering, and then go and get an MBA. You learn how to monetise your product from the business perspective, and that\u2019s something I was fortunate to be able to do.\n\nMost smart engineers that get into business are eventually forward-facing\u2014think of Bill Gates or Elon Musk.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t encourage everyone to become an investment banker; I\u2019m just saying that if you\u2019ve spent a few years as a banker or management consultant at McKinsey or BCG, you really understand the basics of leadership. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, you have to be a leader. You need to be able to manage a team and clients, HR, internal processes, and partnerships. It\u2019s not easy so you need to have a pretty solid degree in business organisational behaviour, decision analysis, and risk analysis, and that\u2019s where a combination of engineering and businesses is super important.\n\nDA: What was it like leaving Wall Street to invest in African startups?\n\nZG: Venture capital is very similar to investment banking. In investment banking you\u2019re investing in listed companies while in venture capital you\u2019re dealing with unlisted companies. I found that the skills I learned in investment banking can be applied to startups. For instance, while in investment banking, you do a lot of analysis around profitability ratios, revenue growth ratios and leverage margins, in the startup world you analyse a different set of metrics. For startups, unit economics are a lot more important than balance sheet numbers. In unit economics you\u2019re looking at the lifetime value of a customer or the cost of acquiring a customer. Here it\u2019s not just your EBITDA margins, but how your EBITDA margins change over a period of time. You look at growth versus churn, you look at your virality coefficient, which is basically about how many other customers are referred from customers onboarded. Unlike in investment banking, startups don\u2019t have much data, so the ability to work with small sets of data is something that VCs really need to get.\n\nDA: What is your ticket size? What do you look for in startups you invest in?\n\nZG: On average we invest between $100,000\u2013$300,000 in a company. The typical sort of traction we need to see in companies is, they must be doing at least $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR). So if you\u2019re a startup with just an idea and you\u2019re just doing $5,000 in revenue a month, we\u2019re not interested. We do make exceptions if your intellectual property is really good, or you\u2019re in a very niche market, but, generally speaking, at least $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue.\n\nTypically, you should have a business-to-business (B2B) business model, so you should be working either with banks, insurers, telcos, or retailers. Business-to-consumer (B2C) is very tough to scale at the early stage. And, typically, we can value a company anywhere between 5\u201310 times their annual recurring revenue. In certain cases, we can do more than 10 times revenue as a valuation benchmark. We invest mostly through SAFEs\u2014Simple agreements for future equity. We don\u2019t do convertible notes or equity unless there\u2019s no other option. On a lot of these deals, we get our Limited Partners (LPs) to co-invest with us. We\u2019ve got more than 150 LPs in our fund and they can write small cheques of $25,000 to $3 million. The fact that our LPS can invest alongside gives us a lot more leverage than just us having our own capital to invest.\n\nDA: Why the preference for investing through SAFEs?\n\nZG: SAFEs are very easy to execute. They are standard. We don\u2019t do any SAFEs that are uncapped, so all our SAFEs are capped, so we know exactly what sort of conversion there would be. We don\u2019t do uncapped SAFEs because we don\u2019t like the drag-along or tag-along of equity clawback provisions and participation rights to board seats. All of that typically gets discussed at Series A. So, with SAFEs, we agree to a cap or discount and the amount that we\u2019re investing. When you are big enough and have enough traction to do a later-stage round, our safe notice converts into whatever your next price round is. It defers the valuation to later so it\u2019s a lot easier to execute versus having to argue about price and terms, etc. It\u2019s just more comfortable and convenient, plus the legal costs are zero.\n\nAlso, the duration of our fund is only 7 years so the reason why we can do that is because a lot of our exits come from secondaries. So when these companies are raising future rounds of funding, and there\u2019s more capital coming in from institutional investors and series A and Series B, we will typically sell a small portion of our stake so we can get our capital back through secondaries. We don\u2019t have to wait until an IPO or an Mergers & Acquisitions event to realise money.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve shared what you looked for in startups in terms of performance. Are there other attributes you look out for in founders or startups before investing?\n\nZG: We look for strong founders. Repeat founders are rare to find, but repeat founders, if we get them, are good because at least they have experience of doing something similar in the past, and, often, failing is not a negative thing. Failing means that at least you\u2019ve learnt something from your past experience that prepares you for the future. We look for founders that have the confidence and know the industry really well\u2014so founders that know their market, and understand margins and competitive pricing. Founders that have very good relationships with big corporations are important. So, if you\u2019re in Nigeria, for example, and you\u2019re a fintech, we\u2019d like to know founders who have relationships with all the big banks and possibly the regulator, the Central Bank of Nigeria. We don\u2019t invest in founders that talk a lot and are super arrogant. There are plenty of founders like that.\n\nWe look for a strong product-market fit. We typically talk to 2 or 3 of the company\u2019s leading clients, so we always cross reference productions we do to clients.\n\nWe look at the total addressable market and the track record. Also, in our case, because we are a big pan-African fund we look for synergies and linkages within our portfolio. We really need to see how our portfolio companies can benefit. For example, a payments company, an insurance company, or a logistics company. The presence of synergies within our portfolio makes the investment case even more lucrative from our side.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 90 startups within 18 months, that\u2019s faster than most VC firms. Why?\n\nZG: I think we move that fast because when you\u2019re at the seed stage, and you\u2019re raising like a million dollars in the seed round, you don\u2019t have 6 months to wait for VCs to make a decision.\n\nThe legal and tech due diligence (DD), to a large extent, are taken away because the companies come through an accelerator, so the tech is usually with AWS and Google. The legalities are sorted because the IPs are in Delaware or the UK. So we spend most of our time on market analysis, examining the founders, doing human due diligence, for lack of a better word.\n\nYou look at the team and look at the product, you make a few calls with the clients and you look at the unit economics. We look at the LTV to CAC multiples, we look at the partnerships that they have with corporations, especially proof of concepts and pilots. We speak to some of their clients and consumers and that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re spending more than 6 to 8 weeks in DD for a pre-seed company, it\u2019s inefficient. Once you get to Series A then you do a lot more DD.\n\nPrior to us, there weren\u2019t really specific specialist seed funds for Africa. Nowadays there are funds like us and there\u2019s Future Africa. When we started the fund in September 2020, we set out to raise $15 million. And then midway through last year, we realised that there\u2019s just way too much demand for capital and also way too much interest from Limited Partners to get involved much earlier. So we increased our fund size to $30 million.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve invested just under $18 million dollars. We can invest a further sort of 5 to $6 million over the next 5 months and our fund will be fully invested by May, June. Then over the next five years, we\u2019ll just be harvesting these companies\u2014looking for exits, portfolio synergies and partnerships. And in parallel by early next year, we will raise a much bigger fund which would be focused on seed, series A and Series B. That fund size will be targeting between $250-300 million. Our goal is to become the sequoia of Africa.\n\nDA: I noticed you have a small team and a large number of advisers. Tell me about your team structure?\n\nZG: We\u2019re a very small team of 8 full-time people. So we have advisors because we have many portfolio companies. It\u2019s important to note that the advisors don\u2019t work for us, they work for our portfolio companies. These advisors are basically people that are experts in a product or a sector or region. For example, it could be a Nigerian fintech expert or an East Africa logistics expert. That person will directly advise our portfolio companies, and their compensation will either be some sort of a consulting revenue from the startup or what\u2019s more common is they get advisory equity in the portfolio company, so we are able to leverage their expertise.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nZG: It\u2019s so many different things. First we get lots of inbound interest from founders, our team is constantly looking at founders and companies to evaluate so we do lots of initial calls with founders. I\u2019m also constantly talking to my current LPs about helping portfolio companies or new investment opportunities and to new potential LPs.\n\nOur current portfolio companies also always have requests related to hiring, partnering with other tech companies or expanding to different markets. We have 85 companies and over 150 investors, so there\u2019s a lot to do.\n\nDA: What are some key trends you see in the market?\n\nZG: I think the market is going to be very active. I made a recent LinkedIn post which has over 30,000 views. Africa accounts for about 17.5\u201318% of the world\u2019s population and about 2.73% of its GDP, but less than 1% of venture capital. So there\u2019s a lot of catching up that needs to be done.\n\nEven though we had a record-breaking year last year, there\u2019s still a lot more that needs to be done from an investment perspective.\n\nI\u2019m very bullish, there\u2019s going to be a lot more money I think coming into earlier stages, which is seed and Series A. And we\u2019re going to have a lot more types of firms getting involved. There\u2019s going to be more angel investing, even though we\u2019re coming out of a tough year. With low interest rates in the US and Europe, there isn\u2019t much of a channel for planning. So low interest rates are great from a financing perspective for founders, especially if you\u2019re looking at debt financing but from an investment return perspective. I know people are saying that they\u2019re going to raise rates in the US this year. But honestly, the trickle down into African VC is going to be so minor so I wouldn\u2019t really worry too much about the effective interest rates going up. I\u2019m very bullish on the amount of capital coming into Africa in the next two or three years.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication between a business and its customers is essential for business survival. From customer onboarding to retention, a company\u2019s ability to communicate clearly, effectively, and swiftly could be the difference between its growth and decline and consequent death.\n\nIronically, communication aids business growth and, if done correctly, ensures there are more people to relate with, increasing the communication burden.\n\nPeople communicate differently and have preferred modes of communication. It, therefore, behoves a business to understand every customers\u2019 preference and reach them through it.\n\nA daunting task, but one startup wants to make it easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSendchamp is a software company on a mission to help businesses improve customer relations by reducing the technicalities involved. The startup was founded by Goodness Kayode (CEO) and Damilola Olotu (CTO) after realising how confusing the customer management process was in the companies where they had worked.\n\nKayode started noticing the loopholes in customer management platforms when he consulted for a fintech company to create an onboarding communication process. He had to combine tools like Mailchimp, GetGist and HelpCrunch because they each only provided one mode of communication, which meant more spending on customer communication.\n\nWhile these platforms could help businesses communicate with customers effectively, there were still significant setbacks, their lack of versatility being one of the major ones.\n\nAccording to Kayode, a business communicates in three stages: the first gets customers on board while the second and third support and retain them, respectively.\n\nThe lack of versatility means that these platforms could only do one of the three, which means businesses have to use different platforms at every point in time \u2014 a costly process. For example, some platforms only offer emailing services, while others are great for live chats.\n\nSendchamp, however, wants to combine all these services into one \u2014 a unified message delivery platform or multichannel communication tool that allows users to deliver messages across multiple channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, Email, and voice.\n\nIt also offers a customer relations management (CRM) platform solution that allows technical and non-technical people to manage customer relations effectively.\n\nThese solutions already exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendchamp Co-Founders, (L-R) Goodness Kayode and Damilola Olotu\n\nFor anyone new to the customer relations and communication scene, the solutions Sendchamp is offering might seem new, but they already exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his conversation with Techpoint Africa, Kayode noted that while unified message delivery platforms like Sendchamp exist, they were out of the reach of African businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a global solution provider that is ready to provide this, but how do we pay them? With card limits and high exchange rates, it becomes challenging to use these existing platforms.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the payment issues, some of them can only be used by technical business owners, leaving out those who do not have technical backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe are building a simple multichannel communication tool that allows businesses to onboard, engage, retain, or support customers from just one place. We are also focusing on non-technical people in marketing and sales,\u201d Kayode said.\n\nHaving consulted for several companies, he has concluded that customers like flexibility when communicating with a business.\n\n\u201cCustomers do not want to be restricted; they want the flexibility to reach out to businesses via different channels, be it WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, or even SMS. For example, if you send an email to someone that\u2019s into agent banking, you might not get engagements, but if you reached out to them via SMS, you\u2019d likely get responses because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Sendchamp raised $100,000 in an angel round in December 2021. So far, it has helped businesses using its platform reach 300,000 customers and delivered three million messages.\n\nWhile only present in Nigeria, Kayode said users from Kenya have begun to show an interest in using the platform. Although Sendchamp does not have local integration in Kenya and other African countries, businesses there can still use the platform, albeit with limited functionality.\n\nHandling privacy issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendchamp website\n\n\u201cTo make money as a business, you have to reach out to customers; it is the ABC of every business,\u201d Kayode said.\n\nHe cited an example of Computer Village, Lagos and how businessmen and women called out to passers-by trying to communicate what they sell and the services they offer.\n\nUsing the same example, he pointed out that communication doesn\u2019t end at just getting the customer to buy, as retaining a customer is as crucial as getting a customer.\n\n\u201cSo the reason why a customer is going to remember that you exist is communication.\u201d\n\nWith so much communication to be done, how does Sendchamp handle privacy?\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we use Enterprise Grid systems to prevent a data breach. It secures information transferred between customers and businesses.\u201d\n\nEnterprise Grid is a solution created by American communication company, Slack. It includes security and governance functionalities that help secure communication within an enterprise.\n\nIn addition to security features such as Enterprise Grid, Kayode said there are terms of use that ensure no data is sold or linked to any dataset.\n\nGlobally, the unified communications market was worth $78.33 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $344.84 billion by 2028. Sendchamp wants to be a significant part of that market as Kayode believes that every business in Africa will use Sendchamp to boost customer relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

It appears Ghanaians can now travel through 44,000 airports, using their National ID cards \u2014 Ghana Card \u2014 as an e-passport.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, though. Some people seem to have mistaken \u201ctravel through\u201d to mean \u201ctravel to\u201d. But as The United Nations\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \u2014 the body said to have given the go-ahead \u2014 said on Friday, February 11, 2022, the latter is most definitely not the case.\n\nAccording to the ICAO, it doesn\u2019t have the authority to \u201ccertify the use of a State\u2019s Identity Card for international travel in place of a passport.\u201d Essentially, all states have the sovereign power to decide how you enter and exit their borders. In this case, instead of using their passports, Ghanaians can enter Ghana using their National ID card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe West African nation appears to be on a digital identity campaign. Remember this: Ghanaians to begin re-registration of SIM cards with Ghana Card or risk getting their SIMs blocked\n\nI have one question, though. Can\u2019t Nigerian leaders see that we are literally this close to losing the Nigeria-Ghana Jollof wars?\n\nAway from that, it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s day! And I \u2014 more like Oluwanifemi \u2014 have something for the lovers (if we don\u2019t get nuked by Putin\u2019s Russia).\n\nFor the rest of us singles, we\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe arduous task of accessible healthcare in Africa, and\n\nThe art of communicating with customers\n\nWeb3, but for love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last few years, every Valentine\u2019s day, social media has been filled with images of flowery messages sent to lovers, romantic getaways to Dubai or the Maldives and sometimes, surprise marriage proposals.\n\nBut in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic stormed the world, giving most lovers the unique long-distance relationship experience. People have had to rethink their romantic plans for Valentine\u2019s. Planning a trip around Europe? COVID. Want to go out on a date? COVID.\n\nWith the pandemic, however, new ways to create romantic moments meant lots of digital interaction: Zoom dates, virtual movie nights, and even online tours with the Airbnb experience \u2014 with social distancing, of course.\n\nNow, with the Web3 and metaverse craze gaining momentum, it appears that we most definitely haven\u2019t seen the end of digital romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould you enjoy going on a date in the metaverse? Or getting a token named after you as a Valentine\u2019s gift? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like the last one, though. But, Oluwanifemi has curated some romantic gift ideas for you, Web3 style. Don\u2019t forget to check them out later today.\n\nP.S. Rumor has it that couples are likely to break up on Valentine\u2019s day. You never know if you are giving the wrong gifts. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAccessible healthcare for Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nDon\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m not too fond of hospitals. Today I Iearnt something new which I\u2019m about to share with you guys: the difference between primary and secondary healthcare.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, \u201cPHC (primary healthcare) is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people\u2019s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people\u2019s everyday environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pallipedia, secondary healthcare, on the other hand, refers to \u201cHospitals and outpatient specialist clinics to which people go, after referral from primary health care services. These services are generally more specialised and further from where people live.\u201d\n\nSo, primary healthcare basically refers to essential health care that should be made accessible to everyone. It\u2019s very grassroots and community-based and focuses on the equitable and cost-effective distribution of health services and the prevention of illnesses.\n\nSecondary healthcare is more complicated than that and would involve \u201cmore\u201d serious diseases or conditions. Here you\u2019ll find operating theatres, radiotherapy, pathology labs, and so on.\n\nIn Africa, however, access to primary healthcare is hampered by low budgeting, little staffing, and sometimes bureaucratic bottlenecks.\n\nSome African entrepreneurs are trying to bridge this gap, and we\u2019ve seen startups like RelianceHMO, Wellahealth, DabaDoc, and Dokitar spring up.\n\nChimgozirim had a chat with Njabulo Skhosana, founder of South African healthtech startup, Healthdart, to understand how it hopes to make primary healthcare accessible to Africans. This is another story to look forward to today.\n\nCommunicating with your customers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from being in it to make a profit, businesses are run to serve their customers. We tend to repeat the phrase, \u201cthe customer is always right,\u201d or \u201cthe customer is king\u201d because we know how important they are to the business\u2019s success.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing that usually appears to be a stumbling block in the business-customer relationship, communication. Business owners need to be careful how they pass across information to their customers. But more than this, there\u2019s also the issue of different communication channels.\n\nSome people prefer to send/receive emails, while some would instead send text messages. Others would rather communicate via Instagram Direct Messages. How do you cater to this fragmented list?\n\nWell, Nigeria-based Sendchamp is creating a unified message delivery platform that allows businesses to communicate to customers across multiple channels.\n\nBolu spoke with Goodness Kayode, CEO of Sendchamp, to learn more about how the company intends to play in the over $78 billion unified communications market. Another story you can look forward to today.\n\nLast week on Techpoint\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThis week is productive!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking physical time for love and intimacy can be challenging, especially when we are distracted by the things that place a demand on our time. And the many options that come with alternative connections through social networking platforms and other tech don\u2019t make it any easier; if anything, they blur the line between the real and the unreal.\n\nWhat do you do when Valentine\u2019s Day is around the corner, and you want to get your love a gift they will appreciate, but you can\u2019t ask them since that will ruin the surprise? Or you\u2019re miles away from the love of your life, and the best you could manage is a virtual call, but you craved for more?\n\nThe only sane options would be to engage the services of your lover\u2019s friends and acquaintances or wait till the next time you can see the love of your life.\n\nNow imagine a future where all these become less of an option because several innovations finding solutions to real-life problems are coming at us fast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some ideas you could consider to have a swell Valentine\u2019s Day while we await those days.\n\nGifting non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent forms of Valentine\u2019s Day packages have been in our faces since the year began. These bundled packages come at outrageous prices, often more expensive than the total cost of the individual items.\n\nBeyond this craze, you could consider getting your loved ones NFTs. But I would only recommend this if you\u2019re both blockchain enthusiasts \u2014 this is an important condition that would not ruin what should be a romantic gesture.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to paint a picture of my reaction if I got an NFT as a birthday or Valentine\u2019s present, but I\u2019ll pass. After all, this isn\u2019t about me. So, let\u2019s move on.\n\nWhat if you get a personalised NFT in the form of an exquisite illustration with an inscription of your lover\u2019s name from Anthony Azekwoh? How about joining the whitelist for one of Gustav Klimt\u2019s \u2018The Kiss\u2019 digital masterpieces. Interestingly, gifting NFTs will happen sooner than later because several NFT marketplaces are now available.\n\nMeanwhile, NFT is not such a complex concept, get to know more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR, like several other emerging technologies, has great potential to blur the lines between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s virtual and, to a large extent, take away the barriers to intimacy. Some companies in the hospitality sector already provide dining experiences in VR, but they cost a lot.\n\nImagine a dinner date at one of your favourite restaurants, complete with all the glam and glimmer. After a two-course meal and a few drinks, you two cuddle up on a sofa, ready to watch your favourite love movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo scenarios can play out here.\n\nYou eat and drink across each other at a table and later get into the immersive world of a movie where you both can create your adventures while holding hands.\n\nBut what if neither of you is physically present on that date?\n\nYou could book a virtual date at a luxury hot spot anywhere in the world, where all you have to do is either wear VR gear or, for a more immersive experience, use a full-scale VR room at different locations. With this, every gesture in real life is translated into your action in that virtual world, and you get to feel everything.\n\nIs this something you\u2019d love to try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaverse Magna\n\nWhat\u2019s the buzzword? Metaverse. Although the concept is yet to take form, having a dinner date in the metaverse is not hard to imagine. Of course, it goes beyond having screen time with the love of your life or the regular 3D immersive world that VR offers. It is on a more advanced level.\n\nWhat do you think of having your digital avatar living a separate life in a different realm, booking a dinner date, paying for it, and having it customised to your taste? Yes, my plan is for your imagination to run wild. Go for it!\n\nDrone gift delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you intend to spend your Valentine\u2019s Day? If one of your plans is to send gifts to a loved one, top of your worries is probably getting a reliable delivery service to deliver your flowers, stuffed bears, or food trays. Next is hoping your gifts arrive in one piece.\n\nWith the bad experiences associated with on-demand dispatch riders and delivery services, drone delivery should be considered. This is a common option in Africa\u2019s logistics space, particularly in healthcare, where there are a few use cases like drug delivery.\n\nDrone delivery offers speed because traffic congestion and inaccessible roads don\u2019t pose problems. However, there is a high possibility of theft as drones can be hacked and hijacked.\n\nWould you consider this option if it were available on your online shopping platform?\n\nAI shopping assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Andrea De Santis on Unsplash\n\n\u201cHey, Google, what do I get for my boyfriend for Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\n\nAs I thought, my google assistant led me to a search page with a sea of generic \u2018what to gets\u2019, which didn\u2019t help much because I still had to go through them to decide what fits.\n\nWhat if there were an AI assistant that crawls your lovers\u2019 Internet footprints \u2014 including google searches and social media activities \u2014 and text messages with their consent to inform suggestions on what to get? With all the data at its disposal, you can be sure to get close to perfect guesses.\n\nNot only that, but the assistant will also search the Internet for merchants that will have the product available at the least possible price. Think Honey or AliExpress shopping assistant, AliHelper.\n\nThinking about it now, a lot of privacy concerns will definitely arise from this especially when it\u2019s done without the other person\u2019s consent to preserve the surprise. But what do they say, \u201cAll is fair in love and war.\u201d Isn\u2019t it?\n\nContemplate for a minute, or two, how addictive love tech innovations can become. Could they replace the need for physical human interaction? As with all things new, especially tech, the possibilities are endless. However, only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Also refer Common WordPress Errors for the most common WordPress errors experienced by WordPress users such as\n\nThe White Screen\n\nInternal Server Error\n\nError Establishing Database Connection\n\nFailed Auto-Upgrade\n\nConnection Timed Out\n\nMaintenance Mode Following Upgrade\n\nPHP errors or MySQL DB errors\n\nHow to deactivate all plugins when not able to access the administrative menus? # How to deactivate all plugins when not able to access the administrative menus?\n\nSometimes it may be necessary to deactivate all plugins, but you can\u2019t access the Administration Screens to do so. One of two methods are available to deactivate all plugins.\n\nUse phpMyAdmin to deactivate all plugins.\n\nIn the table wp_options, under the option_name column (field) find the active_plugins row Change the option_value field to: a:0:{}\n\nOr reset your plugins folder via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.\n\nVia FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory) Via FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, rename the folder \u201cplugins\u201d to \u201cplugins.hold\u201d Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) \u2013 this will disable any plugin that is \u201cmissing\u201d. Via FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, rename \u201cplugins.hold\u201d back to \u201cplugins\u201d\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow to clear the \u201cBriefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance\u201d message after doing automatic upgrade? # How to clear the \u201cBriefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance\u201d message after doing automatic upgrade?\n\nAs part of the automatic upgrade WordPress places a file named .maintenance in the blog base folder (folder that contains the wp-admin folder). If that file exists, then vistors will see the message Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.\n\nTo stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the .maintenance file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhen an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now. Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won\u2019t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.\n\nIf you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the update_core option name record in your wp_options table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records update_plugins and update_themes, in wp_options.\n\nRelevant discussion thread:\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade? # Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?\n\nA core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.\n\nPlease note, a core upgrade goes through a list of \u201cold files\u201d, as defined in wp-admin/includes/update-core.php, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.\n\nRemember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in WordPress Backups.\n\nA better way to modify the default theme is by using a child theme. It\u2019s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do you repair a MySQL database table? # How do you repair a MySQL database table?\n\nEvery once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as \u201ctbl_name.frm is locked against change\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t find file tbl_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)\u201d, \u201cUnexpected end of file\u201d, \u201cRecord file is crashed\u201d, or \u201cGot error nnn from table handler\u201d.\n\nHere are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin:\n\nLogin to hosting account. Login to phpMyAdmin. Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you don\u2019t need to do anything. In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair. At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose \u201cRepair Table\u201d\n\nRemember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times. See also WordPress Backups\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I empty a database table? # How do I empty a database table?\n\nRefer Emptying a Database Table\n\nTop \u2191\n\nEmailed passwords are not being received # Emailed passwords are not being received\n\nDescription: When users try to register with your blog or change their passwords by entering their username and/or email, WordPress indicates that their password has been emailed to them, but it is never received.\n\nReason and Solutions: WordPress uses the standard PHP mail() function, which uses sendmail. No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to\u2019s). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your *NIX box you may find msmtp useful \u2014 it provides \u201cA secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub\u201d. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like Glob SendMail.\n\nMore help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24981.\n\nWindows Host Server Specific: Check your \u201cRelay\u201d settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to 127.0.0.1 . Then in your php.inifile, set the SMTP setting to the same IP address. Also set smtp_port to 25 .\n\nEnsure Proper Return Address is Used: By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with wordpress@yourdomain.com and the From: name as WordPress.\n\nThis is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is wordpress@yourdomain.com, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as yourdomain.com is setup to send and receive mail, even if wordpress is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it\u2019s something like wpgod@gmail.com, the mail may not send because gmail.com is not a domain handled by the mail server.\n\nTreated as Spam: Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient\u2019s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.\n\nSPF: (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.\n\nIf your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server\u2019s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.\n\nDKIM: (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host\u2019s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria? # Why can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria?\n\nClearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also I Make Changes and Nothing Happens\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem? # How do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem?\n\nDescription: You get a warning message on your browser that says:\n\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at\n\nReason and Solution:\n\nIt is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening <?php tag or after a closing ?> tag, typically in wp-config.php. This could be true about some other file too, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see \u201cInterpreting the Error Message\u201d below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.\n\nJust because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.\n\nDownload the file mentioned in the error message via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. Open that file in a plain text editor (NOT Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine). Check that the very first characters are with no blank lines or spaces after it. Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not UTF-8 BOM but plain UTF-8 or any without the BOM suffix.\n\nTo be sure about the end of the file, do this:\n\nPlace the cursor between the ? and > Now press the DELETE key on your computer Note to MAC users: The \u201cDELETE\u201d key on a PC deletes characters to the right of the cursor. That is the key noted here. Keep that key pressed For at least 15 seconds Now type > and save without pressing any other key at all. If you press another key, you will bring the problem back. DO NOT PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.\n\nWrong:\n\n<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?>\n\nCorrect:\n\n<?php code; some other code; ?>\n\nUpload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.\n\nNote: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.\n\nInterpreting the Error Message:\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42 , then the problem is at line #34 of wp-config.php , not line #42 of wp-login.php . In this scenario, line #42 of wp-login.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of wp-config.php .\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569 , then the problem is at line #8 of admin-header.php , not line #569 of post.php . In this scenario, line #569 of post.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of admin-header.php .\n\nTop \u2191\n\nTo resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).\n\nIn addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser\u2019s cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nIf an error 404 occurs when using the Pretty Permalink choices such as Day and Name in Administration > Settings > Settings_Permalinks_Screen it could be a result of the mod_rewrite module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate mod_rewrite for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line # LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nand delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. Note: you may have to ask your host to activate mod_rewrite.\n\nSee also Using Permalinks.

          "text": "The cost of transporting containers from Apapa and Tin-Can Island ports, the two main seaports in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, has improved in the last year after the introduction of the electronic call-up system, and businesses are the better for it.\n\nThe E call-up system, targeted at managing truck traffic into the Apapa Port, has not only helped to reduce congestion within the port city but has also improved travel time for port users, motorists and residents.\n\nBala Mohammed, a truck owner, who described the call-up system as the best solution to traffic management in Apapa and Tin-Can ports, states that there has been a significant improvement in traffic as trucks no longer clog the bridges, adjourning streets and port access roads.\n\nAccording to Mohammed, it now takes two to three days for trucks to access the port from pre-gate or satellite parks compared to the days when trucks will take three weeks or one month to get to the port.\n\n\u201cEto (the E call-up system) has assisted truckers in bringing down the cost of accessing the port. Before, truckers spend between N250,000 and N300,000 to get to the port, but now we spend no more than N30,000 to get to the port,\u201d he told BusinessDay in a telephone interview.\n\nThe E call-up has also helped in bringing down haulage cost, which was formerly between N600,000 and N650,000 to load Apapa to Ikeja, or N1 million to N1.1 million to load Tin-Can to Ikeja, but now, Ikeja from Apapa costs between N140,000 and N200,000 while from Tin-Can it is within the range of N160,000 and N200,000, he said.\n\nCurrently, importers pay between N370,000 and N400,000 to move one by 40-foot container from Apapa to warehouses in Ikeja, Lagos, while one by 20-foot container costs about N300,000.\n\nFrom Tin-Can Port, importers still pay between N700,000 to move one by 40-foot container to the same Ikeja while one by 20-foot costs between N350,000 and N400,000 due to problems associated with return of empty containers.\n\nThe reduced traffic congestion and haulage cost are a boon for businesses operating within Apapa, whose profits took a haircut in the back due to the unforgiving gridlock.\n\nFor instance, NASCON, a consumer goods company, moved 60 percent of its operations away from Apapa in 2019 after the gridlock affected the movement of raw materials, timely delivery of finished goods to customers and increased turn-around time of the company\u2019s trucks.\n\nRemi Ogungbemi, chairman, Association of Maritime Truck Owners (AMATO), said though the call-up system is helping to address the traffic congestion in Apapa, it has also not performed optimally.\n\nAccording to Ogungbemi, trucks that normally queue from Apapa to Mushin and Palmgrove before the call-up system no longer queue like that again.\n\nThe amount truckers spend to access the port has also reduced drastically, but extortion by the enforcement team remains because there are areas where police still pass trucks in place of the system, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy things have not been working as expected is because people that have been benefiting from the chaos still want to be benefiting. This is why they are still looking for how to circumvent and sabotage the system. Whether anybody likes it or not, an automation system for admitting trucks into the port called Eto has come to stay and we can only improve on it,\u201d Ogungbemi assured.\n\nThe system does not favour those charging truckers between N100,000 and N200,000 to pass trucks into the port, and such people are no longer getting such monies again, he noted.\n\nWhile pointing out that truckers still see policemen, LASTMA officials, and Road Safety on the road when it is not supposed to be, he said truckers want the system to work in a way that trucks will remain in their private parks till they receive information that it is their turn to load before they can leave their parks.\n\nOn challenges, Eto is still releasing trucks more than necessary, he said, adding that truckers want a situation where trucks would be released according to what each terminal can accommodate at a point in time.\n\nRead also:\n\nReleasing 500 trucks because a terminal can attend to 500 trucks in a day is not the best, rather the number can be rationed, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cA situation where we are still having human interference is not the best. It is because the system has not been working as expected. If it has worked as expected, we will not need anybody to stand on the road. Eto system is far better than where we are coming from and we are hoping that it gets to a point where the system will work optimally,\u201d he said.\n\nOn some of the challenges facing the system, Mohammed said the existence of multiple checkpoints mounted by the enforcement teams including LASTMA, police, FRSC, and NPA security for extortion is affecting the effectiveness of the system.\n\n\u201cNo system is perfect at a go. When the truck leaves the satellite parks or pre-gates to the port, it is supposed to move smoothly but because of extortion, we still see multiple checkpoints. This is affecting the smooth batching of trucks to the port. We need the checkpoints to be reduced in order to enhance the batching of trucks into the ports because the system does not need human interference,\u201d he said.",

When the truck leaves the satellite parks or pre-gates to the port, it is supposed to move smoothly but because of extortion, we still see multiple checkpoints. This is affecting the smooth batching of trucks to the port. We need the checkpoints to be reduced in order to enhance the batching of trucks into the ports because the system does not need human interference,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "The cost of transporting containers from Apapa and Tin-Can Island ports, the two main seaports in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, has improved in the last year after the introduction of the electronic call-up system, and businesses are the better for it.\nThe E call-up system, targeted at managing truck traffic into the Apapa Port, has not only helped to reduce congestion within the port city but has also improved travel time for port users, motorists and residents.\n\u201cEto (the E call-up system) has assisted truckers in bringing down the cost of accessing the port.\nRemi Ogungbemi, chairman, Association of Maritime Truck Owners (AMATO), said though the call-up system is helping to address the traffic congestion in Apapa, it has also not performed optimally.\nAccording to Ogungbemi, trucks that normally queue from Apapa to Mushin and Palmgrove before the call-up system no longer queue like that again.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged stakeholders in the healthcare sector to be accountable and transparent in delivering quality healthcare services to members of the public.\n\nThe governor made the call during a 3-day Edo Health Sector Strategy Retreat, with the theme, \u201cTransforming the Health Ecosystem in Edo State to Achieve Resilience and Quality Healthcare.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, everybody in this retreat has committed themselves to the citizens. We must make sure that the design of the system is transparent and open and everybody must be accountable.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation where someone dies in a clinic or hospital and nobody comes to ask how? Why did this person die? Was it due to negligence? Was he or she given proper and adequate care.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be held accountable. Fine, if it is of natural causes, let us know. Let the third-party check and see if it\u2019s true, so that people are held accountable for what they do. Every human life is precious, very precious and even the lives of Edo people are even more precious,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki said, \u201cAt the end of this retreat, I want to be able to clearly tell as a regulator of the healthcare system, what exactly and how we are going to undertake these regulatory functions in the the next one year in particular. Regulations is not about you paying money, it\u2019s not about revenue.\n\n\u201cRegulations are about quality of service because the activities you undertake affect somebody\u2019s live. Once you provide the right services, money will come. So don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about revenue. Your primary responsibility is to provide quality care.\n\n\u201cThis whole idea of double dipping can\u2019t work again. If you want to work as an operator in my own healthcare system, then you cannot be working on your own at the same time and double dipping. If that is going to happen, we must have an agreement where there is transparency. You can\u2019t be referring patients that come to my care to your centres.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, moving drugs and service equipment that I have provided for your own private use is not fair. It is not right. If you are going to admit them in my facilities, let us have an agreement. We need to talk through how we make sure that we contribute enough to sustaining our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cAs far as I am concerned, my goal is to improve the healthcare system. Government has a responsibility to provide healthcare. At a certain level, the government is also a regulator and we must understand those two roles clearly. As the regulator, everybody that is providing health care services in Edo has to be regulated by the state government, whether you are federal government, private or international agency, the law says we must regulate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be part of this retreat so that together we can all agree on the way forward. I know that it would work. I have worked with some of you. I don\u2019t want any of you to travel again. I know some of you are in high demand globally. We want to make you stay back at home so that we can provide care for our people,\u201d he noted.\n\nIn her remarks, Edo State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Obehi Akoria, reiterated the governor\u2019s determination to provide quality healthcare at all levels through the Edo State Health Insurance Scheme to enable a shift from out-of-pocket spending.\n\nProf. Akoria noted that plans are on to make Edo a regional reference point for quality healthcare delivery and desired destination for health innovations.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

There is a whole generation who are not privileged as some of those you are teaching now to receive the kind of quality education you are impacting on the children under your care. What do we do about adult education?\n\n\u201cIs it possible to bring them back to evening or weekend classes so that we can train them? Considering the role of adult education, should we just leave them like that?\u201d He queried.\n\nOn strengthening security in schools, Obaseki stated, \u201cIt is only a good parent and teacher that will be concerned about the security of students in schools.\n\n\u201cThose are the issues that are bothering us now. So, we are going to try to do as much as we can under our school improvement programmes to fence as many of our schools and those ones that we can\u2019t fence, we will not only use the constabularies, we will now include the vigilantes to help secure the schools.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who noted that his administration has recorded significant progress in the education sector in the past five years said, \u201cYou cannot imagine how happy I am because when I cast my mind back to four, five years ago, this is not the kind of reception I normally have with members of trade unions. For me, we have made a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cToday, we understand each other; we are on the same page, we are now partners. We are all striving to achieve the same goals. I am so glad that our conversation today is not about salary payments, pension for your retired colleagues, or leave allowance.\n\n\u201cWe have streamlined all of these; we are now talking about the children under your care. What more can a leader ask for? I now see you as my real partners and therefore, I will treat you as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner for Education is organizing a series of workshops to bring all of us together to discuss the future of our education. Our priority as a state is education, because that\u2019s the foundation that everything else rests on,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\n\u201cWe are working things out to make sure that we start a lot of renovations and improvements of our schools,\u201d he assured.\n\nEarlier, the state Chairman of NUT, Mr. Bernard Ajobiewe, commended the governor for prompt payment of salaries to all the workers in the state\u2019s civil and public service, urging increased partnership between the government and teachers to guarantee the provision of quality education to students in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has declared suspended head of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), DCP Abba Kyari, wanted over links with an international drug cartel.\n\nThis was made known by the spokesperson for the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, during a press briefing held at the agency\u2019s headquarters.\n\nKyari was also last year, declared wanted by the United States authorities over alleged links with international fraudster, Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi.\n\nMr. Babafemi, in the press conference, on Monday, regretted that drug problem in Nigeria was enormous, emphasising the need for all well-meaning Nigerians to play a positive role in curbing the illicit drug menace.\n\n\u201cEven before the damning findings of the 2018 National Drug Use and Health Survey, Nigeria\u2019s drug problem was getting close to epidemic proportion.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if anything, the arrests and seizures by NDLEA in the past 12 months is an indication that the country\u2019s drug problem was grossly underestimated before President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s resolve to strengthen the NDLEA and the subsequent launch of offensive action by the Agency to clean the society of the menace.\n\n\u201cAnd in just 12 months, even the most cynical of Nigerians now agree that the country is really in a drug quagmire and therefore appreciates the relentless efforts of NDLEA operatives.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some law enforcement agents who should be partners in the pursuit of the President\u2019s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law, as they aid and abet drug trafficking in the country.\n\n\u201cToday, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal, the Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the Agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\n\n\u201cLet me give a synopsis of what transpired.\n\n\u201cThe saga started on Friday, January 21, 2022, when DCP Kyari initiated a call to one of the NDLEA officers in Abuja at 2:12 pm. When the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine.\n\n\u201cHe proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\n\u201cNow, anybody who is in touch with the reality of the renewed drug war by NDLEA since January 18, 2021, would know that that was a tall order because our officers and men have rededicated themselves to the war against illicit drugs and what Kyari was asking for was not tenable, not in this new dispensation, not with the new NDLEA. We can recall that one of our officers was in the same situation in May 2021 when a drug kingpin, Ejiofor Felix Enwereaku, flew from Brazil to Nigeria to negotiate the release of a 27.95 kg shipment of cocaine intercepted at the MMIA.\n\n\u201cThe drug lord offered a bribe of $24, 500, but our officer placed duty above pecuniary interest. We all know how the episode ended. That is the ethos of the new NDLEA. And our officer proved it again this time by reporting to the authorities.\n\n\u201cBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the Agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and he and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold.\n\n\u201cHe then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg.\n\n\u201cAt N7m per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35m, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team.\n\n\u201cHe put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\n\u201cThe next day January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnd by 5: 23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting.\n\n\u201cIn their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61, 400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders. And the moment was documented, part of which I will play for you at the end of this briefing.\n\n\u201cSo we have a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video and a detailed transcript of the communication between him and the NDLEA officer.\n\n\u201cThis is not the place to delve into the details. But it is disheartening to hear straight from the horse\u2019s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: \u201cthe boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening to hear him say of this rogue team, and I quote: \u201cI do take good care of them, and this kind of work is done by only that team.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally disheartening to hear him give details of another similar operation which they pulled off, three weeks ago, according to him.\n\n\u201cWell, I am not here to wash his dirty linen in the public. But I want us to understand how we arrive at this juncture whereby we are having this press briefing.\n\n\u201cNDLEA has the mandate to take custody of suspects and consignments of drugs seized by other arms of law enforcement. And there is a standard protocol for such transfer. This we duly followed. The suspects and drugs were delivered to us on February 8 but the last part of the process, yet to be completed, is the debriefing of Kyari.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, DCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded.\n\n\u201cWe are a law-abiding agency of government. We follow due process. In that vein, we will not detain suspects beyond the stipulated period according to the law before we charge them to court. And Kyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court.\n\n\u201cHaving failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police WANTED, right from this very moment.\n\n\u201cI must say this publicly. We are not unaware of threats to the lives of NDLEA officers involved in this investigation, even as we continue to do our best to protect our officers and men in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cWe are making this strong statement to those contemplating harmful action against NDLEA officers. They would only succeed in compounding their problems in the event of the murder of or harm to officers and men of NDLEA.\u2019\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By Yusuf Mohammed\n\nNigeria, a country of about 200 million people is full of talents. Speaking of talents, it is one of the epicenters of churning out footballers. In other words, Like Brazil and some other footballing nations, it is also one of the spiritual homes of football.\n\nThe country has the antecedent of producing talents like Jay Jay Okocha, Kanu Nwankwo, Joseph Yobo and a host of others. And there are more talents where the aforementioned came from.\n\nBut it is one thing to know how to play football and it is another thing to stand out and reach for the stars in a country like Nigeria where football talents abound. One young man who has been able to distinguish himself today is Uchenna Christian Junior.\n\nChristian, born on December 30, 2000, is a Nigerian football player who is currently playing for Omole Football Academy in Lagos.\n\nOften considered by many as one of the best young talents in the country, the young footballer, spent two seasons at Ifeanyi Ubah FC, Anambra on loan.\n\nWhile playing at Ifeanyi Ubah FC, which is one of the biggest clubs in the Nigeria, he commanded a first team shirt throughout his spell.\n\nAt just 21, Christian has become the talk of many football pundits and professionals in Nigeria, thanks to his incredible skills that have prompted a host professional footballers and coaches to praise his talent and predict a very bright future.\n\nBorn and raised in Nnewi, a commercial city in Anambra, he relocated to Lagos, one of the biggest commercial cities in Africa, in pursuit of his football dreams. Since then, he has been on the ascendancy due to his standout performances.\n\nDespite his age, he already plays like someone who has been in the business for many years. Apart from his electric pace which makes him a defender\u2019s nightmare, just like Kylian Mbappe, he knows when to slow down and pass the ball. According to his teammates and trainers, \u201che is always happy to take on defenders.\u201d\n\nHe is a complete player with the ability to change games. He has a knack for scoring goals. He is consistent, has good vision, agility, stamina and positioning.\n\nJunior is a highly promising player and has been dubbed the next Eden Hazard. \u2018Hazard\u2019 as he is fondly called by teammates, he has always commanded a first team shirt where ever he has played. Although naturally a winger, he excels more in the centre forward position.\n\nThe Nnewi-born player has caught the attention of many and has led to some top coaches in Nigeria to liken him to several prominent forwards, including former Manchester City player, Sergio Aguero for his sharpness in front of goal. Defenders prefer to have him on their team rather than having him as an opposition, as he is a constant threat in the 18-yard box.\n\nIn 2019, he was one the players that was considered to represent Nigeria at the under 17 World Cup, but due to his age, he wasn\u2019t selected. He was 18 at the time.\n\nHe stands at 1.75 m tall and weighs 65kg. He has a very strong right foot, he is dogged, mobile, has great positioning, and loves to take on defenders.\n\nMany football enthusiasts have tipped him for greater heights outside the shores of Nigeria if he is given the chance.",

          "title": "President Buhari to veto Electoral Bill again",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen on Thursday last week, stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s electoral system gathered in Abuja for a one-day Policy Dialogue organized by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS) in collaboration with West Minister Foundation for Democracy, anxiety was written on the faces of many as they took turns to lament the continued delay in signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.\n\nThe soothing words of Senior Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, who tried to give assurances that the president would append his signature to the bill failed to elicit positive reactions for obvious reasons. It\u2019s a road that has been travelled since early 2018, and the outcome has remained the same.\n\nOmoworare, who was apparently relying second hand information, had noted that he had it on good authority that Buhari was meeting with the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN, and other key stakeholders on the Electoral bill, and that he was inclined to signing the reworked document this time.\n\nBut it\u2019s been two weeks and there is not yet a whimper from the president, a seeming return to an already established pattern of delaying decision on the bill before eventually vetoing same at the last minute.\n\nWith this in mind, discussants at the policy dialogue, among whom were the former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega; current INEC boss, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu; Country Representative of Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adebowale Olorunmola; Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Media, Mr. Benjamin Kalu, among others, while expressing their reservations with the continued delay, appealed to Buhari to assent the bill, as according to them, time was running out.\n\nJega in particular, decried what he described as growing lack of sense of urgency by both the executive and the legislature to complete work on the Electoral Bill, noting that Nigeria cannot continue to dilly-dally much further on the bill and go into fresh elections in 2023 with the same old laws.\n\nOn his part, the INEC Chairman, Prof. Yakubu Mahmood who was represented by his Chief Technical Adviser, Prof., Bolade Eyinla, lamented that the snail pace of work on the Electoral bill was beginning to take a toll on INEC\u2019s preparation for the general elections next February.\n\nHe noted that with the new Electoral law still being awaited; the commission has not been able to come up with clear-cut guidelines for the conduct of the elections, even as he pointed out that the commission, and not the Executive or the National Assembly should initiate proposed amendments to the Electoral laws as being practiced in neighbouring Ghana.\n\nThe concerns and the sense of desperation in the tone of the stakeholders are not misplaced, and if information available to our correspondents is anything to go by, Nigerians hopeful of a new electoral act, as necessary condition to ensure credible polls in 2023, may be hoping in vain, as the bill transmitted to the president fortnight ago by the National Assembly will almost certainly be rejected by the him, even as feelers suggest that it\u2019s a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 between the legislature and the executive that will continue until 2023.\n\nRegarding specifically, the version of the bill transmitted to the president, a reliable Aso Rock source has confirmed to our correspondent that the president has little interest in appending his signature on account of the new insertions the lawmakers made, particularly as it concerns the denial of political appointees of the right to contest in primary elections of political parties.\n\nRecall that among other alterations made on the bill, which was initially vetoed by Buhari in December 2021 over provision for only direct primaries, the lawmakers decided that all political appointees would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of political parties, a move obviously aimed at whittling down the influence of the president and governors in deciding who gets what during party primaries.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election. Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\u201d\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates, even as it forecloses further registration of political parties ahead of next year\u2019s polls.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nThe implication of this is that ministers, commissioners, including members of Buhari\u2019s cabinet, would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties, or will have to resign their appointments outright to be able to contest in primary elections.\n\nThis is contrary to what is presently the case, where ministers and commissioners take leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later return to their jobs, even as governors can no longer use members of their cabinet as delegates during primaries, and given the implication of this both for the president and the governors, many observers agree that it\u2019s unlikely that the president would append his signature to the bill.\n\n\u201cThe hush-hush approach to the amendment of such a critical law, even on the eve of an election appear suspicious, said Okey Okoroji, Lagos based constitutional lawyer. \u201cMy impression is that they don\u2019t want that bill to become law.\n\n\u201cI mean, these people have been in government for more than six years, in fact, it\u2019s their 7th year now. But they have been foot-dragging on the issue as important as improving the electoral system in order that it becomes more democratic, fair and more equitable. I don\u2019t think the president should continue to delay signing of this act. The continued delay is suspicious.\u201d\n\nBusiness Hallmark has it on good authority that a number of state governors, particularly those of the ruling APC are presently lobbying the president to veto the bill, even as its understood that the Attorney General, Malami is unlikely to to advice his principal to append his signature.\n\nIndeed, speaking on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels TV on Monday, Malami who is known to wield enormous influence on the president, and who had advised him to withhold his assent to the first version of the bill in December, hinted that he will still advise the president not to sign the re-transmitted bill if it is against dictates of democracy, which perhaps the decision to stop political appointees seemingly does as it, at first glance, infringes on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nAccording to the minister, the bill, which the National Assembly transmitted to the Presidency the second time on Monday fortnight ago, got to him on Monday last week for legal advice.\n\nMalami who said he had not studied the bill, noted that, \u201cCertainly, if I am not satisfied and if I am of the opinion that it is against the public interest, the national interest; and then against the dictates of democratic process, I would advise accordingly.\u201d\n\nHe added, however: \u201cBut then, one thing I can tell you is that we are all interested in leaving behind a legacy of a lasting democracy; a democracy that indeed accommodates the collective interest of the Nigerian state, and eventually advances the national interest, national development and deepens the democratic process.\u201d\n\nMany observers opine that the move by the lawmakers could be aimed at giving the president yet another reason to withhold his accent, given their known discomfort with electronic transmission of results which happens to be the key objective of the amendment.\n\n\u201cThe administration is deceitful with the issue of amending the electoral act. It is quite unfortunate that despite the fact that a lot of resources have been committed to this issue of amending the act, nothing has come out of it, and in my opinion it is very deliberate,\u201d said Bar Oladotun Hassan, lawyer and president of Yoruba Council of Youths.\n\n\u201cRemember we have had this issue from the last senate. The attempt to amend this act to accommodate electronic voting has been on since the 8th senate, but they have always found a way to make sure that he does not work. They are trying to protect their interest, because you know that what happens in elections is actually imposition. They impose themselves on Nigerians, taking advantage of loopholes in the electoral system. They don\u2019t want such provisions that would make it impossible for them to impose themselves on Nigerians. That is why they are still delaying the amended act.\u201d\n\nIndeed the latest attempt by the 9th senate to amend the electoral act 2010, to accommodate the important aspect of electronic transmission of votes from polling units, have followed a predictable pattern, what many say is an indication that it will end up as it did in 2018, when a similar attempt by the Abubakar Bukola Saraki led 8th senate to accommodate electronic transmission by amending the act, was ultimately rejected by President Buhari who continued to withhold his accent before ultimately arguing on December 10, 2018, that the 2019 polls had become too close and signing the bill into law could disrupt the polls.\n\nElectronic transmission ended up being the most critical issue that tipped the scale in favour of Mr. Buhari at the Supreme Court, at the expense of former vice president and his major challenger at the polls, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who argued in his suit challenging the outcome of polls that returned Buhari as president, that from the votes transmitted electronically by INEC from polling units, via its portal, he won the election.\n\nBut his argument was rejected by the apex court because the country\u2019s electoral law does not recognise such electronic transmission.\n\nDemand for the accommodation of electronic voting prompted agitations by civil society organizations among other stakeholders for the current senate to take up the job of amending the act, after it had sat on it for ages. It eventually did, but it had been to the surprise of many when it emerged in early July last year that the senate was introducing a new provision which provided for total ban of electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThis had formed part of a 121-page document to be laid before the senate at plenary by Kabir Gaya, Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC. The proposed piece of legislation titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to repeal the Electoral Act No 6, 2010 and enact the Electoral Act 2021, to regulate the conduct of Federal, State and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory elections, and for related matters,\u201d had 153 sections and allowed for voluntary electronic voting by secret ballot but ruled out electronic transmission of the votes cast at the poling units.\n\nThis was contained on Page 25 of the document and subtitled procedure at election under Section 50 (2) of the bill which stated: \u201cVoting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission (INEC) which may include electronic voting provided that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means.\u201d\n\nAccording to section. 50 (2) of the draft, \u201cVoting at an election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting, PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of election by electronic means.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers would yet, as anger over the decision swelled, opted to empower the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) to decide for the electoral body where it is applicable to do electronic transmission.\n\nThis caused even more consternation, eventually forcing the lawmakers to make concessions. The new bill eventually passed empowered INEC to transmit results electronically in some parts of the country, but only if it deems it necessary.\n\nThe draft bill read in 52(1): Voting at an election under this bill shall be by open secret ballot.\n\n\u201c52(2) Voting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the commission, which may include electronic voting.\n\n\u201c52(3) The commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nThe bill was eventually transmitted to Buhari in November 2021, but the president declined his assent over direct primaries, noting in a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, \u201cthat the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities.\n\n\u201cIt also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\u201d\n\nMany had expected the lawmakers to simply amend the section that provided for direct primary and re-transmit the bill to Buhari for his signature, but they decided to insert another controversial provision banning political appointees from participating in primary elections.\n\n\u201cThe point is that I\u2019m not convinced that the lawmakers are interested in ensuring that the new act becomes law,\u201d said Okoroji. \u201cBecause if they were, they have the power to override the president even if he refuses to sign the bill. In order words, it\u2019s not a must that Buhari will sign the bill before it becomes law. The national assembly can pass into law by two-third majority if the president fails to sign it, but of course, they won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President, is expected to formally proclaim his alleged presidential ambitions after May 2022, according to top APC sources.\n\nAccording to one of the well-connected party insiders within the APC who is incredibly close to the Vice-President and familiar with the preparations, Osinbajo is reportedly preparing the ground for his ambition and will declare it after May 29.\n\n\u201cHe will be announcing after May to avoid causing any distraction to his current assignment as the VP,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cActually, left to him, he is not interested, but a lot of people are behind him. No one can predict the outcome of his ambition since he doesn\u2019t have the kind of exposure and money that Tinubu has. Many people are worried about Tinubu\u2019s poor health.\u201d\n\nThe APC party insider, also a close ally of former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, noted that the people behind Osinbajo\u2019s presidential ambition \u201care just a cross-section of old and serving legislators but across the country.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Tinubu had not already secured the support of all the legislators, the source said, \u201cNot all of them.\u201d\n\nParty sources further noted that Buhari would not take sides between Tinubu and Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cSince Buhari is not picking a side between the two men, the APC presidential primary will be an open contest between them. Tinubu has the political machinery and structure. Osinbajo has neither. Tinubu is credited with playing a pivotal role in the emergence of Buhari as APC presidential candidate and instrumental in Buhari\u2019s victory over the then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015. Tinubu also was instrumental in nominating Osinbajo as Buhari\u2019s running mate,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that some stalwarts in APC however prefer Osinbajo, because Tinubu reportedly sidelined them regarding federal political appointments or other \u201cjuicy\u201d offers that got to him during the Buhari administration.\n\nThe source said, \u201cFor instance, Tinubu\u2019s nomination of his former Chief of Staff and Special Adviser on media, Mr. Sunday Dare, a political outsider in Oyo State politics as a federal minister for the state slot instead of a battle-tested loyal party member created a rift within the Oyo State APC.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the reasons the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won the gubernatorial and other local elections in Oyo State. Dare is currently Minister of Youth and Sports. Also, the late Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi\u2019s perceived mediocre performance also played a role in APC\u2019s defeat in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, President Buhari\u2019s appointment of Adebayo Shittu, the former Minister of Communications, instead of the more qualified party member also played a role in the APC\u2019s loss in the state. Buhari gave Oyo State ministerial slot to a northerner in Isa Ali Ibrahim, a controversial Islamic cleric. The latter replaced Adebayo Shittu of Oyo State as Minister of Communications.\n\n\u201cAPC members from Oyo State are aggrieved and believe Tinubu should have expressed their frustrations to Buhari.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that Tinubu offended some other party members because he denied them federal appointments under the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cBabafemi Ojudu came out strongly against Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition because Tinubu derailed his appointment as a federal minister. Ojudu used to be an ally of Tinubu. He ran and won as a Senator representing Ekiti Central Senatorial district in the April 2011 election on Tinubu\u2019s former party. Ojudu is currently a special adviser on political matters to the president of Nigeria \u2013 working primarily in the office of Vice-President Osinbajo,\u201d another source said.\n\nA major hurdle ahead of Osinbajo\u2019s presidential ambition would be how to secure victory during the APC presidential primary, other sources revealed.\n\nTinubu is still the frontrunner to win the APC presidential nomination, one of them stated.\n\n\u201cHe recently demonstrated a continued show of force against his political opponents when he visited three influential first-class Yoruba monarchs in Osinbajo\u2019s home state of Ogun. Tinubu was at the palaces of Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Adetona, Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, and the Olu of Ilaro and paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle.\n\n\u201cTinubu stated that he visited the three traditional rulers to inform them that he would contest the 2023 presidential election and seek their royal blessings,\u201d a source said.\n\nAlthough when there were reports that Vice-President Osinbajo would be joining the presidential race after the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26. Mr. Laolu Akande, the spokesperson to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, called it mere speculation.\n\nBut in a chat off the record, Akande did not rule out that Vice-President Osinbajo would be running for president.",

          "title": "APC chair: Mustapha kicks as ANPP caucus, North-east curry favours",
          "text": "As the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) commences the sales of nomination forms for different positions today (Monday) ahead of it national convention February 26, indications have emerged that a caucus of the defunct All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP) mainly from the North-east is already scurrying favour from the presidency.\n\nBut, a leading national chairmanship aspirant from the North-central, Malam Saliu Mustapha, said such decision won\u2019t be a subject of rumour or gossip, adding that party\u2019s decisions on critical issues such as zoning or mode of elections were usually thoroughly debated, arrived at and properly communicated.\n\nMajor contenders for the APC national chairmanship position from the North-east include; former governor of Borno state, Ali Modu Sheriff; Chief Sunny Moniedafe, former Governor of Bauchi state, Isa Yuguda; and another former Governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima.\n\nBlueprint gathered that certain a major factor being considered was that the ANPP bloc of the APC, had not been adequately compensated and accommodated in the scheme of things in the ruling party.\n\nThe move unfolds\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe CPC has the president; the ACN has the Vice President and chairman of party. The ANPP went into the pact with the highest number of states and yet to be properly recognised with political positions.\n\n\u201cBarring any changes, the zoning of the APC national chairmanship to the North-east will take place in the next few days and this will expectedly put to rest earlier rumour that the position had been zoned to the North-central.\u201d\n\nThe source added that in reaching the decision to zone the APC national chairmanship to the North-east, the presidency and the party\u2019s national leadership and indeed its top echelon, might have looked at developments in the party.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the North-east chairmanship aspirants were all on the same page to the effect that one of them should emerge the next APC national chairman to correct the perceived injustice done to the ANPP caucus since the formation of APC 2015.\n\nThe legacy political parties that merged into APC include; All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Congress for Progressives Congress (CPC), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), part of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) led by Sen. Rochas Okorocha, and part of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) under the G7 led by Senator Bukola Saraki.\n\nThe source further said the North-east chairmanship aspirants had presented their case to the presidency and Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and that the agitation was rightly being attended to.\n\n\u201cThey also may have looked at happenings within the party\u2019s ranks and files and the peculiar challenges that would meet it in 2023 general elections when President Muhammadu Buhari would not be on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt was agreed that for the APC to retain the presidency and maintain its winning streak after 2023, its next national chairman must be a person of character, social and economic standing with experience in party administration and a profound understanding of the process of, and intrigues in contesting and winning elections,\u201d the source said.\n\nWe don\u2019t dwell on rumours \u2013Mustapha\n\nBut when contacted for his reaction to the development, Malam Saliu Mustapha campaign organisation dismissed the speculation.\n\nMedia aide to the chairmanship aspirant, Dapo Okunbanjo, said: \u201cThe Saliu Mustapha Campaign Organisation does not dwell on rumours or innuendos. We dwell on concrete, verifiable information that are properly communicated.\n\n\u201cThe people at the helms of affairs of our party are serious minded people; they are not known to be flippant. So, as far as we know, party decisions as important and critical as zoning or mode of elections are usually thoroughly debated, arrived at, and properly communicated. It is not going to be a subject of rumours or gossips.\n\n\u201cBut be that as it may, the stakeholders that are agitating for the North-Central zone to produce the party\u2019s National Chairman in the February 2022 convention have made their case abundantly clear. We believe the party hierarchy, being people who cherish fairness; justice and equity would consider the merit of these agitations in arriving at their decisions for the best interest of the party.\n\n\u201cWe believe our candidate, Malam Saliu Mustapha, having done his homework as dutifully and diligently as the circumstances demand of him, remains the candidate to beat. He is in pole position from the rest because he ticks all the right boxes as the best man to lead the APC into victory in the next election circle in 2023.\u201d\n\nAkume too\n\nAlso reacting to the development, the Sen. George Akume Campaign organisation, another chairmanship aspirant from the North-central, dismissed the agitation by the North-east.\n\nDr Richard Terwase, who spoke on behalf of the Akume group said: \u201cMy only interest is that my principal, Sen. Akume is in the race, and we hope and pray that the party\u2019s leadership will see him as the most capable person to handle that position, am not awear of any zoning.\u201d\n\nForum urges Buhari on N/central\n\nConcerned APC Members Forum has written a letter asking President Muhammadu Buhari to anoint a credible national chairmanship aspirant for the party from the leagues of those seeking the office from the North-central ahead of the party\u2019s national convention February 26.\n\nIn a letter dated 11th February, 2022 and addressed to the president, they also advised him to look into the records of the various individuals aspiring to lead the party, \u201cowing in mind the internal zoning arrangement of the Party which is in North Central Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by its convener, Comrade Okpokwu Ogenyi, believed that unless the president quickly intervenes, the party might be thrown into deeper crisis after the national convention.\n\nThe forum, which said it had intervened at various stages of the APC in the past, declared that \u201cthe quest to safeguard the soul of our Party also gave birth to the Progressive Youth Movement, PYM headed by Mustapha Audu. The PYM even went to court to press home its demands. The agitation also added an addendum to the clamour for a Convention which by God\u2019s grace is holding in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Sir, it was your interview with the Nigeria Television Authority, NTA that prompted the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum to initiate the process of the forthcoming National Convention of our Party slated for 26th February 2022. Again, we say thank you, sir.\n\n\u201cJudging by the activities of the various actors, we appeal to Mr. President not to allow the selfish interest of the 2023 Presidential ambition of some ranking members to destroy the Party. We want Mr. President to recommend a highly committed and disciplined member, a man of humility and resilience with acute knowledge of Party administration that will respect both former and serving Governors, Senators, Ministers, party faithfuls, and of course, the Leaders of our Party.\n\n\u201cWe also want to draw Mr. President\u2019s attention to the fact that, immediately after the Convention, there is a primary election not far away, so, the need to minimize our crises and concentrate on the 2023 general elections is very important.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Sir, in recommending a candidate for the National Chairmanship position which may bring about consensus, we advise Mr. President to look into the records of the various individuals aspiring to lead the Party, owing in mind the internal zoning arrangement of the Party which is in North Central Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey asked Mr President to \u201ccall a meeting of all the aspirants for the National Chairmanship position and hand over the preferred candidate to them, instructing an all-inclusive government. This will immediately heal any injury in the heart of any and the course of explanation to his supporters while he stepped down.\u201d",

          "title": "Executive Order 10: SANs, CSO\u2019s tango over Supreme Court ruling",
          "text": "Controversies have continued to trail the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling which nullified the Executive Order 10 granting financial autonomy to both the state judiciary and legislature.\n\nThe 36 state governors had filed a suit before the Supreme Court asking it to nullify the EO 10 signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe originating summons was lodged at the registry of the court by a team of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) including a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr Augustine O. Alegeh, SAN on behalf of the 36 states.\n\nOther SANs on the team were Babajide Koku, Solomon Umoh, Garba Tetengi, Tawo Eja Tawo, Olaseni Adio, Ekeme Ohvwovoriole, Paul Harris Ogbole, Aikhunegbe A. Malik and Afam Osigwe, Esq., FCIArb among others.\n\nIssues\n\nIn the suit marked SC/CV/655/2020, the governors sought determination of two questions:\n\n\u00b7 Whether by sections 6 and 81(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended), read together with Item 21(e) of the Third Schedule thereof, the Federal Government \u201cis not constitutionally obligated and/or charged with the responsibility for funding all capital and recurrent expenditure of the High Courts, Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal of the States of the Federation of Nigeria, being Courts created under Section 6 of the CFRN.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 Whether by sections 6, 80, 81, 120 and 121 of the Constitution, it is not unlawful for the Presidential Executive Order No. 00-10 of 2020 to compel the Governors to fund State High Courts, States Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal.\n\nAnd in the event the two questions were answered in the affirmative, the governors urged the court to order President Buhari to refund all monies expended by states in funding capital expenditure of the High Courts, Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal of states being courts established by section 6 of the constitution.\n\nThey also sought an order \u201csetting aside the Presidential Executive Order No. 00-10 of 2020 made by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 22nd May, 2020 on the ground that same is in violation of the express provisions of the CFRN and, therefore, unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s ruling\n\nUpon hearing from both parties on the two fundamental issues raised before it, the Supreme Court invited top constitutional lawyers as amici curiae (friends of the court) to advise it on the issues.\n\nWhile rendering the national service, the top legal practitioners were divided in their opinions, with some supporting the state governors while others supported President Buhari\u2019s government on the issue.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Supreme Court, like the amici curiae, in a split decision of six justices to one, declared as illegal the EO 10.\n\nIn its lead judgement delivered by Justice Mohammed Dattijo, the apex court held that President Buhari acted beyond his statutory powers in issuing the Order 10, saying it was inconsistent with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.\n\nSpecifically, Justices Centus Chima Nweze, Hellen Ogunwumiju, Emmanuel Agim, Ejembi Eko and Adamu Jauro, agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nThe court, in its judgement delivered by Justice Dattijo, held that President Buhari over-stepped his bounds with the Executive Order 10, and thereby engaged in breach of the constitution and usurpation of powers of heads of other arms of government.\n\n\u201cThis country is still a federation and the 1999 Constitution it operates is a federal one. The constitution provides a clear delineation of powers between the state and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe president has overstepped the limit of his constitutional powers by issuing the Executive Order 10. The country is run on the basis of the rule of law,\u201d Justice Dattijo held.\n\nDissenting judgement\n\nBut a member of the panel, Justice Uwani Abba-Aji, disagreed with the lead judgement and declared that the Order was in order.\n\nJustice Abba-Aji maintained that the EO 10 was meant to grant fiscal autonomy to both the judiciary and the legislature at the state level.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of the hanky-panky and subterfuge played by state governors against the independence and financial autonomy of state judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is a pitiable eyesore what judicial officers and staff go through financially at the hands of state executives, who often flout constitutional and court orders to their whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions. The Executive Order is to aid the states legislature and judiciary in curing the constitutional wrong of their financial autonomy which the states have always denied. This is not unconstitutional,\u201d the jurist held.\n\nSANs differ\n\nIn his reaction, a prominent South-west lawyer, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), said the Supreme Court judgement on the Executive Order was in order.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court was absolutely right. And thank God for the lives of those justices. They lived up to expectation. They didn\u2019t consider their own personal comfort. The president has good intention but good intention is not enough in a democracy. You cannot usurp the function of the legislature in the name of executive order. You cannot replace the provision of section 4 of the constitution with executive order. The power to make laws belongs the State Assemblies and National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe judgement has no negative implication for the both the state judiciary and the legislature. It is the inability of the executive to implement the constitution that is causing the problem. The constitution has made provision for judicial autonomy. It is separated from the other arms of government. They are not implementing it. Nonetheless, you don\u2019t need executive order to sustain the judiciary\u2019s independence. You don\u2019t need it.\n\n\u201cLook at what the governors are doing. Many of them are also now resorting to executive orders. It is an invitation to anarchy and dictatorship. Where we copy it from, it is not used to make law. You don\u2019t use executive orders to make laws.\u201d\n\nOwonikoko, SAN\n\nAlso in his submission, Mr Abiodun Jelili Owonikoko ((SAN), said the judgement did not in any way open any fresh loophole for governors to exploit.\n\n\u201cI believe the judgment has no negative impact on the autonomy of the judiciary because from day one, the instrument was a non-starter on the very basic that what it sought to do are beyond the provisions of section 121(3) of the constitution as amended by the Fourth Alteration Act No 4 of 2017. What the Executive Order did was to supplant and expand the provisions of the constitution on how to operationalise section 121(3) that has to do with financial autonomy of the legislature and the judiciary at the state level.\n\n\u201cBut as a political move, the Federal Government should still be vindicated that the decision of Mr President to issue that executive order spurred the populace and other role actors to take on their own responsibility for operationalising section 121(3). And what do I mean? In the interval between the executive order and the judgment of the Supreme Court, a lot has happened. The Governor of Lagos State has been compelled by public opinion, pressures from relevant stakeholders like the NBA, JUSUN, and even civil society organisations that have commitment to independent and properly funded judiciary to respond by each of them proceeding now to initiate and pass into law financial autonomy or what they called fund management bills in various states.\u201d\n\nSagay, SAN\n\nBut another legal luminary, Professor Itse Sagay (SAN) differed, saying he was in total agreement with the minority judgement.\n\nSagay said: \u201cI just read the judgement. I was out of the country. I just want to say broadly that I agree with Justice Abba-Aji, the minority judgement. The reason is that the constitution makes it clear that the legislative and judicial branches of state government are to get specific sums of money from what goes to the state. And if the state governors are not making them to have it, all that the executive order has done is to facilitate the implementation of the constitution. And that is what executive orders are supposed to do. So, the Federal Government was right and I agree with the minority judgment entirely.\n\n\u201cBut I agree with the majority judgment where they say that states do not deserve the fund that they have spent on court buildings and other infrastructural expenditure because that is their duty anyway. It is not the duty of the Federal Government. That was what really upset me. It is shameful that state governors could do this and sort of totally defeat everything they have said about independence of state from the control of the Federal Government. If you are asking federal government to be funding everything you are doing, of course, he who pays the piper dictates the tune. So, it is so contradictory. It is very shameful.\u201d\n\nOkutepa, SAN\n\nToeing Sagay\u2019s line of thought, Mr Jibrin Samuel Okutepa (SAN) said the majority judgement of the apex bench missed a golden opportunity to make a policy statement on state governors\u2019 failure to obey court order and provisions of the constitution regarding the financial autonomy of the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has spoken. What again can I say? Nevertheless, my viewpoint is that the Supreme Court, with the greatest respect, the majority judgment missed a golden opportunity of making a policy statement and find a way out of the insubordination and insolence of the state governors who have refused to pay absolute obedience and fidelity to the constitutional provision that makes the judiciary and the legislature autonomous organs of government.\n\n\u201cYes, it is true that unlike American constitution, there is no provision in our constitution that empowers the president to issue Executive Order, but when you look at the provision of Section 5 of the constitution very clearly, it gives the president the executive powers of the federation and the president being the custodian of the Nigerian constitution is under statutory and constitutional duty to ensure that Nigerian constitution is respected and obeyed,\u201d Okutepa argued.\n\nOkutepa , however, added that as a lawyer, he agreed that \u201cthe judgement of the Supreme Court is the majority judgment. There is nothing anybody can do about it as we are bound by it. My respective view therefore is in support of what Prof Ernest Ojukwu, former D G of the Nigerian Law School, said to the effect that the minority judgment of Justice Abba Aji represents a solution to the logjam of the insubordination of the governors of the various states who have refused to give autonomy to the state judiciary and the state houses of assembly. The president was only being carried away by the patriotic and nationalistic view to ensure that the provisions of the constitution are respected.\u201d\n\nOn way out, the silk said: \u201c\u2026the solution will also be to go back to judicial enforcement of judicial order. Mark you, there is a judgement obtained by JUSUN, that have not been enforced. I have always been advocating that the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria can go to court and enforce the judgment by seeking an order compelling the AGF and the accountant general of the federation to deduct their money at source and pay over to them, particularly now that we have the opportunity and the privilege of a president who wants the enforcement of this order, the step which he took. The only way now is to go back to the judiciary by another method either by way of enforcement or by a way of mandamus.\u201d\n\nKalu (SAN)\n\nAlso in yet another reaction, a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Abia state, Prof Awa Kalu (SAN) hailed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, saying enforcement of judicial autonomy is not in the purview of the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court is the final court. Their infallibility lies in the finality of the court. Once they have decided, there is nowhere to go. They have decided. And it is the law. I had written an opinion on the Executive Order 10 when it was issued that it was unconstitutional. What the Supreme Court has done is purely a confirmation of my opinion.\n\n\u201cIn the opinion, I said my source of concern was to confirm that the executive orders are not sources of legislation. This is because, the executive, if you look at distribution of powers under the constitution, simply executes the laws as well as decisions of courts. But you will not use an executive order to legislate. That was what I said at the time and I stand by it.\n\n\u201cJudicial autonomy is not within the purview of the federal government to enforce. It is a brilliant idea stated in the constitution. But within the autonomy of the state, those elements that enforce obedience to the law and the constitution within the state should act. When you have JUSUN for instance, it is a trade union, a major pressure group. So they should continue their discussion with state governments to ensure the maintenance and sustenance of the autonomy of the judiciary.\u201d\n\nCISLAC, others\n\nSimilarly, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) gave separate reactions to the apex court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn his view, Executive Director Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Transparency International Nigeria Auwal Rafsanjani said the judgement never came as a surprise.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all know that it is important to have a judicial autonomy, to have a state legislature autonomy and local government to be allowed to function with fully autonomy.\n\n\u201cHowever, what I expected from Mr President is to engage with State, Local government and other stakeholders on the democratic processes rather than this military decree which has now been challenged by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt clearly shows that he was not properly advised. We want the local government to be more autonomous because the grassroots democracy has been tampered with and it has been affected.\u201d\n\nYaiga Africa\n\nBut the Board member, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwangwu, said the unfortunate judicial closure on the long drawn struggle for even its autonomy can be reignited through the window of the ongoing constitutional amendment.\n\nHe said many of the people \u201cspeaking on restructuring don\u2019t believe in it, a few grandstand or don\u2019t even understand it.\u201d\n\nHe said the vicious control of resources and ambush of the other organs of government especially by the governors would require more than executive order.\n\nHe further said it will need a mobilised citizenry to support the desire of the president take off the stranglehold of the czars in the states on the finances of judiciary and legislature.\n\nLakemfa\n\nIn his reaction, a former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), Owei Lakemfa said the twin cases of \u201cfederalism and impunity in our body polity\u201d were playing out.\n\nIn his view, Supreme Court was only concerned about the danger of allowing the Presidency \u201cacquire more imperial powers by dictating to the states in the guise of enforcing the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand is the impunity of state governments in not implementing the letters and spirit of the constitution as regards the separation of powers that would ensure the independence of the legislature and judiciary.\n\n\u201cThis is a no win situation for the Nigerian people who are played around like football by the political class.\n\n\u201cThe solution is the enlightenment, mobilisation and empowerment of the people to exercise their sovereignty over all powers at whatever level so that all leaders, at whatever level, can be called to order,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Convener Take Back Nigeria Movement and Co- Convener, Say No Campaign, Jaiye Gaskiya explained that what the Supreme Court was to rule that the executive had no such power and voided the Executive Order.\n\n\u201cHowever, what the order sought to enforce are provisions of the constitution on which the courts had earlier made pronouncements affirming the constitutional guarantee of legislative and judicial autonomy, and ordering the the budgets of the two arms should be first line charge and should be appropriated directly to the respective arms.\n\n\u201cWhat should be done now is for the state judiciary and the legislatures to approach the Supreme Court directly to seek enforcement of the constitutional provisions, and the relevant rulings of the courts, include seeking an order to direct the Federation account, and or the federal government to deduct such appropriations at source and credit same to the respective judiciaries and legislatures of the states; if the states failed to comply with the ruling of the supreme court on the matter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018EO 10 unnecessary\u2019\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a political analyst, Mr Jide Ojo, said Executive Order 10 was highly unnecessary, describing the Supreme Court Judgement as an informal way to restructure the country.\n\nOjo told one of or correspondents that \u201cExecutive order 10 is just an enabled law, it is highly unnecessary. The President did that to fast track the implementation of the financial economy to states\u2019 judiciary and legislature.\n\n\u201cBut the constitution which is the supreme that is the grand norm of all legislation in Nigeria had already stated incontrovertibly that there should be financial autonomy to state judiciary and legislature.\u201d\n\nThe political analyst noted that \u201ca framework was agreed upon in 2021 by Nigeria Governors Forum, and it is what many of the states are now cuing into to implement financial economy for their state assembly and judiciary.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors challenged was the arbitrariness of being coerced by the federal government to implement something which they felt was executive recklessness. And 6 out of 7 Judges of the Supreme Court agreed with the governors that, yes executive order 10 was highly unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also shows that the governors are not mere appendices of the federal government or that the state is not just a mere appendices but they are independent, and cannot be dictated to by the state.\n\n\u201cThis also has arisen over the issue of Value Added Tax, it has also arisen over the issue of Police Equipment Trust Fund which Rivers State Government Challenged.\n\n\u201cI think is just the restructuring we are talking about that is gradually coming out to play. Restructuring can take any form, it can take the form of legislation, it can also take the form of judicial pronouncement. And now we know that the federal government cannot dictate to the state as to the way and manner they should govern their territories.\u201d\n\nOjo who said the outcome was good for Nigeria democracy, expressing the hope that in going forward, \u201cthe federal government would have learnt the limits of its power under this situation.\u201d",
          "summary": "They also sought an order \u201csetting aside the Presidential Executive Order No.\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions.\nSANs differIn his reaction, a prominent South-west lawyer, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), said the Supreme Court judgement on the Executive Order was in order.\nIn the interval between the executive order and the judgment of the Supreme Court, a lot has happened.\nOjo told one of or correspondents that \u201cExecutive order 10 is just an enabled law, it is highly unnecessary.",

          "title": "NDLEA Declares Abba Kyari Wanted For Drug Trafficking",
          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has declared suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, wanted over alleged links with drug trafficking.\n\nNDLEA spokesperson Femi Babafemi made the announcement during a press conference in Abuja on Monday.\n\nBefore his suspension over links with convicted fraudster Hushpuppi, Mr Kyari was the Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nREAD ALSO: ASUU Declares One-Month Warning Strike\n\nAccording to the NDLEA, he is wanted over his involvement in a 25 kilograms Cocaine deal.\n\nThe Agency said it declared Mr Kyari wanted after all efforts to get him to honour formal invitations for his interrogation failed.\n\nIt bemoaned a situation where those who are supposed to support current efforts to stem the tide of illicit drug trafficking and abuse are themselves neck deep in the menace.\n\n\u201cThere is no better way to start this press briefing than to remind us about the enormity of the drug problem Nigeria has on its hand and the imperative of all well-meaning Nigerians to play a positive role in curbing the illicit drug menace,\u201d Mr Babafemi said on Monday.\n\n\u201cEven before the damning findings of the 2018 National Drug Use and Health Survey, Nigeria\u2019s drug problem was getting close to epidemic proportion. And if anything, the arrests and seizures by NDLEA in the past 12 months is an indication that the country\u2019s drug problem was grossly underestimated before President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s resolve to strengthen the NDLEA and the subsequent launch of offensive action by the Agency to clean the society of the menace.\n\n\u201cAnd in just 12 months, even the most cynical of Nigerians now agree that the country is really in a drug quagmire and therefore appreciates the relentless efforts of NDLEA operatives.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some law enforcement agents who should be partners in the pursuit of the President\u2019s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law, as they aid and abet drug trafficking in the country.\n\n\u201cToday, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal, the Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the Agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\u201d\n\nThe drug deal\n\nAccording to the NDLEA, Kyari had initiated a call to one of its officers on Friday, January 21, 2022.\n\n\u201cWhen the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service,\u201d Mr Babafemi said.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\n\u201cBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the Agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and himself and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold.\n\n\u201cHe then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg. At N7m per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35m, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team. He put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\n\u201cThe next day January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnd by 5: 23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting. In their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies. He also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots. The reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61, 400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining that relevant channels of communication were duly followed in the demand for Kyari without any result, the NDLEA said it cannot continue to keep other suspects in the case indefinitely while the principal suspect fails to honour official invitation.\n\n\u201cNDLEA has the mandate to take custody of suspects and consignments of drugs seized by other arms of law enforcement,\u201d Mr Babafemi said. \u201cAnd there is a standard protocol for such transfer. This we duly followed. The suspects and drugs were delivered to us on February 8 but the last part of the process, yet to be completed, is the debriefing of Kyari.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded. We are a law-abiding agency of government. We follow due process. In that vein, we will not detain suspects beyond the stipulated period according to the law before we charge them to court. And Kyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court.\n\n\u201cHaving failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police WANTED, right from this very moment.\n\nThe NDLEA said that it\u2019s not unaware of threats to the lives of its officers involved in the case, assuring that it would do everything to protect its officers.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of threats to the lives of NDLEA officers involved in this investigation, even as we continue to do our best to protect our officers and men in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cWe are making this strong statement to those contemplating harmful action against NDLEA officers. They would only succeed in compounding their problems in the event of the murder of or harm to officers and men of NDLEA.\u201d",

According to him, the industrial action, which begins immediately, is \u201ccomprehensive and total\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to see our students at home. We don\u2019t want our academic calendars disrupted but our demands are not met,\u201d he said\n\nSome of the lecturer\u2019s demands include the revitalisation of public universities, earned allowance, improved funding of state universities, and promotion arrears.\n\nOthers are the replacement of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) with its own University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) in the payment of emoluments to its member.\n\nRead Also: I Will Not Give ASUU The Opportunity To Go On Strike \u2013 Ngige\n\nBefore the latest move, the union had embarked on a sensitisation campaign across campuses in the country, leading to lecture-free periods.

We demand an immediate review of transport freight rates to reflect the operational realities of the petroleum distribution value chain.\n\n\u201cFor these critical issues, we have the mandate of the National Executive Council of the union to commence immediate mobilisation of all our members for resumption of our earlier suspended action.\u201d",

          "text": "The busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing was open Monday after protesters demonstrating against COVID-19 measures blocked it for nearly a week, but a larger protest in the capital, Ottawa, persisted as city residents seethed over authorities\u2019 inability to reclaim the streets.\n\nDemonstrations against COVID-19 restrictions and other issues have blocked several crossings along the U.S.-Canada border and hurt the economies of both nations. They also inspired similar convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that truck convoys may be in the works in the United States.\n\nPolice in Windsor, Ontario, arrested 25 to 30 protesters and towed several vehicles Sunday near the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor \u2014 and numerous Canadian automotive plants \u2014 with Detroit. The bridge reopened to traffic late Sunday night, a spokeswoman for bridge owner Detroit International Bridge Co. confirmed. Canada Border Services also confirmed that the bridge is open.\n\nAfter protesters began blocking bridge access Feb. 7, automakers began shutting down or reducing production \u2014 at a time when the industry is already struggling with pandemic-induced shortages of computer chips and other supply-chain disruptions. The crossing sees 25% of all trade between the two countries.\n\n\u201cToday, our national economic crisis at the Ambassador Bridge came to an end,\u201d said Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens. \u201cBorder crossings will reopen when it is safe to do so and I defer to police and border agencies to make that determination.\u201d\n\nAbout 470 miles (750 kilometers) northeast of Windsor, the protest in Ottawa has paralyzed downtown, infuriated residents who are fed up with police inaction and turned up pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nA senior government official said Trudeau will meet virtually with the leaders of Canada\u2019s provinces on Monday morning. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe city had appeared to have reached a deal in which protesters, who have jammed downtown streets for more than two weeks, would move out of residential areas, but those prospects soon faded.\n\nMayor Jim Watson said Sunday that he agreed to meet with demonstrators if they confined their protest to an area around Parliament Hill and moved their trucks and other vehicles out of residential neighborhoods by noon Monday. He shared a letter from one of the protest\u2019s organizers, Tamara Lich, in which she said demonstrators \u201cagree with your request\u201d to focus activities at Parliament Hill.\n\nBut Lich later denied there was an agreement, saying in a tweet: \u201cNo deal has been made. End the mandates, end the passports. That is why we are here.\u201d\n\nIn a letter Watson wrote to protesters, he said residents are \u201cexhausted\u2033 and \u201con edge\u201d due to the demonstrations, and he warned that some businesses are teetering on the brink of permanent closure because of the disruptions.\n\nIn Surrey, British Columbia, police arrested four demonstrators Sunday, and officers in Alberta said they intercepted and disabled three excavators that were being brought to a border blockade in the town of Coutts.\n\nWhile the protesters are decrying vaccine mandates for truckers and other COVID-19 restrictions, many of Canada\u2019s public health measures, such as mask rules and vaccine passports for getting into restaurants and theaters, are already falling away as the omicron surge levels off.\n\nPandemic restrictions have been far stricter in Canada than in the U.S., but Canadians have largely supported them. The vast majority of Canadians are vaccinated, and the COVID-19 death rate is one-third that of the United States.\n\nA judge on Friday ordered an end to the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency allowing for fines of 100,000 Canadian dollars and up to one year in jail for anyone illegally blocking roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration on Sunday acknowledged the resolution to the bridge demonstration, which it said had \u201cwidespread damaging impacts\u201d on the \u201clives and livelihoods of people\u201d on both sides of the border.\n\nThe Windsor protest began to dwindle Saturday after police persuaded many protesters to remove vehicles blocking the road to the bridge. But in Ottawa, Saturday\u2019s crowd swelled to what police said were 4,000 demonstrators, and a counter-protest of frustrated Ottawa residents attempting to block the convoy of trucks from entering downtown emerged Sunday.\n\nClayton Goodwin, a 45-year-old military veteran who was among the counterprotesters, said it was time for residents to stand up against the protesters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m horrified that other veterans would be down there co-opting my flag, co-opting my service,\u201d said Goodwin, who is the CEO of the Veterans Accountability Commission, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s a grift. The city was free. We\u2019re 92% vaccinated. We\u2019re ready to support our businesses.\u201d\n\nColleen Sinclair, another counterprotester, said the demonstrators have had their say and need to move on \u2014 with police force, if necessary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re occupiers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is domestic terrorism and we want you out of our city. Go home.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has so far rejected calls to use the military, but has said \u201call options are on the table\u201d to end the protests. Trudeau has called the protesters a \u201cfringe\u201d of Canadian society. Both federal and provincial politicians have said they can\u2019t order police what to do.\n\nMajor-General Steve Boivin, commander of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, said Sunday that two of his special forces soldiers were supporting the protests in Ottawa and were in the \u201cprocess of being released\u201d from service. Boivin said the activity goes against the military\u2019s values and ethics.",

          "text": "The European Union (EU) has announced that it would invest \u20ac150 billion in Africa over a seven-year period in furtherance of the EU-Africa Digilogic, which is a sustainable network of Digital Innovation Hubs in Europe and Africa.\n\nThe EU also stated that it would commit \u20ac820 million to advance the EU-Nigeria Digital Economy Package that would run for three years under the EU\u2019s global gateway initiative.\n\nThese were announced at the weekend, in Lagos, by representatives of the European Commission during an interactive roundtable with youth, innovators, start-ups and women entrepreneurs that was organised by The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) and the European Commission.\n\nAn Adviser to European Commission Executive Vice President, Mr. Alejandro Caintos, said during the forum that there would be a summit between the African Union (AU) and the EU for the commission to come with its complete deliverables on global investment for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe will mobilise \u20ac150 billion in the next seven years into the African continent,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the \u20ac820 million planned investment in Nigeria, he explained that the fund would be targeted at digital infrastructure investment, digitalisation of public services, encouragement of digital entrepreneurship, and acquisition of digital skills for Nigerian youths and enhancement of digital governance.\n\n\u201cThe EU will support building the fibre optic cables and data centres needed to improve Nigerian\u2019s access to high speed connectivity. The European Investment Bank (EIB) will invest E100 million to expand secure 4G connectivity in Lagos and Ogun States and triple national data capability.\n\n\u201cThe EU will support the digitalisation of Nigeria\u2019s administration to allow better and more accessible public services to citizens,\u201d the commission said.\n\nHe said the EIB \u201cis investing \u20ac250 million to strengthen Nigeria\u2019s digital identity infrastructure with the highest data protection standards.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cThe EU will support the creation and scaling up of tech start-ups and boost innovative solutions for Nigeria\u2019s society and economy.\u201d\n\nThe commission said the EU would support Nigeria\u2019s digital governance by helping, \u201cthe development of regulatory frameworks with the highest standards of privacy, safety and cyber security, while promoting an open internet and digital market that upholds citizens\u2019 right.\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s Head of Unit, Western Africa, Ms. Francesca Di Mauro, said, \u201cthis digital economy package will take the EU-Nigeria partnership to the next level, working together to make the most of the opportunities of the data economy.\u201d\n\nMauro also said the EU, \u201cwill support the development of the skills needed for Nigerians to succeed in the digital economy, with a focus on youth and women.\u201d\n\nShe said the Tony Elumelu Foundation truly combined everything that the EU, \u201cstands for by promoting the private sector, women enterprise and focusing on youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are precisely devoted to giving the youths a voice and opportunities. Year 2022 is the \u2018Year of the Youth in Europe.\u2019 As part of a \u20ac44 million grant to the Nigeria Jubilee Fellowship Program, the EU will support on-the-job training for young Nigerians in the ICT sector,\u201d Mauro added.\n\nOn her part, the Managing Director of TEF, Mrs. Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu, traced the foundation\u2019s partnership with the European Commission to 2021 when the commission invested \u20ac20 million in African women entrepreneurship through the foundation.\n\nUgochukwu described as, \u201ca bold first step to creating hope for young African women entrepreneurs who are brimming with innovation, brimming with creativity and brimming with entrepreneurial ideas. This intervention of the European Commission made the difference to many entrepreneurs on whether their ideas will go to the grave with them or be turned into a reality.\u201d\n\nShe said Africa\u2019s annual share of global investment in tech start-ups was still very negligible at less than one per cent of what start-ups could raise in the United States of America, in spite of the World Economic Forum\u2019s estimate that $1.2 billion, representing over 300 per cent increase, was invested in tech start-ups in Africa in 2020.\n\n\u201cAs high as that sounds, it is less than one per cent of what the USA\u2019s startups raised. That shows that even if we are doing a lot in the continent there is still so much work to be done. That is why we are all here today.\n\n\u201cThat is also the reason for the TEF partnership with the EU. We started in 2021 through E20 million (Euros) partnership to invest in women African entrepreneurs. And I am pleased to say that this partnership is moving forward.\u201d\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari over the failure to publish the terms and conditions of the agreement, which the federal government recently signed with Twitter Inc. before the lifting the ban on the micro-blogging and social networking service in Nigeria.\n\nJoined in the suit, as respondent, was Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nThe federal government had in January lifted the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria, stating, \u201cTwitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history.\u201d\n\nBut in the suit, FHC/L/CS/238/2022, filed last Friday, at the Federal High Court, Lagos, SERAP asked the court to direct and compel Buhari and Mohammed to release and widely publish copy of the agreement with Twitter, and the terms and conditions of any such agreement.\n\nIn the suit, SERAP argued that it was in the interest of justice to grant the application, saying publishing the agreement would enable Nigerians to scrutinise it, seek legal remedies as appropriate and ensure that the conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter were not used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse.\n\nSERAP while noting that the minister responded to its freedom of information request, however said his response was completely unsatisfactory, as he merely stated that the details were in the public space, without sending a copy of the agreement as requested.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part, \u201cNigerians are entitled to their human rights, such as the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, privacy, peaceful assembly and association, as well as public participation both offline and online.\n\n\u201cThe operation and enforcement of the agreement may be based on broadly worded restrictive laws, which may be used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse, interfere with online privacy, and deter the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the federal government announcing the lifting of the suspension of Twitter after seven months used overly broad terms and phrases like \u2018prohibited publication\u2019, \u2018Nigerian laws\u2019, \u2018national culture and history.\u2019 These open-ended terms and phrases may be used to suppress legitimate exercise of human rights online. Any agreement with social media companies must not be used as a ploy to tighten governmental control over access to the internet, monitor internet activity, or to increase online censorship and the capacity of the government to restrict legitimate online content, contrary to standards on freedom of expression and privacy.\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee the right to hold opinions without interference, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any medium.\n\n\u201cThe government has a legal obligation to promote universal Internet access, media diversity and independence, as well as ensure that any agreements with Twitter and other social media companies are not used to impermissibly restrict these fundamental human rights.
