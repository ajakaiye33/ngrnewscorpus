          "title": "Kaduna has hired 50 truckloads of thugs to attack protesting workers -NLC",
          "text": "The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, has said Kaduna State Government under the leadership of Governor Nasir El-Rufai has hired 50 truckloads of thugs to attack protesting workers in the state.\n\nWabba stated this on Wednesday while featuring on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nHe alleged that the governor paid N500 each to some youths to disrupt the demonstration of the workers who protested the mass sacking of civil servants in the state on Tuesday.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that thugs disrupted the demonstration of workers in the state on Tuesday. The state workers had on Monday begun a five-day strike over the governor\u2019s retrenchment of about 60,000 workers and the alleged anti-labour policies of the government.\n\nThe NLC subsequently condemned the attack and threatened to embark on a nationwide strike.\n\nSpeaking on the television programme on Wednesday morning, Wabba said, \u201cAs I speak with you this morning, the security agencies are already there and they (Kaduna) have hired about 50 trucks of thugs to try to invade the NLC state office where our people are already converging. Is this democracy? Even under military (regime), labour leaders, labour laws have not been violated as it is today.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are already there, they are taking pictures, they are recording everything, all the vehicles, all the people.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Tuesday), those people that were hired to carry placards, I have the records, they were paid N500 each. In fact, I have them on record, they are youths, most of them are below the age of 17. What kind of system are we running? The press needs to ask them what are they protesting for because our people that are affected, their stories can be heard. Basically, propaganda in this case must be exposed.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the governor on Tuesday declared the NLC President wanted for economic sabotage but Wabba dared El-Rufai to effect his arrest even as the union leader led workers on protest for the second day on Tuesday.\n\nKaduna State has been grounded for about 72 hours as aviation workers, bank workers, rail workers, electricity workers, health workers, teachers, amongst others, down tools in protest against the alleged injustice of the El-Rufai-led government.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, the NLC president described the El-Rufai government as \u201ctyrannical\u201d, \u201cadamant\u201d and \u201cpowerdrunk\u201d. He also lamented that the governor was celebrating the disengagement of workers in the state citing paucity of funds.\n\nWabba said, \u201cThe issue we are engaging in Kaduna is about the fundamental rights of a worker. A worker is not a slave; employment relationship is guided by laws and those laws are very explicit. Our laws are very rich and there are provisions of the law on every subject matter. You cannot just throw workers out of jobs.\n\n\u201cCan any Nigerian not even trade unions fold our arms and watch a situation where breadwinners of families in their thousands are disengaged? What will be the social consequences? Already we are witnessing it. This is a core labour issue and that is why NLC is engaging the issue.\u201d\n\nThe NLC president also said the union followed the law to give adequate notice in writing before the commencement of the strike \u201cbut the government of Kaduna State has remained adamant because we are in a situation where people that are powerdrunk can continue to do whatever they want to do\u201d.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWhat is happening is crude abuse of power and every Nigerian has now seen it. This action is going to be limited to Kaduna for five days and we are still here (Kaduna) and we are going to continue for these five days and where it fails, certainly we are going to escalate it because we believe that we have tiers of government and on this matter, we are very concerned and that is why we cannot change our position because justice has not be done to those workers.\n\n\u201cHow can somebody be celebrating the sack of workers? Is it the only state that has challenge economically? In many states, I will give examples: when Kano State try to revert to the minimum wage, immediately we wrote the governor and he requested for dialogue. He put the facts on the table and solutions were put on the table, the same thing in Rivers State but in Kaduna, we are dealing with a tyrant who does not have respect for the rule of law.\u201d",

KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!\u201d\n\nArmed thugs attack Labour leaders\n\nThe attack on Labour leaders took place after Governor el- Rufai left the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN, adjacent where the workers had assembled with heavily armed security operatives.\n\nThe armed thugs came in a bus and attacked the Labour leaders with various weapons like stick, bottles, stones and machete\n\nWabba blames el-Rufai\n\nWhen the situation was brought under control, Wabba blamed Governor el-Rufai for the attack and vowed that organized labour would not be intimidated\n\nAccording to him, NLC was fully aware of the plan by the state governor to unleash thugs on them, and had as early as Tuesday morning shared the information and the video clips of the plan with security agencies.\n\nWabba said \u201c\u201dWe said it in the morning. We mentioned the name of the person that was contracted. We mentioned the thugs that will be coming and I told all the security agencies, I called the DSS, I called the police, I told them that this is the credible information we have. We have the clip. This clip was trending since 6 am.\n\n\u201cThey had the meeting in the night and we shared our intelligence with the police and the DSS. We were fully aware and that was why we informed the security agencies because it is the role of the security agencies to provide security cover for any protest.\n\nElectricity workers\n\nReacting, Deputy President of NLC and General Secretary of NUEE, Joe Ajaero, among others, warned that the power blackout would go national from Friday, if the situation remained the same and el-Rufai refused to do the needful. The NLC had warned earlier that if after the five day warning strike, the state governor failed to address the issues, workers across the country would join in solidarity and commence a nationwide strike\u201d.\n\nNUPENG\n\nReacting to the development, NUPENG expressed sadness over the attack\n\nIn a statement by its President and General Secretary, Prince Williams Akporeha and Afolabi Olawale, among others, said \u201cUnion is calling on the Federal Government to immediately call on Kaduna State Governor Mallam Nasir el-Rufai to order before his arrogance and ego further push the situation into horrendous calamity as he has been doing in all issues relating to human lives and wellbeing.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Union reiterates that no Labour Leaders or workers as the case may be harmed, harassed, maimed, humiliated or victimized during this 5-day peaceful protests in the state. Our Union is raising this alarm following the very reliable report of the clandestine move of Governor Nasir el-RUfai to hurt and put the lives of NLC President, Ayuba Wabba and other labour leaders to danger in his usual blind egotistical style of running government in the State\n\nFalana Group\n\nOn his part, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond, ASCAB,, said Governor el-Rufai, lacked the powers to declare the President of NLC and other labour wanted, saying, the declaration \u201cis laughable as it is common knowledge that Wabba and his colleagues are on the streets of Kaduna leading the peaceful protests embarked upon by the entire workers in the State since yesterday. The order of the Governor cannot be enforced for the following reasons:\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nIn a statement by Mr. Femi Falana SAN, said \u201cBy the combined effect of the Trade Union Act and the Nigerian Constitution, Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have the unquestionable rights to participate in the peaceful warning strike and mass protests against further retrenchment of workers in the Kaduna State public service.\n\nSERAP\n\nSimilarly, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP,urged Kaduna Governor el-Rufai to \u201cimmediately end growing crackdown on workers and protesters in his state.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation, said: \u201cGovernor, Nasir El-Rufai and Kaduna state authorities must end the harassment and intimidation of NLC leaders and to withdraw the illegal statement declaring Mr Wabba and other NLC leaders \u2018wanted\u2019.\n\nThe statement, read in part: \u201cKaduna authorities must respect the human rights of Nigerian workers, and ensure the safety and security of the leaders of Nigeria Labour Congress. Declaring NLC leaders \u2018wanted\u2019 simply for peacefully exercising their human rights is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) and the country\u2019s international obligations.\u201d\n\nAPC govs seek dialogue\n\nMeanwhile, APC governors under the aegis of the Progressive Governors Forum PGF in a statement by their chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, said\n\n\u201cNoting all the challenges facing all our states, especially given dwindling revenue, we appeal to all patriotic Nigerians, including the NLC, to demonstrate more commitment toward engaging governments at all levels to address problems. This is not the time for muscle flexing\u201d, they stated.\n\nAccording to the APC governors, Nigerians are already overstretched with many challenges, adding that \u201cat this critical point of our democratic journey, there cannot be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens\u201d.\n\n\u201cEvery step must be therefore taken to resolve the current face-off between the Kaduna State Government and NLC. We appeal to both the State Government and NLC to return to the negotiating table\u201d, they counseled.\n\nNorthern govs\n\nAlso, the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, through its Chairman and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong in a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Makut Macham said the Forum is \u201cconcerned about the impact of the strike on the State and its citizens.\n\nWhile calling for dialogue and negotiations which is a long standing dispute mechanism in labour relations, the Northern Governors called for \u201crestraint and de-escalation of the situation to enable for amicable settlement of the issues in question.\u201d\u201dThis is only possible when both parties operate within the law and approved conventions in ventilating their grievances as well as avoid making comments or taking actions that will further exacerbate the situation thereby heightening tension.\u201d\n\nFG wades into face-off\n\nMeantime, the Federal Government yesterday waded into the ongoing faceoff between Organised Labour and Kaduna State government over mass sack of workers\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige appealed to the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasiru el Rufai, the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba as well as President of Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, TUC, TUC, Quadiri Olaleye to immediately cease fire.\n\nThe Minister in a statement by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations in the Ministry, Charles Akpan, said, \u201cWe are not unaware of what is going on in Kaduna State . It is a labour issue which has snowballed into a national strike and picketing by the two labour centres and affiliate unions .\n\n\u201cWe hope and also pray the Kaduna State Governor not to escalate matters to such a level where it becomes uncontrollable. We also appeal to the leaders of the labour centres to step down action to make way for discussion.\n\n\u201cMy Ministry is wading into the matter and therefore calls on the two warring parties to give peace a chance . Importantly, I appeal to workers in critical sectors not to tamper with electrical or water installations so as not to bring more sufferings to the people of Kaduna and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cThis is because we have it on good authority, following a complaints by the Minster of Power that workers have threatened to trigger a nation-wide blackout by interfering or switching off the national grid.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Islamic human rights group, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has warned against the move by the Nigerian legislature to legalise cannabis in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the group, the legalization of cannabis will be the last nail in the coffin of morality in Nigeria.\n\nRecall that Benjamin Kalu, a spokesman of the House of Representatives, had on Monday in Akure, Ondo State, said that cannabis would aid Nigeria\u2019s industrial drive and boost her internally generated revenue (IGR).\n\nBut MURIC, reacting to this in a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, said it strongly condemned the attempt to compartmentalise Nigerians into vicious drug cartels.\n\nThe group accused Kalu of trying to turn Nigeria into another Mexico on the African continent, adding that the country already has serious security challenges which could be compounded by the legalisation of cannabis.\n\n\u201cThe security challenges we are currently facing are punishments for our recklessness. Instead of thinking of making criminal elements in the country \u2018turn back from their evil\u2019, Kalu wants to cap the edifice with drug war,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that the legalisation of cannabis will be the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back in terms of its impact on insecurity and the last nail in the coffin of morality in Nigeria in terms of the country\u2019s descent into the abyss of moral debauchery which began a long time ago,\u201d it said.\n\nMURIC further made a connection between Kalu\u2019s statement and an earlier position of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on the matter.\n\n\u201cThis lawmaker spoke in Akure, the capital of Ondo State. Nigerians will recall that Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has been advocating for the legalisation of cannabis since 2019,\u201d MURIC said, adding that \u201cThere is no doubt that he has not given up. Kalu is his latest recruit into his cannabis promotion camp.\n\n\u201cThe Akeredolu school of thought is only thinking of the material aspect and economic gains obtainable from the legalisation of cannabis sativa (also known as Indian hemp).\n\n\u201cHave they put in place the necessary precautions? Do Nigerians obey laws? Do they listen to simple instructions?\u201d, MURIC added.\n\nThe group further attributed major road accidents to the use of cannabis by commercial drivers.\n\nMURIC also believes that those who burned hundreds of luxurious buses of the Lagos State Government during the #EndSARS protests were under the influence of drugs.\n\n\u201cNigeria is passing through unimaginable social trauma at this period. The crime rate is very high and it is mostly induced by drug.\n\nThe major point raised by Kalu and Akeredolu has been economic benefit but what have the politicians done with all the billions of dollars from oil all these years?\n\n\u201cCannabis may have its benefits but the disadvantages outway the advantages,\u201d MURIC said while calling on the federal lawmakers to reject any attempt to smuggle the cannabis bill into the hallowed House.",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu and Tony Akowe, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammdu Buhari is seeking the approval of the National Assembly to borrow $6.183 billion.\n\nThe cash (about N2, 343 trillion) if secured, will enable the Federal Government to finance the deficit of N5.602 trillion in this year\u2019s Appropriation Act.\n\nThe President\u2019s requests were contained in separate memos to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nSenator Lawan read the letter addressed to him on the floor of the Red Chamber at plenary yesterday.\n\nHe also asked the Senate to give concurrent approval for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan of $36,837,281,256.00 plus Euro 910,000,000.00 and grant component of $10,000,000.00.\n\nBuhari explained that the requests were in line with the provisions of Section 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (DMO) Establishment Act 2003.\n\nTagged: \u201cRequest for the resolution of the National Assembly for the implementation of the new external borrowing of N2.343 trillion (about $6.183 billion) in the 2021 Approved Act,\u201d Buhari explained modalities for the loan.\n\nThe President said he forwarded the memo to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379 provided as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (Item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50% or $2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with the Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and to free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nOn the government\u2019s funding plan, the President said: \u201cI wish to bring to the attention of the President of the Senate that the plan is to raise the sum of $6.183 billion from a combination of sources; namely: multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cFrom recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds in the ICM and this explains why we are proposing that the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Nigeria may be able to raise USD3 billion or more, but not more than USD 6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five \u2014 30 years; the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approaches the market.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may further wish. to note that not only is the ICM now open to issuers like Nigeria and Interest Rates lower than the levels in 2020, given the recent monetary policy stance, as well as, rising levels of inflation, the level of liquidity in the domestic market has decreased while domestic Interest Rates are beginning to rise.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, accessing the ICM will be relatively cheaper thereby moderating debt service cost, and it will also contribute to the level of External Reserves.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the utilisation of the loan, Buhari said: \u201cThe proceeds of the $6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act) will be used to fund specific capital projects in the budget.\n\n\u201cThese include projects from priority sectors of the economy, namely: Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, Provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral projects, Defence and Water Resources.\u201d\n\nOn summary of indicative terms and conditions, the President said: \u201cWith respect to the terms and conditions of the proposed external borrowings, the President of the Senate may wish to note that the multilateral and bilateral institutions operate on standard terms and conditions and these are outlined in appendix II.\u201d\n\nOn the Eurobonds, Buhari said the final terms and conditions (interest rate and tenors) can only be determined at the point of issuance of the bonds in the ICM and will be subject to market conditions prevailing at that time.\n\n\u201cIn the event that some or all of the $6,183,081,643.40 has to be raised through Eurobonds, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning and the Debt Management Office, working with the Federal Government\u2019s appointed transaction advisers, will ensure that Nigeria secures the best terms and conditions within the context of the market\u201d, he said.\n\nBuhari urged the Senate to note that \u201cin line with the previsions of Sections 21 (1) and 27 (1) of the DMO Act, a specific Resolution of the NASS (National Assembly) is required for external borrowing as stated\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the President invited the Senate to consider and approve a resolution as requested.\u201d\n\nOn concurrent approval for donor fund projects, Buhari said that the request is under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan, at a total sum of $36,837,281,256.00 plus Euro 910,000,000.00 and grant component of $10,000,000.00 to become\n\nOn the the 2018 \u2013 2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan donor-funded projects for consideration and concurrent approval of the Senate, he said: \u201dThe projects listed under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China EXIMBank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) at $36,837,281,256 plus Euro 910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000.\u201d",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Onyedi Ojiabor, Abuja\n\nLabour warns against plan\n\nLCCI: we need innovative policy on petroleum\n\nSubsidy on petrol will soon be withdrawn, Minister of State for Petroleum Timipre Sylva, said yesterday.\n\nThe minister told reporters there is no going back on the decision because the government can no longer afford it.\n\nSylva explained that although withdrawal of subsidy will be painful initially, it will pay off for the poor in the long run.\n\nAccording to him, the present arrangement favours a few rich individuals and firms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLabour yesterday described the plan to remove subsidy as an attempt to punish the people for government\u2019s inefficiency.\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said although desirable, government needs a stable policy in the petroleum industry.\n\nThe minister lamented that but for the provision of cash from signature businesses from Marginal Oil fields by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the shortfall in remittance into the Federal Account last month would have been unbearable for the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nNot forthcoming on the actual augmentation figure and how long the DPR will continue to intervene, Sylva said: \u201cI cannot say exactly what the figure is. I will have to check with the DPR to get you the figure. Of course, you know that the DPR has always contributed to the federation revenue because they collect royalties and so on\n\n\u201cBut as to filling the gap, it will not always be there, it is not as if the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that after last month, they will not be able to. You may not know when next they will announce it. So, you cannot say that they (DPR) will continue to fill in the gap.\n\n\u201cNNPC announced that they could not make contributions to FAAC and the DPR came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cLuckily the DPR was in the position to step in and the marginal field revenues were used to fill the gap.\n\nSylva added: \u201cLabour and the Federal Government are not on different pages. Even Labour understands but what we have agreed is that we need to have an alternative and the process of putting it in place is what is ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe minister, who spoke to reporters in Abuja, said: \u201cSubsidy removal will come with some pains but the question is, can we continue with petroleum subsidy as a country? If we cannot continue, what options do we have?\n\n\u201cI think the best is take out subsidy. From the government of ex-Military President Ibrahim Babangida in the 80s, it has defied all efforts to withdraw petrol subsidy. Diesel is now deregulated, Kerosine is now deregulated but petrol has defied deregulation. Should we continue with this subsidy?\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government does not lack courage, our President does not lack political will.\n\n\u201c Who is really benefitting from subsidy? It is confusing. Some people are benefitting but certainly not the common man. Though it does not really benefit the common man, when you try to remove it, the common man comes out to defend it.\n\n\u201c Now, can we carry on with subsidy if you consider the amount of money swallowed by subsidy? If you want to carry on with subsidy, how do we get the money to fund it? The best way out is to take out subsidy because if we don\u2019t, we will continue to beg the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was practiced for a few months, but when the prices began to move up, some people started threatening and we had to return to it.\n\n\u201c This is a democracy and having deregulated for a few months, we had to step back because this government has listening ears,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe price differential is a major incentive for smuggling and it is very difficult to police the borders. We must find a way out of it; if not, you will continue to keep your price down in Nigeria while the neighbouring countries will continue to feed fat on subsidised fuel from Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe PIB is fully on course. We\u2019ve had many meetings with the National Assembly and other stakeholders. Although the National Assembly had earlier promised to pass it in April, but that did not work, I believe that the passage will not go beyond June,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the administration of President Buhari had attracted about $16.3billion Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the oil and gas sector.\n\nHe explained that the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline which had been on the drawing board will cost $21billion.\n\nHe said the Federal Government will soon disengage from managing refineries.\n\nThe refineries will either be handed over to Operation and Management Contractors (O and M) or allow Nigerians to decide if the government should sell them or go public at the stock exchange.\n\n\u201cThe refineries in Nigeria have been the weeping babies of the industry but we believe that it is important that they are at least made functional before we can say this is the direction to take.\n\n\u2018So if you have a dead refinery, how do you sell a corpse? It doesn\u2019t make sense. Some people say no it is a dead refinery, so why are they fixing it? So what am I going to do with it?\n\n\u201cIs it not better for me to at least resuscitate the dead refinery then look for the option of what to do with it? If I sell it, they will say he is selling a dead refinery but now you say let me resuscitate before selling and they say why are you resuscitating it? So whatever you do they will talk.\n\n\u201cThe so called dead refineries were sold by the administration of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, they shouted and it was reversed.\n\n\u201cSo now we said this time let\u2019s try and fix it and they said why? So you can see the dilemma.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is ensure that the refineries are functional and when it is, the first thing we want to do is not to run it as a government. We want to put an O and M contractor.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we will put out the advertisement for professional refinery managers to bid for managing it. So, it is not going to be subject to government issues anymore when it begins.\u201d",

Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe said across the world, conflicts and coronavirus have gone hand in hand.\n\nHe noted that as governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel, adding that terrorism is no common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n\u201cAround the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.

The world\u2019s spotlight will be on Nigeria in 2023. It needs to be a better election, not perfect but better to consolidate and improve Nigeria\u2019s democracy, and I think the Governor very much agree with me on that.\u201d\n\nThe envoy disclosed she had a very fruitful discussion with Governor Wike, and their discussion revolved around the economy, prospects of his vision including youth employment, challenges he is facing and his plans to tackle them.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of security, the High Commissioner said Britain is helping the Nigeria military to build its combat capacity in tackling insurgency, including Boko Haram in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to her, the British military has had its presence in Nigeria for several years and has continued to offer training on how to counter insurgency in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the North in particular, we are sharing our experiences in counter insurgency from Northern Ireland, from Iraq and from Afghanistan.

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, launched 300 mini busses tagged, the First and Last Mile Bus (FLM) Scheme as an alternative to commercial motorcycle popularly known as okada.\n\nThe new buses are expected to ply the inner routes in the six local government areas and nine local council development areas where okada have been banned. No fewer than 2,000 buses expected in the first phase of the project while total number of busses for the project is 5,000.\n\nThe governor, however, said the total ban on okada might not be enforced until another two months to give people enough time to get their cowry cards, gauge their response to the scheme, and also measure the scheme\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nAnother 100 High Capacity Buses were also unveiled by the governor. He described the initiatives as part of measures to address insecurity and provide Lagosians with safe, affordable and resilient commuting options.\n\nSanwo-Olu added that the initiatives were part of efforts to achieve a fully integrated inter-modal transport system.\n\nHe promised his administration was working to fulfil its campaign promises to the people. Commissioner for Transportation, Fredric Oladeinde, said the FLM launch was to reiterate the state\u2019s commitment to develop an integrated multi-modal transport system that is safe, comfortable, and support the people\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nManaging Director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, (LAMATA), Abimbola Akinajo, described the FLM scheme as part of the Bus Reform Initiative conceived to develop a coherent, formalised and regulated transport system and network in state.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe FLM is the last layer of the Bus Reform Initiative for Lagos State, which comes from the Lagos State Transport master plan developed by LAMATA. The Bus Reform Initiative is a plan by government to ensure that over time our public transportation system moves from an unregulated framework to a regulated framework.\u201d\n\nThe FLM scheme will be operated by private operators that will work with the state. The government will support them under a Bus Finance Scheme, where the private operator is expected to make a 20 percent down payment to be eligible to come under the scheme. The repayment period is for 36 months, with a 10 percent interest rate.",

          "title": "Analysts Differ on Buhari\u2019s Quest for Fresh N2.3tn External Loan",
          "text": "\u2022N\u2019Assembly considers request\n\n\u2022APC mortgaging nation\u2019s future, says PDP\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nFinancial analysts and the organised private sector yesterday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buhari: Insecurity grows propensity for conflict\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday launched a new operation to battle the rising insecurity in the South-east.\n\nHe also charged policemen in the region to be ruthless with secessionists.\n\nThe launch of the new security strategy, codenamed \u201cOperation RP\u201d is coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State was attacked and property burnt by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari said without security, economic opportunity would remain fragile and the propensity for conflict would grow, adding that military gains do not provide the whole solution.\n\nAlkali, at the launch of the operation in Enugu, charged policemen serving in the South-east region to deal ruthlessly with criminals and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing their will.\n\nHe urged policemen to be firm with criminals that may be threatening citizens within their area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe IG advised police personnel participating in the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police leadership and the entire nation are looking out for two major outcomes as you discharge your duties during this operation: first, to stabilise the security order in the South-east in the shortest possible time; second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the policemen to be civil with law-abiding citizens, respect the rights of the citizens and undertake the operation within the dictates of rule of law.\n\nHe, however, charged them to defend themselves against any armed group that might attempt to attack them, or any police assets and other critical national infrastructure.\n\nHe described the people of South-east as historically peaceful, tolerant, innovative, industrious and entrepreneurial, who are highly respected citizens that have made their marks in the field of academics, scientific inventions and commerce.\n\nHe, however, lamented that although the Igbo are a unique ethnic group that freely and peacefully lives with others across the country and within the South-east, the events of late had altered the positive narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence. This trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria police, military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 was conceptualised to ensure that \u201cwe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, expressed optimism that the operation would lead to the retooling of security architecture in the South-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s event could not have come at a better time than now giving the point of insecurity in the country. In the past week, we have been saddened by the spate of killings of security operatives in their line of duty and destruction of security infrastructure and other public institutions in Nigeria, especially in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that today\u2019s event will herald the rejigging and retooling of international security architecture in the South-east geopolitical zone to bring it up to speed with an emerging dimension of criminality.\u201d\n\nInsecurity Grows Propensity for Conflict\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned that without security, economic opportunity will remain fragile and the propensity for conflict will grow.\n\nHe also said that because of the post-COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and France must seize the chance to strengthen its economic and military ties.\n\nBuhari stated this in an article entitled: \u2018Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Nigeria and France Must Seize the Chance to Strengthen Military and Economic Ties,\u2019 published yesterday by a Paris-based magazine, Le Point.\n\nHe said across the world, conflict and coronavirus had not been far apart and the war against the coronavirus was one Nigeria was fully united with France in a strong determination to overcome.\n\nThe solution, according to him, therefore, is to improve those conditions, as it leaves the people vulnerable to indoctrination.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs governments have struggled to contain COVID-19, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cTerrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorists have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n\n\u201dWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation Occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe president said as the world emerges from COVID-19, there is a chance to rebuild.\n\n\u201cThough we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with the idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for all,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari stated that the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets.\n\nSaying in that context fate is generally linked, the president highlighted that Paris had been active in the common fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into a lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\n\u201dNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperation if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions.

          "text": "\u2022Says proceeds of marginal fields used to augment FAAC\n\nNdubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe federal government is weighing some options as discussions with Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell Petroleum Development Company, begin over its plan for total divestment from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday in Abuja listed three possible options being considered as comprising a takeover of the company\u2019s stake in the oil and gas industry by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); acquisition by indigenous operators and involving a mixture of local players and other foreign independent operators in the process.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy giant has been gradually selling its onshore assets for over a decade in Nigeria.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (JV) SPDC, had recently indicated it would no longer continue to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ben van Beurden, however, said yesterday that its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nHe also told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHowever, Sylva who fielded questions from journalists on the issue stated that while the federal government is in consultations with the oil giant on the divestment move.\n\n\u201cSome actually feel that Shell should not hurriedly divest and to at least stay,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhere Shell has completely divested from a sector is not good for us.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the executive arm is discussing with the National Assembly on the quick passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), saying that the bill will be passed lastest next month.\n\nSylva said: \u201cI want to tell you that PIB is fully on course and we are very happy because we have focused on that for a long time and we had many meetings with the National assembly and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cToday, I believe that we are all basically satisfied with where we are. The National Assembly has given a timeline. They actually gave April but a few things happened. But give or take, I still believe that the passage of the PIB will not go beyond June.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that between now and June, they will pass the PIB. I don\u2019t think we are far away with the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the nation\u2019s future lies in its vast gas reserves, which have been abandoned for decades, adding that the development of the huge gas potential will fast-track the diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cUnfortunately, what should have helped us are the laws around the oil industry and this has not happened over the last 20 years we have been tinkering with the laws. And yet, this law will power a lot of progress in this industry because the problem we have in the gas sector in Nigeria is that there are no clear fiscal regimes in the legal framework.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing the country\u2019s gas reserves which currently stands at 203 trillion TCF, will not only create jobs but also open more linkages with other sectors of the economy.\n\nSylva stated that the 203 trillion proven gas reserves were discovered in the course of oil exploration, adding that a conscious exploration could yield as much as 600 trillion tcf.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople have become more aware of the need for us to move towards gas. Last year, one of the first things we were able to achieve was the NLG Train7 final investment decision (FID) that has eluded the country for a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the development of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves, over $16.1billion has so far come into the country as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nHe added that the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation programme is fully on course, while the autogas policy is being finetuned in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which is to bring in conversion kits and make soft loans available for marketers to fit their filling stations.\n\nFor the policy to work effectively, he said there must be enough vehicles and filling stations.\n\nOn the recent judgement against Nigeria by a Milan court on the Malabu oil deal, the minister stated that the decision on the next move would depend on legal advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe minister also said the $1.5 billion required for the proposed rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery had been secured, adding that putting the refineries in shape was necessary before considering what options are better to run them, including using operations and management (O&M) experts.\n\nOn subsidy removal, Sylva said the federal government did not lack the courage or political will to float petrol price, but was considering stakeholders\u2019 views.\n\nHe stated that proceeds of the recent sale of marginal fields from Signature Bonuses were used to augment the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for April.\n\nOn reports in the social media that he collected $25 million from Saipem to award a contract in LNG Train 7, he said the contracted had already been awarded to Saipem before his appointment.\n\nShell CEO: Nigeria Onshore Oil Incompatible with Company\u2019s Climate Strategy\n\nOil multinational, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yesterday shed more light on its decision to divest from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe company said its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nThe company stated that it had been under increasing pressure from investors to slash emissions and pivot toward cleaner energy, even as the tension was on show at its shareholder meeting yesterday.\n\nBloomberg reported that while speaking at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe balance of risks and rewards associated with our onshore portfolio is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta and the company has started discussions with the government on how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say explicitly that Shell wanted to sell the remainder of its oil assets in the Niger Delta, nor did he provide a timetable.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term energy transition plan laid out to investors for the first time received overwhelming support, but a competing resolution asking for stricter targets also garnered more votes than ever.\n\nAdding to the tension, shareholders were meeting as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas developments needed to stop immediately for climate targets to be met.\n\nShell also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria, where it has been pumping out oil for half a century.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has been gradually selling onshore assets in Nigeria for more than a decade, as it sought to put aside chronic problems such as pollution caused by ruptured pipelines and the resulting legal battles with local communities.\n\nThe issue has become more acute in the past year after Shell pledged to transform itself into a clean energy giant and gradually winds down its oil and gas business to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nYet a full retreat would be an obvious endpoint to years of gradual divestment, even as Shell has reduced its total number of onshore licences in Nigeria by half over the past decade and has been focusing on offshore oil fields and gas operations in the country.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 meeting was dominated by investors\u2019 questions on Shell\u2019s climate strategy, ranging from pleas to set more ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels, to a request that the company \u201cstop apologising\u201d for the products it sells.\n\nWhen asked about an IEA\u2019s new report on stopping new oil and gas fields, Chairman, Chad Holliday, said Shell hadn\u2019t had time to study the report but would do so in due course.\n\nShell\u2019s energy transition plans, which forecast a big expansion in clean energy but also decades more oil and gas production, received nearly 89 per cent votes, while a competing proposal from the group rose to 30 per cent, more than double a year earlier.\n\nShare this:

They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him.

          "text": "A Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor, Abidemi Rufai, faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison regarding benefits paid in connection with a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York. He is scheduled for a detention hearing today (Wednesday).\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative.\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\"Greed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\" said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\"The FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he added.\n\nOgun State governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, Abiodun ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai, who is his close ally, because of the gravity of the allegation, Punch reports.\n\nThe statement read, \"The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has received the alarming news of the arrest of one of his political appointees, Mr Abidemi Rufai, in New York over alleged unemployment benefits fraud in the United States.\n\n\"Because of the gravity of these allegations, the governor has ordered the immediate suspension of the accused appointee. We will not condone any act bordering on criminality by anyone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State has described Rufai's arrest as an embarrassment.\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP in the state, Sikitullah Ogundele, said this in an interview with PUNCH Metro on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the arrest of Rufai showed that people of questionable characters were in the political system.\n\nOgundele stated, \"People of questionable character should be kept away from our system. Unfortunately, the governor of Ogun State has chosen somebody of dubious character, and it is an embarrassment to the entire state.\n\n\"It is not the fault of the person that appointed him, but personalities must be well-vetted before they are given appointments.\"",

          "text": "A Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor, Abidemi Rufai, faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison regarding benefits paid in connection with a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York. He is scheduled for a detention hearing today (Wednesday).\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative.\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\"Greed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\" said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\"The FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he added.\n\nOgun State governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, Abiodun ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai, who is his close ally, because of the gravity of the allegation, Punch reports.\n\nThe statement read, \"The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has received the alarming news of the arrest of one of his political appointees, Mr Abidemi Rufai, in New York over alleged unemployment benefits fraud in the United States.\n\n\"Because of the gravity of these allegations, the governor has ordered the immediate suspension of the accused appointee. We will not condone any act bordering on criminality by anyone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party in Ogun State has described Rufai's arrest as an embarrassment.\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP in the state, Sikitullah Ogundele, said this in an interview with PUNCH Metro on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the arrest of Rufai showed that people of questionable characters were in the political system.\n\nOgundele stated, \"People of questionable character should be kept away from our system. Unfortunately, the governor of Ogun State has chosen somebody of dubious character, and it is an embarrassment to the entire state.\n\n\"It is not the fault of the person that appointed him, but personalities must be well-vetted before they are given appointments.\"",

          "text": "It began like rain in the dry season: a light shower; a drizzle that was bound to return as quickly as it appeared. But it intensified, dropping with a consistency that pricked attention. Then it began to pour: an endless deluge that nothing could stop. This is no thunderstorm. It is Kelechi Iheanacho\u2018s goal-scoring form. A cloudburst of goals and quality performances that have ceased to halt since it cracked open earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has bagged a career-high 12 English Premier League (PL) goals in just 15 starts for Leicester City this season, winning the EPL player of the month for April in the process.\n\nSince March, nobody has matched his goal tally \u2014 11 goals. And on Tuesday, in a buzzing Stamford Bridge, under the weight of eyeballs of Chelsea fans, who were still boiling with a vengeance after Saturday\u2019s FA Cup loss, he demonstrated his cold-eyed brilliance in front of goal once again. With that, he etched his name in a pristine record as the first player to score at least an EPL goal every day of the week in a single season.\n\n7 \u2013 Kelechi Iheanacho is the first player in Premier League history to score a goal on all seven days of the week within a single season in the competition. Heaven. Advertisement \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 18, 2021\n\nHere is a breakdown of how he achieved that:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSunday, April 14\n\nLeicester 5-0 Sheffield United\n\nHere was the beginning of the resurgence \u2014 the time when his intermittent sparks finally kindled into a flame. Iheanacho bagged his first PL hat-trick. The partnership with Jamie Vardy began bearing the semblance of incoming positivity at this stage. The first goal came in the 39th minute as he stabbed the ball into the net from a curling cross by Vardy. The pairing also maintained their roles for Iheanacho\u2019s second goal. A blurry counterattack sent Vardy down the left before he skidded a cross into the path of the Nigerian, who rifled it beyond the reach of Aaron Ramsdale and into the net. His third came when he rammed a shot into the net from distance.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonday, April 26\n\nLeicester City 2-1 Crystal Palace\n\nA match-winner! Wilfred Zaha had given Palace an early lead, putting the Foxes on the back foot early into the game. A moment of brilliance from Timothy Castagne produced the equalizer and the winner seemed elusive. Then it arrived in style. From Leicester\u2019s half, John Evans sent an audacious, floating pass seeking Iheanacho as he dashed into space. The striker expertly tamed the launcher and turned two defenders inside out before powering the ball into a tight angle of Vicente Guaita\u2019s net.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday, May 19\n\nChelsea 2-1 Leicester City\n\nIt was a made-in-Nigeria goal! Wilfred Ndidi characteristically robbed the ball off Mateo Kovacic at the edge of Chelsea\u2019s box and threaded a through pass to Iheanacho, who had space and time to do what he had been doing for a while now. And he did it emphatically. He sent the ball beyond the sprawling arms of Edouard Mendy into the bottom corner. It was a case of too little, too late for the Foxes as the Pride Of London ran away the winner.\n\nHistory maker \ud83d\udc4f Advertisement Kelechi Iheanacho has become the first player in Premier League history to score a goal in all seven days of the week in the same season \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec#PL | #CHELEI pic.twitter.com/weTXIa6DOR \u2014 SuperSport \ud83c\udfc6 (@SuperSportTV) May 18, 2021\n\nWednesday, March 3\n\nBurnley 1-1 Leicester City\n\nAnother wonderful goal! Ndidi funneled Iheanacho a lobbing pass and he finished with a sumptuous left-footed volley that left Nick Pope gasping for air.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThursday, April 22\n\nLeicester 3-0 West Brom\n\nIt was a 16-minute floodgate of goals against West Brom. Goals from Vardy and Evans came in the 23rd and 26th minute respectively, while the former then turned provider for Iheanacho in the 39th minute. After a blitz in through the byline, Vardy fizzed the ball into the legs of the Nigerian, who readjusted deftly before slotting the ball into the top corner.\n\n\ufeff\n\nFriday, May 7\n\nLeicester 2-4 Newcastle United\n\nA consolation goal following a disappointing performance that threw the club\u2019s top-four hopes in peril. Regardless, the goal was a masterclass. He took the ball at the edge of the Newcastle box, surrounded by defenders, Iheanacho feinted and dazzled to create a space for himself and sent the ball flying past a stunned Martin D\u00fabravka into the top corner.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSaturday, March 6\n\nBrighton 1-2 Leicester City\n\nA defense-splitting pass from Youri Tielemans set Iheanacho up with only an on-rushing Robert S\u00e1nchez to beat. He scooped the ball delicately above the goalkeeper to drag Leicester level in the game before Daniel Amartey won the game in the 87th minute.",

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",

Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Healthtech startup, APEX Medical Labs, is helping Malawians get specialised diagnostic healthcare",
          "text": "Located in the South-Eastern region of Africa, Malawi has 83% of its population living in rural communities. This explains the strong dependence on the government for public amenities, including health facilities. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 67% of the country\u2019s healthcare is handled by the government, and the private sector barely takes care of the 1% left behind by non-profit organisations.\n\nDiagnosis is an important part of treatment, but existing facilities in the country do not have the capacity for certain medical tests, or the equipment is faulty when they are required. Consequently, some doctors do not suggest tests to patients; they would rather adopt alternative means or advise them to travel outside the country.\n\nIn 2017, two medical lab technologists, Kundai Moyo and Taziona Mzumara thought this shouldn\u2019t be and began working on a solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost of the specialised tests were being sent to South Africa or India. So we thought again to address this gap or rather have our population have access to these diagnostic services closer to home, and faster so that they also get quality services,\u201d explains Kundai Moyo, Co-founder and Operations Director at APEX Medical Laboratories.\n\nMoyo\u2019s understanding of the situation came from her 16 years of practice and the opinions of some doctors.\n\n\u201cWe did a survey among some of the doctors, we noted that most of the time they don\u2019t use laboratory services, not because they don\u2019t need them but because they are not available, or most of the time they are faulty,\u201d she adds.\n\nEstablishing a niche\n\nAt first, the Malawi market appeared to be unripe for such an intervention considering the small population that visits private hospitals. Of this number, there\u2019s even a smaller fraction who can afford the service. But Moyo soon realised that it could be used to the startup\u2019s advantage.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on those that can pay, but I think there are other opportunities. For example, public-private partnerships, and also to expand to other cities, especially for the tests that are unique to us because we have tests we\u2019ve introduced in Malawi that have not been there. No one else is providing them currently,\u201d she boasts.\n\nBut first, she had to build the necessary capacity.\n\nBefore getting their first client in July 2018, Moyo got admitted into the African Women Entrepreneurship Cooperative to learn the basis for entrepreneurship for three months. She considers this knowledge invaluable to the progress the startup has made.\n\nIt was within the same period that the startup got the business certification, and the founders bootstrapped funds to secure a space. They also got their first set of test equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all this in place, the startup devised different means to tackle the challenge by making sure it is at the client\u2019s convenience.\n\n\u201cAt APEX, we are driven by this and want to make sure that we bring a cooperative service that is unique to Malawi and to prevent the sending of clients samples outside the country to India or South Africa. But at the same time bring a unique service that our clients can be served in their home or at the doctor of their choice without being moved from one clinic to the other,\u201d Moyo notes.\n\nNow, APEX Medical Laboratories not only focuses on people who walk into the facility to request tests. It also targets private practising doctors, public and private hospitals, health insurance companies, and health organisations.\n\nInterestingly, feedback from all these entities has been encouraging.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s only about 20% or less that walk into the facility. 80% come from outside \u2014 referred from clinics, doctors, private doctors, and hospitals and organisations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Moyo, the startup now boasts of servicing 3,000 individuals from 30 clinics, 3 health organisations, and several private doctors.\n\nBut achieving this wasn\u2019t easy. At the start, it involved convincing hospitals and health centres of its services. Finally, the startup strategically located a lab within another facility as a form of partnership.\n\n\u201cWe have other agreements with these big hospitals that don\u2019t have those particular services they want us to provide\u2014for example, HIV Virology PCR. We have an agreement with them that all their clients for this particular test, they direct to us,\u201d Kundai reveals.\n\nThis arrangement also applies to some health insurance companies that would have normally suggested tests for their clients abroad.\n\nBespoke service delivery\n\nDepending on the test requested from the 86 medical tests that APEX Medical Laboratories offers, a client may have to spend between $5 and $100.\n\nFor its mobile (on the road) and home test services, the lab receives requests through messaging platforms like its website, social media platform, and WhatsApp \u2014 where it can track the location of a client.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has grown steadily.\n\n\u201cIn terms of growth, I think we were growing even when we weren\u2019t making a profit. From 2018 to 2019, I think we did like 300%; 2019 to 2020, about 400%; and then 2020 to 2021, about 95% growth.\u201d\n\nGoing by this, Moyo says the startup is making up to $15,000 in monthly revenue but only started making a profit in 2020.\n\nOn how the business has handled demand \u2014 even other laboratories outsource to the startup \u2014 the startup has enjoyed a few external fundings.\n\nPost-revenue in 2019, the startup participated in the Growth Accelerator Malawi entrepreneurship challenge and won a $48,000 grant. In 2020, it bagged $16,000 in grants from the Malawi Entrepreneurship COVID Challenge. It has also gained exposure through a program organised by Africa-focused publication, Yale African Startup Review (YASR).\n\nFor now, the startup only operates in Malawi\u2019s capital city, Lilongwe. However, as it grows in capacity and gets more funds, it plans to expand to Blantyre by June 2021.\n\nLeveraging other tech solutions\n\nApart from the basic test equipment, the startup has acquired machines adapted for more than one test.\n\nIn 2020, for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic when the government authorised the startup to carry out COVID-19 tests, the lab adapted the HIV testing equipment for COVID-19 tests.\n\nAsides from that, APEX Medical Laboratories has also adopted a data information software.\n\n\u201cWhat we call the laboratory information management system or ELDS where we have the information for the client, what kind of condition they have, who the doctor requesting is, and what kind of test, then their result,\u201d Moyo describes.\n\nWith time, doctors referring patients to the lab can quickly access the medical history of new and returning clients. The founder says the startup plans to strongly leverage this in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are using it to understand the diseases because you\u2019ll be responding to the needs of the client in terms of what services we need to focus on, which is important for the different population,\u201d she adds.\n\nApart from the ease this brings to clients, the system is also helping the business with proper documentation and service delivery.\n\nWhile the startup works towards growing its team beyond six specialists, it plans to expand into other African countries before the end of 2024.\n\nAs it is, Moyo and her team plan to keep evolving to grow the brand further. She believes this is possible given the conducive business environment that the country provides, especially for female entrepreneurs.\n\nFeatured image credit: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nEmmanuel and Chimgozirim here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nNew or not so new logistics regulations\n\nUber, Lagos, and lost items\n\nThe race to build Africa\u2019s crypto infrastructure\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s 2021 investment so far\n\nNew? logistics regulations in Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian government has approved what seems to be new regulations for the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). It also approved a rulemaking process which, it states, would establish NIPOST as a regulator in the logistics sector.\n\nThe rule is termed: The Courier and Logistics Services (Operations) Regulations and will provide a regulatory framework for Nigeria\u2019s logistics sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. In 2020, NIPOST released a regulation with the same name but to huge backlash and outrage. The regulations increased licencing fees for logistics operators, and they were also required to remit 2% of their revenue to the NIPOST.\n\nDespite the fact that NIPOST regulations are subject to Ministerial approval, Dr Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s ICT minister feigned ignorance at the rules and ordered NIPOST to back down.\n\nWhat has changed? The government only stated that it has approved new regulations, but no details have been revealed yet. Have the controversial provisions been removed? How will this impact the logistics sector?\n\nLet\u2019s dive into this rabbit hole later today. It should be interesting.\n\nWhat have you lost lately on Uber?\n\nHave you been in the city of Lagos on a typical Monday morning? You would likely find it doused with the smell of vehicle exhaust and the desperation of commuters.\n\nYou think you\u2019re lucky: You ordered an Uber so you don\u2019t have to jump Danfos (commercial yellow buses), but guess what, no one is safe. You would still have to chill in hot traffic.\n\nNo surprise then when Uber stated that Lagosians are the most guilty of forgetting items at the end of their trips. And it happens the most on, you guessed it, Mondays and Sundays.\n\nSome of the items forgotten include the regular culprits like keys and wrist watches but also things you wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to forget like cameras and laptops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, you could retrieve these items\u2026.hopefully.\n\nCheck back later today to find out what other items people left behind.\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s 2021 investment\n\nNigeria\u2019s Future Africa fund says it has invested $3 million in 13 African startups so far in 2021, double the investments made in 2020. Founded by serial entrepreneur, Iyin Aboyeji in 2020, Future Africa is on a mission to provide early-stage funding for African innovators.\n\nMore funding for female-led startups: Earlier this year, Iyin stated the firm\u2019s desire to invest at least $1 million in female founders. Going by the announcement, it would seem that the goal has been reached. While they declined to mention all startups that have been funded, of the four mentioned, we can confirm that Lami has a woman on its founding team.\n\nCan you take advantage of this? For a yearly subscription fee of $1000, individuals can take part in funding Africa\u2019s future where they can invest a minimum of $5000 yearly. Limited Partners can invest up to $25,000 yearly.\n\nWe go into more detail here.\n\nMore African founders are getting involved in providing early-stage funding for African entrepreneurs. Piggyvest co-founder Odunayo Eweniyi and Endeavor Nigeria MD, Eloho Omame recently launched a fund for female founders. Iroko TV founder Jason Njoku has also been involved in providing funds for entrepreneurs through SPARK and later Investzilla.\n\nAfrica\u2019s crypto Infrastructure\n\nNot long ago, I had a series of interviews with several crypto startup founders. At the time, it seemed like every time I checked my inbox, there would always be a crypto startup pitching a story. To be honest, it felt strange and intriguing.\n\nThose series of interviews helped me understand the space and gave birth to some interesting stories. Like how Nigerian youth dominate the crypto surge, how the Nigerian government could leverage it for growth, how to think about regulations, and several exciting use cases for crypto.\n\nA clear pattern: A major gap we noticed was a clear dearth of blockchain, and by extension, crypto infrastructure.\n\nFor crypto startups to thrive, there has to be a technology infrastructure powering it, and most of them starting out have to get liquidity (enough cash to power through the early stages).\n\nQuidax, one of Nigeria\u2019s earliest exchanges, launched in 2017 at a time when crypto was only a whisper and a tale for most Nigerians.\n\nWe had a chat with CEO Buchi Okoro on the company\u2019s journey which started from building trust in WhatsApp groups to creating an exchange that currently averages nearly a billion dollars worth of yearly transactions.\n\nRead: Nigerian crypto startup, Quidax, is building Africa\u2019s crypto infrastructure one major market at a time\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHomzmart raises $15m\n\nSeriously, Egyptian startups need to show everyone the secret. This is the third funding round of over a million dollars in the MENA region this week. Co-founded by Mahmoud Ibrahim, COO of Daraz and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics, Jumia, the startup has secured $15 million to build its furniture marketplace. There\u2019s more.\n\nEgypt-based last-mile delivery company, Bosta, raises $6.4m Series A. Read\n\nSafaricom\u2019s end of fiscal year report shows an increase in Internet data revenue.

          "title": "Pension contributors navigate maze of PFAs for better returns",
          "text": "The quest for higher returns and better service delivery are driving mass movement of pension contributors to other Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) under the newly approved transfer window.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that PFAs that have remained conservative, sluggish in carrying their contributors and retirees along in terms of engagement and communications are largely being affected.\n\nAccording to latest figures released by the National Pension Commission (PenCom), the number of contributors that have moved has risen by 353 percent to a total of 12,681 in the Transfer Quarter that ended March 31, 2021, from a total number of 2,799 Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders in the maiden Transfer Quarter that ended December 31, 2020.\n\nPenCom says the number more than quadrupled in the last transfer quarter, and expect consistently upward trend, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs.\n\n\u201cOverall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry,\u201d the industry regulator states.\n\nMost of the movement is happening in RSA FUND II, which is the default fund for all Active Contributors who are below 50 years old, an industry source says.\n\nThe PenCom notes in a statement that the launching of the RSA Transfer System (RTS) on November 16, 2020, heralded the full implementation of one of the cardinal features of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), the portability of RSAs.\n\nRead Also: Pension operators partner AVCA to empower local investors on private equity\n\n\u201cBy this development, RSA holders have been empowered to move their RSAs from their current PFAs to other PFAs of their choice, whenever they desire to do so,\u201d it notes.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the opening of the \u2018Transfer Window,\u2019 as it is popularly referred to, has been embraced by a large number of RSA holders in their quest for better service delivery and returns on investment from PFAs.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has ensured that the requirements for initiating RSA transfers are minimal, and has also been made available on its website, necessary information to guide RSA holders through the process. Specifically, its publication of the \u2018Frequently Asked Questions\u2019 on RSA transfers, provides RSA holders with all they need to know about RTS.\n\n\u201cThe RTS is a fully automated, efficient and transparent process that has pre-defined timelines. It ensures hassle free movement of RSAs across PFAs,\u201d Commission.\n\nAs the transfer of RSAs involves movement of pension assets between PFAs, the entire process attracts the full weight of the Commission\u2019s regulatory surveillance, the PenCom notes. The fact that the process has been completely free of charge has also given RSA holders an added advantage, it states.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming response by RSA holders to the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is, therefore, not surprising. In the maiden Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 December 2020, a total number of 2,799 RSA holders transferred their RSAs to various PFAs. This number more than quadrupled in the next Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 March 2021, as a total number of 12,681 RSA transfers took place,\u201d the Commission discloses.\n\nAccording to Olumide Oyetan, chief executive, Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers, in an interview with BusinessDay recently, the transfer window is a positive development for the pension industry as it gives RSA holders the freedom to change their initial selection of a PFA to their preferred service provider based on attributes that are important to them.\n\n\u201cFor us as a company, the transfer window has given us the opportunity to welcome new clients and continually improve our technology and services to meet most of our clients\u2019 needs,\u201d he said.\n\nLeveraging our various educative programmes, the transfer window also gives us the opportunity to enlighten a wider audience, thereby boosting confidence in the Nigerian pension industry as well as the larger financial services industry, he stated.\n\nIbrahim Alhassan Babayo, chairman, Board of Directors, Premium Pensions Limited, said during the company\u2019s annual general meeting that the long-awaited Transfer Window had shifted power to the contributors as they now have the opportunity to switch from one PFA to another.\n\nThe opportunities to move when dissatisfied have an implication on Assets under Management (AUM), though reported that Premium Pension Limited was a net gainer during the maiden Transfer Window quarter, he said.\n\nA consistently upward trend is anticipated, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs. Overall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Act that established the Scheme, the objectives of this scheme is to ensure that every person who worked in either the public service of the Federation, Federal Capital Territory, states and local government or the private sector receives his retirement benefits as and when due; and to assist improvident individuals by ensuring that they save in order to cater for their livelihood during old age.\n\nIn the case of the private sector, the Scheme shall apply to employees who are in the employment of an organisation in which there are three or more employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the provision of subsection (2) of this section, employee of organisation with less than three employees as well as self-employed persons shall be entitled to participate under the scheme in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission.",

          "text": "As coronavirus closed businesses around the world and forced millions to stay home, Nigeria\u2019s film industry produced more local movies in 2020 compared to previous four years.\n\nThe arrival of the deadly COVID-19 alongside a nationwide lockdown led to a halt in film and TV productions, costing estimated tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings. However, film producers tried to focus on high-quality movies, growing cinema audiences, as lockdown was eased, and the likes of Netflix pushed to tap into the country\u2019s over 200 million population.\n\nDespite COVID-19 challenges, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show the number of movies produced surged by 477.6 percent to 2,599 in 2020, the highest when compared to 450 movies in 2017. In 2018 and 2019, it produced 565 and 700 movies, respectively\n\nThe NBS data also show that the number of movies produced in quarter one of 2021 stood at 416, almost close to what was made in 2017.\n\nBy location, Lagos had the highest with 149, closely followed by Onitsha with 140 movies, Benin City and Bauchi recorded two movies each, respectively. From the record, data were provided by the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) and verified and validated by the NBS.\n\nExperts in the movie industry have said that the challenges surrounding COVID-19 triggered a new height of creativity among Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cThe fact that more movies were produced in a disruptive year 2020 signals the resilience of the sector, and also highlights that the sector is gradually living up to its potentials,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nRead Also: Eyimofe to premiere in Nigerian cinemas after success at world\u2019s film festivals\n\nSamuel Oniyitan, a movie producer, says the lockdown period provided the time and a little sense of sanity for most of them to write different stories, noting, \u201cBefore the lockdown, we really don\u2019t have much time to write enough stories.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative industry is one of the most vibrant in Africa. In recent years, the sector has seen a period of rapid progress facilitated by emerging digital technology, which supports content creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC Nigeria), Nollywood, the second largest film producer in the world, contributed 2.3 percent to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2016. The industry is reported to generate between $500 million and $1 billion annually and is usually busy towards the end of the year.\n\nLast year, Nigerian cinemas closed for six months had to depend on quality local movie content from Nollywood to stay afloat because of the drop in foreign contents.\n\nNollywood took advantage of the lack of foreign content by releasing quality local contents like Omo Ghetto, Fate of Alakada, Quam\u2019s Money, Dear Affy, Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story, Who\u2019s the Boss, This Lady Called Life, Voiceless, \u00ccf\u00e9, Introducing The Kujus, that glued the Nigerian audience to various online platforms during the lockdown and the cinemas across the country, when lockdown was eased.\n\nIn order to increase its less than 50,000 Nigerian subscribers, last year, Netflix, a global on-demand movie streaming company increased its Nollywood originals on its video streaming platform and also collaborated with Nollywood directors and producers to churn out more local Netflix originals.\n\nRobert Onyeri, a professional filmmaker, says young filmmakers are doing a phenomenal job in reinventing the Nollywood wheel, breaking from the norm, crafting fresh narratives and style on how we tell our stories. \u201cIt would do Nollywood a lot of good to foster and not stifle these young filmmakers,\u201d he states.\n\nDespite the growth in movie production, stakeholders have lamented the insufficient support from the present administration as against the previous President Goodluck Jonathan administration that set up the Nigerian Creative and Entertainment Industry Stimulation $200 million Loan Scheme meant to address major issues in the industry \u2013 distribution, capacity building and content production.\n\n\u201cThere is no funding and structure in place. Goodluck did it and it worked because many people benefited from it,\u201d an official from Filmone Cinemas says.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDue to what it described as low registration figures, the National Examinations Council (NECO) has postponed its national common entrance examination (NCEE) earlier scheduled to hold on May 29.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued on Wednesday morning by the examination body and signed on its behalf by the head of information and public relations division, Azeez Sani.\n\nMr Sani gave the new date as June 5, saying the decision was approved by the federal ministry of education.\n\nReason for postponement\n\nAccording to the spokesman, the figures of applicants recorded so far are lower than expected. NECO, however, hopes that the one-week extension will provide opportunities for more candidates to apply.\n\n\u201cThe Examination which was initially scheduled for Saturday 29th May, 2021, was rescheduled to give states with low registration of candidates the opportunity to register their candidates for the examination,\u201d the statement reads in part.\n\nIt added that the registration of candidates would continue until the new examination date.\n\nThough the examination body did not give the current figure of applicants, PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the figure currently stands at about 50,000.\n\nThis is low compared to 70,580 candidates that registered for the examination in 2020, though more than 16,713 candidates could not sit the examination due to the nationwide protests against police brutality ravaging the nation at the time.\n\nThe examination, which usually holds between May and June, was postponed to October last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNECO has, therefore, appealed to stakeholders to encourage more pupils to register for the examination.\n\n\u201cCandidates, parents and guardians are advised to download the new Examination Time Table from the Council\u2019s website: www.neco.gov.ng,\u201d NECO urged.\n\nAbout NCEE\n\nThe national common entrance examination (NCEE) is a qualifying examination into Nigeria\u2019s 104 federal unity colleges.\n\nIt is one of the national examinations being conducted by NECO. Others include the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) both internal and external diets, and Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).",

How can many of us cope with these terrible situations?\n\n\u201cMany of us are widows, in fact, we are really suffering.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari in Paris, France, has called on European countries and global financial institutions to consider reducing devastating effect of the coronavirus pandemic on African economies by restructuring debt portfolios, opting for complete reliefs, and releasing vaccines to the continent, which is still behind in protecting majority of its citizens.\n\nThe President, who spoke at the Financing Africa Summit held at Grande Palais Ephemere with the theme: \u2018External Financing and debt Treatment,\u2019 said the fall in commodity prices as COVID-19 took a toll on the global economy further slowed growth in some countries and strained health facilities.\n\n\u201cIt is in this vein that we solicit the support of the French government with its influence in the European Union to lend its voice to the efforts being made to mobilize additional resources for developing economies most especially Africa in order to strengthen the quantum of investments to our economies. This financial support should also be extended to the private sector,\u201d he said, accordingly to a press statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, on Tuesday.\n\nThe President said the European Union should encourage fair and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in less developed countries, and promote the establishment of manufacturing facilities.\n\nAccording to him, many African countries were already experiencing debt distress and the Debt Service Suspension by France and G-20 does not go far enough, adding that there was need for more sustainable and affordable financing solutions, including debt relief and further debt restructuring.\n\nOn the Paris Agreement for Climate Change, President Buhari noted that African countries would need financial support for green energy investment and COP-26.\n\nHe said Nigeria will refocus on gas, while adopting a Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative.\n\nOn the theme, \u2018Africa Private Sector \u2014 Reforms \u2013 Infrastructure\u2019, the President said Public Private Partnership (PPP) will be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe government intends to leverage on Public Private Partnership to bolster its job creation, and anti-corruption drive. In terms of job creation, Nigeria has an abundant labour force since 30.5 percent of its population is between the ages of 25 and 54,\u2019\u2019 Buhari added.",

          "text": "For demonstrating his love and patriotism to Nigeria during his club FA Cup triumph at the Wembley Stadium on Saturday, National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) has instituted an arts contest in honour of Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nThe Super Eagles striker and his compatriot Wilfred Ndidi were part of history-making on Saturday, May 15, 2021, as their club, Leicester City, beat hard-fighting Chelsea to win the 2021 English FA Cup.\n\nThe duo celebrated the feat enthusiastically with a Nigeria flag, with Iheanacho soaked in love for his country, wrapped himself in Nigerian green-white-green national colour.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Director-general of NCAC and president World Crafts Council, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, described the show of love for one country by Iheanacho as an uncommon display of patriotism that must not go uncelebrated.\n\nHe said Iheanacho\u2019s action speaks of Nigeria as a great nation with great people, noting that with all eyes on the former Manchester City star, he was telling the world \u2018Yes we can\u2019 and with us \u2018it is possible\u2019.\n\n\u201cBeneath the pomp, glitz and glamour of the English FA Cup final between Chelsea and Leicester City, a unique, spectacular and outstanding show of patriotism was on display. It came in the manner of Kelechi Iheanacho, the big boy of Leicester City FC, soaked in love for Nigeria. Fully wrapped himself in Nigerian green-white-green national colour to celebrate Leicester success.\n\n\u201cYou all agree with me that in most cases we were all worried that a lot of people would leave this country and give us bad names, bad impressions etc. But this is one special occasion where Nigeria\u2019s flag was celebrated and wrapped for victory, beamed for the whole world for a right reason.\n\n\u201cHonestly on that day, I feel proud to be a Nigerian because this did not only happen, but in front of over two thousand cameras beaming it for the whole world and Nigeria\u2019s colours were celebrated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat is why today, we come out with this sports and culture, a brand to promote Nigeria at international fora. If we have been doing this a lot of Nigerians would remember that if they do well they\u2019ll be celebrated.\n\n\u201cSo, we decided that this is a unique occasion that we must quickly celebrate Kelechi Iheanacho for telling the world that Nigeria can do it and even do it better. He has shown that he is a true ambassador of our great country.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique opportunity of telling the world our story by ourselves. If you remember during the world cup in 1959 which was a fantastic outing, the then great player for Brazil was celebrated all over the continent after the match. This time we want to make a statement and with the collaboration of the Society of Nigeria Artists (SNA), Abuja chapter, the Council is instituting an arts contest that celebrates intersection of sports and culture referencing Kelechi Iheanacho celebration with the Nigerian flag in the Leicester City in FA Cup over Chelsea,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the contest which is only open to Abuja artists because of the time limit will see the artist with the best artistic impression of Iheanacho wrapped with Nigerian flag and carrying a Nigerian basketball on his head smile home with N300, 000 and will be presented to the minister of Information and Culture and his counterpart in Sports.\n\n\u201cWe want to come up with an artistic impression of Iheanacho that will be sent to our galleries and showcase all-over the world for doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cI like to tell you that one of our disconnects is that we don\u2019t celebrate our best, which is dangerous, this will be a new chapter we want to open. Some of these artists will come up with artistic impressions of Iheanacho and it is going to be a contest whereby the best three entries will win awards.\n\n\u201cWe will have some jurists to identify the best, second, third and possibly the fourth of these pictures and it will be celebrated all-over Nigeria, particularly during our NAFEST 2021 coming up in Ekiti,\u201d Runsewe stated.",

We are looking to deploy air surveillance across the state in terms of using drones, we can also collaborate in this area, as we see security as an important part of our administration,\u201d Abiodun added.\n\nHe disclosed that his administration was awaiting the donation of about six ambulances before the end of the week, saying his administration is also waiting patiently for the Czech Government to deliver on its promise to donate ambulances to the state.\n\n\u201cWe are anxiously waiting for those ambulances you promised us. When we assumed office, there were only five ambulances in the state, today, we have twenty ambulances. I think somebody else is donating about maybe five, six ambulances sometimes this week, so, we have about twenty-six. We aim to have about thirty-five to forty ambulances because we want to have one ambulance per state constituency and we have twenty-six of such constituencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to provide enough ambulances to make that operational, we are providing ambulances in the primary health care centers, tricycle ambulances for pregnant women in that neighborhood, we are rehabilitating the centers so that they give our people the confidence. At the end of this month, we should have about a hundred of those in place, which is about five per local government, we are hoping to do two-hundred and thirty-six between now and the end of next year.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that once we have our Primary Health Care Centers in place, we can launch our health care Insurance Programme as well,\u201d Abiodun submitted.\n\nAlso speaking, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, commended the Czech Republic Government for its numerous support to the state.\n\nShe disclosed that the medical equipment would be installed in Ijebu-Ife, one of the local communities visited by Ambassador Skolil.",

          "text": "A Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor, Abidemi Rufai, faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison when it relates to benefits paid in connection with a presidentially-declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday May 15, 2021, in New York. He is scheduled for a detention hearing today (Wednesday).\n\n\u201cSince the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals, who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania, and used variations of a single e-mail address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nBy using this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as \u2018Green Dot\u2019 accounts, or wired to bank accounts controlled by \u2018money mules\u2019. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai\u2019s relative.\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\u201cGreed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\u201d said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news, and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.

Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday May 15, 2021, in New York. He is scheduled for a detention hearing today (Wednesday).\n\n\u201cSince the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals, who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania, and used variations of a single e-mail address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nBy using this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as \u2018Green Dot\u2019 accounts, or wired to bank accounts controlled by \u2018money mules\u2019. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai\u2019s relative.\n\nLaw enforcement determined that more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\u201cGreed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers,\u201d said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Seattle.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programmes meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, in his reaction, described the arrest as disturbing news, and ordered the immediate suspension of Rufai.

          "text": "The industrial action that has grounded Kaduna state may be far from being over as Governor Nasir el-Rufai ordered the sack of nurses below Grade Level 14 and Kaduna State University (KASU) lecturers who joined the strike.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai also declared the labour leaders as bandits, describing their actions as equivalent of banditry, kidnapping and other security challenges facing the state.\n\nHe also declared wanted NLC President Ayuba Wabba and some leaders of the group for breach of public peace and related offences.\n\nMr. Wabba, the body\u2019s acting general secretary, Comrade Bende Ismail, Vice Presidents, Najeem Yasin and Amaechi Asigiri and Comrade Joe Ajaero among other NLC top guns, led the peaceful protest from its state secretariat to Kaduna state House of Assembly Monday where Wabba gave a speech on why they shutdown Kaduna.\n\nThe decision followed the commencement of NLC\u2019s five-day warning strike and protest that shut down economic and social activities in Kaduna state Monday, literally grounding the state to a halt with the airport, train station, banks, government offices, institutions, filling stations and electricity all shut down.\n\nSpeaking in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, Governor el-Rufai lamented that some nurses engaged in sabotage of some health facilities to join the strike, adding that many nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\nThe governor singled out three nurses of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, who he said the state would prosecute for allegedly disconnecting the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said the health ministry had been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed, warning that any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action. Today, the Kaduna state government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private businesses whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government. KDSG regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021. The names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby.\n\n\u201cIn addition, KDSG has decided the following: Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna state, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty. The Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed;\n\n\u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education. All MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends: trying to hold hostage the freedoms, economic interests, livelihoods and resources of the people of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not submit its treasury to the entitled minority. We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna state even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum. The government remains committed to providing social services beyond paying salaries, always putting the interests of the many ahead of the few,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nFurther to that, the governor promised handsome reward for anybody who knows the whereabouts of Wabba and other NLC leaders declared wanted.\n\nEl-Rufai who posted the declaration Tuesday on his verified Twitter handle @elrufai, said the labour leaders were wanted for economic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nThe governor\u2019s tweet Tuesday morning read: \u201cKADUNA UPDATE: Ayuba Wabba & others of @NLCHeadquarters declared wanted for economic sabotage & attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act. Anyone that knows where he is hiding should send a message to @MOJKaduna. KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!\u201d\n\nArmed thugs attack workers\n\nMeanwhile, a group of thugs suspected to be sponsored by the state government Tuesday attacked labour leaders and workers during the peaceful protest.\n\nThe attacked happened shortly after the governor left the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), adjacent where the workers assembled, with heavily armed security personnel to forcefully install power installation.\n\nThe armed thugs came in a bus brought series of weapons like stick, bottles, stones and machetes.\n\nThe thugs were however overpowered by both workers and security personnel at the venue of the protest.\n\nBlueprint can also report that some of the security personnel who were seen in groups discussing, said the government was planning to declare curfew in the state.\n\nThey described the action as \u201cuncivilised and barbaric \u201c, stressing that the workers were peaceful and orderly which should be commended.\n\nSome workers who tried to confront the thugs while throwing stones were stopped by the labour leaders, while the detachment of security men, police , civil defence, military men, and the Road Safety, who were on ground approached the thugs and tried to persuade and appeal to them.\n\nThe defiant thugs, despite the appeal by security personnel, started throwing stones, and attempt to disperse them with teargas was initially unsuccessful as their actions disrupted the rally before the thugs were finally dispersed by the workers themselves, without any casualty.\n\nWhen the situation was brought under control, Comrade Wabba briefly addressed the workers to end the rally with a promise to use all labour actions available to confront the state government.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the NLC president said the congress was fully aware of the plan by the state governor to unleash thugs on them, and had as early as Tuesday morning shared the information and the clips of the plan with all the security agencies.\n\nHe pointed out that the military, SSS, Police, Civil Defence were all notified earlier and were aware of the plans, alleging the governor himself led the thugs.\n\n\u201cWe said it in the morning. We mentioned the name of the person that was contracted. We mentioned the thugs that will be coming and I told all the security agencies, I called the DSS, I called the police, I told them that this is the credible information we have. We have the clips. This clip was trending since 6 am in the morning.\n\n\u201cThey had the meeting in the night and we shared our intelligence with the Police and the DSS. We were fully aware and that was why we informed the security agencies because it is the role of the security agencies to provide security cover for any protest.\n\n\u201cAnd you saw, he was the person that led the thugs because he came and entered NEPA office (Kaduna Electric) before the thugs came. Our workers wanted to go but we said no. He led them before they came and tried to unleash mayhem, but we thank God that our people were also good in number and they were chased away,\u201d he said.\n\nPower sector under threat\n\nBut the workers had threatened to escalate the power outage nationwide by Friday, if governors failed to advise El-Rufai to dialogue with the workers.\n\nSpeaking, a Deputy President of NLC and General Secretary of Nigeria Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), Comrade Ajaero, said the power blackout would go national from Friday, if the situation remains the same and El-Rufai refused to do the needful.\n\n\u201cThe NLC had warned earlier that if after the five-day warning strike, the state governor failed to address the issues, workers across the country would join in solidarity and commence a nationwide strike.\n\n\u201cThey said we are declared wanted and we are in the streets of Kaduna. Let me make this clear, there is decision of power \u2013 the executive, the judiciary and the legislator.\n\n\u201cNo Executive governor can declare anybody wanted. The police can do that, the courts can give order. Any executive Governor that is announcing that doesn\u2019t know his job, there is separation of powers between the three arms of Government so in furtherance to the illegality being perpetrated by El-Rufai , is the power of the police and the court to declare someone wanted .\n\n\u201cNow, El-Rufai is an illegal governor all his actions and pronouncements are embedded in illegality so we are here the action is on, the strike is on. Rather than go into issue of negotiation, he has resulted to harassment and intimidation. Last night he tried to use force to enter power installation to install power. Let me say this under the Constitution- Sections 1&2 made it clear the supremacy of the constitution.\n\nSection 40 gives us freedom movement, freedom of association as well as freedom to protest and we are not going to violate any law.\n\n\u201cWe are going to perform our trade union function to the best of our knowledge. And for your information, power is under the exclusive list; el Rufai has no business to say anything about power. The state government is under concurrent list. So, everyone should mind his powers. Comrades, I want to urge all of you to stay firm. So, for some of us in the power sector, if by tomorrow or next nothing happens, we are ready to escalate it to the whole country, we want to send a message to the chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) that if they don\u2019t advise El-Rufai on this issue, they would feel also the power outage.\u201d\n\nThe peaceful rally which commenced as usual from the NLC state secretariat where the workers were earlier addressed by the NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, and passed through the secretariat through to the popular NEPA Junction along Ahmadu Bello Way, before the thugs arrived in two small buses, jumped down with sticks to confront the Labour leaders.\n\nBlueprint reports that as a t the time of this report, the Kaduna metropolis still remained deserted with all businesses under lock and key.\n\nAPC govs beg\n\nAnd from the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) came a plea that Governor El-Rufai should negotiate with the striking workers.\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Kebbi state, Abubakar Bagudu, made the plea in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe PGF has been following unfolding development between NLC and Kaduna State government over the issue of rightsizing local government employees with deep concerns.\n\n\u201cNoting all the challenges facing all our states, especially given dwindling revenue, we appeal to all patriotic Nigerians, including the NLC, to demonstrate more commitment toward engaging governments at all levels to address problems.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle-flexing,\u201d Mr Bagudu said, saying Nigerians were already overstretched with many challenges.\n\n\u201cAt this critical point of our democratic journey, there could not be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens.\u201d\n\nHe said that every step must be taken to resolve the face-off between the state government and NLC.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to NLC leadership to recognise that the burden of leadership is more about responding to challenges based on the honest disposition of correcting past mistakes.\n\n\u201cAs progressive governors, we share the vision of Kaduna State government of reforming all our local government councils to make them more efficient and consequently the pivot of critical development initiatives.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we want to appeal to the state government under the leadership of our colleague, Malam Nasir El-Rufai to take all necessary steps to ensure the resolution of all disagreements in the larger interest of citizens in Kaduna state,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bagudu expressed confidence that both the state government and NLC would resolve all outstanding issues and restore industrial harmony in the state.\n\nNAN\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "2021 budget deficit: Buhari seeks NASS\u2019 nod to raise N2.343trn loan",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded to the National Assembly a request for an approval to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848 trillion from multilateral and bilateral lenders, to finance the deficit of N5.602 trillion in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe amount which is equivalent to USD$6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD$1/N379, is captured as part of the N4.666 trillion External Borrowing plans proposed and approved through the passage of the N13.8 trillion 2021 budget.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter addressed to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives, and read during plenary.\n\nAccording to the president, the request was made in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment) Act, 2003.\n\nHe disclosed that Nigeria may be able to raise USD$3 billion or more in a combination of tenors between 5-30 years.\n\nBuhari explained that the federal government\u2019s decision to raise the sum from the International Capital Market was due to the recent monetary policy stance that provides for very low interest rates and ease of moderating debt service cost.\n\nHe further disclosed that the proceeds of the USD6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act) would be used to fund specific Capital Projects in the Budget.\n\nThe president said such projects were captured in priority sectors of the economy, namely: Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, Provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral projects, Defence and Water Resources.\n\nThe letter reads : \u201cRequest For the Resolution of the National Assembly For: The Implementation of the New External Borrowing of N2.343 trillion (about USD6.183 Billion) In the 2022 Appropriation Act\u201d, reads in part:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this Letter is to request for a Resolution of the National Assembly (NASS) to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) provided as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the Budget Deficit of N5.602 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis request is in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act). Section 21(1) of the DMO states that \u201cno external loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its Resolution\u201d; while Section 27(1) states that the National Assembly may by a resolution approve, from time to time, standard terms and conditions for the negotiation and acceptance of external loans and issuance of guarantees.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as New Borrowings(Item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 Fiscal Deficit, of Which 50% or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) is specified as New External Borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may also wish to note that the allocation of #2.343 trillion to New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with the Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and to free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers\u201d\n\nThe President in another letter to the Senate, requested for concurrent approval of donor-funded projects under the 2018 \u2013 2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari further explained that the projects listed under the 2018 \u2013 2020 External Borrowing Plan, are to be financed through Sovereign loans from the World Bank , African Development Bank (AfDB) , French Development Agency ( AFD) , Islamic Development Bank , China EXIMBank etc , at a total sum of $36.837billion and 910, 000,000million Euro.\n\n\u2018Request ill-timed\u2019\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions to the president\u2019s decision were divergent, with some saying it\u2019s ill-timed while others said it was in order.\n\nFor Managing Director/CEO SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, the federal government\u2019s request for additional borrowing of $6.18 billion to finance the 2021 budget deficit is not healthy for the economy at the moment \u201ctaking into cognisance the difficulty we are experiencing in loan repayments due to reductions in revenue accruing to the Federation account.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with one of our correspondents, Gbolade noted that the \u201ccycle of borrowing will further sink the country in more debt with no clear cut strategy effective enough to service loan repayments.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s borrowing to fund infrastructural projects should have been designed in a way that the projects funded will repay the loans which is not the case, leaving us with dwindling revenues from oil and non-oil sectors to fund loan repayments with other government obligations.\n\n\u201cThe request by the president is ill timed as further borrowings will have a strain on our capacity to meet up with expectations of the people and will further add more economic hardship in the long run.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in order but\u2026\u2019\n\nIn his view, a public affairs commentator, Engr. Godwin Ubochi, the president\u2019s request is in order.\n\nAccording to him, the spending plan of the president at last year\u2019s budget presentation before the National Assembly was an indication that Nigeria would borrow to fund its budget.\n\nHe said: \u201cI maintain that there is nothing wrong in borrowing for capital projects that are self- liquidating. My worry is that Nigeria borrowed so much in the past without anything to show for it. Corruption in government, lack of transparency and accountability, inefficiency, incompetence and lack of capacity in governance and financial prudence are Nigeria\u2019s undoing in loan management. The management of this loan is not expected to be any different because nothing has changed in our government system. If anything, corruption level is much higher.\n\n\u201cWith a shortfall in government revenue in the midst of a pandemic, it will be difficult to carry on without loan, which should be the last resort after the government has done the needful from within. There is a lot of stealing and wastage in government. Until this is taken care of, further borrowing will lead to a deeper economic crisis.\u201d\n\nAlso a political economist and development researcher, Adefolarin A. Olamilekan, told Blueprint that Nigerians should not be too surprised as borrowing was becoming a characteristic of the present administration.\n\nHe added that continuous dependence on oil was making it difficult to get other sources of funding the country\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a surprise going by the character of the Nigerian state and the structure of its economy. First, it\u2019s a dependent, de-industrialized economy that is import-driven. Secondly, it runs and survives as a mono-cultural petro dollar and rentier state for revenue. Regrettably, since 1999 the annual budget of the country has always fallen into the prevailing circumstance of borrowing to cover up for the budget deficit, even when we earned so much from crude. Our economic managers still find reasons to borrow. Obtrusively, it\u2019s crystal clear that the 2021 budget is facing an implementation issue.\u201d\n\nTo escape the urge for more borrowing, Olamilekan, said government officials must come up with creative ways of tackling the country\u2019s economic challenges\n\n\u201cOne is obliged to as a matter of concern for objectivity and national interest, avoid the altar of selfishness. Moreover, a desired policy to address the country\u2019s budget deficit cum economic challenges is not farfetched if the government is serious, especially as present opportunities for creative solutions abound with us. Fundamentally, the Nigeria state must tackle loopholes and gap that have created corruption among revenue generation agencies abusing funds generated by under-declaration and false accounts. Also, the government should align its industrialisation policy on the foundation of sustainable economy revamp,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for a diplomatic boycott of next year\u2019s Winter Olympics in Beijing due to concerns over human rights abuses.\n\nWhile athletes would still participate, Ms Pelosi said heads of state should not attend. Ms Pelosi said the US could not proceed as if nothing was wrong with the Olympics being held in China.\n\nShe is the latest American politician to call for a boycott over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims.\n\nChina is believed to have detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, a large region in north-western China.\n\nMost of those detained in Xinjiang are sent to \u201cre-education\u201d facilities \u2013 prison-like camps where they are held for indeterminate periods of time without charge.\n\nMs Pelosi, a Democrat, told a bipartisan congressional hearing on the issue that heads of state around the world should boycott the Winter Olympics, which are to take place in February.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not honour the Chinese government by having heads of state go to China,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing \u2013 while you\u2019re sitting there in your seat \u2013 really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?\u201d she said.\n\nIn response, Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, was scathing of Ms Pelosi\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cI wonder what makes some US politicians think they actually have the so-called \u2018moral authority\u2019? On human rights issues, they are in no position, either historically or currently, to make wanton groundless criticism against China,\u201d Mr Liu told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.\n\nThe country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses.",

          "text": "Tyson Fury will reportedly fight Deontay Wilder on July 24 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas with his heavyweight bout against Anthony Joshua to be pushed back to December, according to promoter Bob Arum.\n\nThe Gypsy King was set to take on Anthony Joshua in their undisputed heavyweight title fight on August 14 in Saudi Arabia, but two days ago an arbitration case by Wilder ordered a trilogy between himself and Tyson Fury.\n\nA judge ruled that Fury must go through with his contracted trilogy fight with Deontay Wilder by September 2021.\n\nRecall Fury and Wilder signed a two-fight deal to meet again twice in 2020 after their first fight in 2018, which ended in a draw. The Brit defeated the American to take his WBC heavyweight title in February 2020 and Wilder then activated his clause to force a trilogy contest.\n\nAfter delays pushed the fight back several times \u2013 including an injury to Wilder and pandemic issues, Fury\u2019s team announced that they were moving on from the contest over claims the contract had expired.\n\nThe Americans reacted by activating the dispute resolution provision within the contract, taking the matter to legal arbitration.\n\nThe arbitrator presiding over the matter, judge Daniel Weinstein ruled in Wilder\u2019s favour, and insisted that the pair must meet again by September 15.\n\nIt was later claimed that Deontay Wilder turned down Tyson Fury\u2019s promoters\u2019 offer for step aside money as a July 24 date has been set for their trilogy.\n\nThe figures reported for the deal went as \u00a314million, but Wilder\u2019s coach Malik Scott has claimed that the American is insisting on a third fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cWilder declined and had no interest in step aside money. Y\u2019all are dealing with a different type of m********* here.\n\n\u201cHe want the blood, not that step aside money.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to ESPN, promoter Bob Arum said: \u201cWe\u2019re not paying Wilder to step aside. It\u2019s better to get rid of him and go about our business. We can make the Fury-Joshua fight for November or December.\u201d\n\nArum indicated that the bout will take place on July 24 at the new Las Vegas Raiders stadium, which can hold a capacity crowd of 62,000.\n\nThe news comes as a massive blow to British boxing fans, who were desperate to see Fury and Joshua do battle in all British heavyweight fights.",
