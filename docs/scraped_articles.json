          "text": "Lead counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, on Wednesday said the Federal Government must produce his client in court on Thursday.\n\nEjiofor made the call while accusing the representatives of the Federal Government of attempting to delay the trial.\n\nAddressing a world press conference on the latest developments regarding Kanu\u2019s upcoming trials, Ejiofor accused the office of the Director of Public Prosecution of deliberately refusing to present any of its representatives to honour the invitation for an agreement on a convenient date for the trial to commence, despite several reminders.\n\nThe counsel also called on the Federal Government to ensure that security operatives deployed to the court are civil.\n\nAccording to Ejiofor, security agents must not harass Kanu\u2019s supporters.\n\nKanu is billed to appear before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court on Thursday to continue his trial for treason.\n\nFollowing Kanu\u2019s rearrest in Kenya and repatriation, the Federal Government had amended the charges against the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.\n\nHowever, Ejiofor said: \u201cWe, the members of Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s legal team ably led by my humble self, wish to bring to the attention of the public of interesting developments in this case, since our Client was abducted in Kenya on the 19th Day of June 2021, and consequently extraordinarily rendered to Nigeria. His subsequent secret appearance in Court on the 29th day of June 2021, and his non-production in Court on the 26th day of July 2021, as well as what we expect in Court on the 21st day of October 2021.\n\n\u201cThis press briefing became compelling against the backdrop of the seven-count smokescreen Amended Charge filed against our Client last week Friday, after waiting for the over-advertised/hyped amendment for over three (3) months.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that upon the abduction of our Client in Kenya on the 19th Day of June 2021, and his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria afterwards, he was secretly brought to Court on the 29th day of June 2021, without our knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe, his lawyers were not notified of the proceedings of the 29th June 2021, hence, our unavoidable absence. The matter was consequently adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021, for commencement of the hearing.\n\n\u201cThis matter then came up on the 26th day of July 2021, for commencement of hearing in the case, but our Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was not produced in Court, neither was there any plausible convincing reason(s) for his absence in court on that day. An action which was in flagrant violation of Court Order made by His Lordship \u2013 Hon. Justice Nyako, for him to be brought to Court on that 26th Day of July 2021.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in view of the long adjournment of the case already on record, a decision which we believed may have been informed by the annual court\u2019s vacation which commenced during the said period, and in view of the Court\u2019s disposition to hear the matter during the vacation, we applied to the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for issuance of a Fiat, to enable His Lordship to proceed with the hearing on the case.\n\n\u201cThis application was considered on its merit, and the Honourable Chief Judge in his wisdom, consequently granted our application for Fiat.\n\n\u201cApproval of this request by the Honourable Chief Judge of the Federal High Court was communicated to all parties in the case, including the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation via the office of the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation.\n\n\u201cDespite being served with the approval for FIAT, and schedule for court\u2019s sitting on the case during the period under reference, the office of the Director of Public Prosecution deliberately failed, neglected and/or refused to present any of his representatives to honour the invitation for an agreement on a convenient date for the trial to commence on the authority of the Fiat, even after several reminders.\n\n\u201cThe hard fact we are compelled to swallow today is that despite the approval for Fiat duly given by the Honourable Chief Judge, and the readiness expressed by the court even in the open court, to proceed with the hearing once Fiat is granted, the Federal Government of Nigeria absconded from Court.\n\n\u201cAs the world is now aware, tomorrow, being the 21st day of October 2021 is the date on record, collectively agreed in open Court by all parties for the commencement of hearing in our Client\u2019s case, we, therefore, demand as follows;\n\n\u201cThat tomorrow, being the 21st day of October 2021 should be sacrosanct. Our Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu MUST and SHALL be produced in Court to face his trial. Thankfully, the Learned Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation, has though belatedly filed a 7-Count Amended Charge, along with an affidavit of completion of the investigation, so there is no excuse or place to hide whatsoever again to justify doing the contrary.\n\n\u201cThat Security Agents ostensibly to be deployed to man the court and its environs, or detailed to provide security on this 21st day of October 2021, should be manifestly civil in their conduct towards the civilian populace who are expected to throng the Court in their numbers in solidarity.\u201d",

          "text": "As Nigerians mark the first year anniversary of the End SARS protest on Wednesday, Osogbo, the Osun State capital, wore a peaceful look as residents went about their normal daily activities.\n\nA DAILY POST reporter who went round observed that business continued as usual in parts of the town where protesters could easily converge.\n\nBusiness and normal activities in places like Stadium roundabout, Oke-Fia roundabout, Lameco roundabout, Ogo-Oluwa and Olaiya roundabout continue undisrupted even as minimal police presence was observed at Lameco junction.\n\nSome residents who spoke with DAILY POST on the End SARS anniversary were of the opinion that nothing had really changed as the injustice that was the main reason for the protest still existed in the society.\n\nThey added that the Nigerian police had not changed its tactics and its mode of operation and the five-to-five agenda the protesters pushed for was yet to be realised.\n\nAyo Ologun, a journalist, noted that Nigerians should remember that End SARS was a metaphor for a myriad of problems that Nigerians, especially the youths, had been experiencing.\n\nHe explained that the protest took on the narrative of the youths deciding to reorganize, bring themselves together in order to change the status quo.\n\nOlogun admitted that several issues had led to the protest which came with a lot of lessons and regrets which included destruction, vandalisation.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have gathered one year after to review the issues and to critically look at other issues that led to the protests.\n\n\u201cThe five on five demands. How much of them have been met? What have been the effects of the panels that were set up across the states? How have people been compensated because many people lost properties and businesses during the protest and what has the government done to alleviate their sufferings?\n\n\u201cAlso, to draw lessons and to forge ahead as a nation.\u201d\n\nWaheed Saka, the Convener of Dialogue365, was of the opinion that there is the need for a sincere discussion around EndSARS from the point of view of the citizens, government, and civil society adding that a lot of lives were lost due to the protest.\n\nIn his words, \u201cSome businesses went under and government also lost due to the protest.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, what have been the lessons? The bottom line is, we need to look at the critical areas to improve our street engagements.\n\n\u201cFirst, to list the trust of the people again. Secondly, from the point of government, lessons have not been learnt and that can be observed in the show of force on the streets of Lagos and Osogbo today.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that it was not necessary, he explained that society being policed by all the power of the military is living on a keg of gunpowder.\n\nHe advised the government to show that it was doing something on the demands of the masses and also that victims should be adequately compensated.\n\nHe also called for a synergy between the people and security agencies especially the police in order to find a common ground to tackle police brutality, extortion in a way that will reflect the agenda of End SARS.\n\nLamina Kamiludeen Omotoyosi stated that there have been some changes but the targets have not been achieved in the country.\n\nHe also stated that there was the need for a discussion to find a lasting solution to the issues raised during the protest.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega, has alleged that moneybags\u2019 and godfathers have hijacked the dominant political parties in Nigeria and that the lack of internal democracy within the parties may cause them to implode. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are Nigeria\u2019s dominant parties.\n\nJega, who spoke on a television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, said it was impossible for APC and PDP to change and do the right thing as evident in the disorderly primaries they conducted recently.\n\nHe lamented that after 22 years of democracy, Nigeria is yet to rid itself from the overbearing influence of people who see political parties as special purpose vehicles for winning elections for their personal gains. He also said it was not yet time to require political parties to conduct direct primaries.\n\n\u201cPeople have captured and controlled political parties for self-serving objectives, so no energy is devoted to organising primaries. Governors deploy state resources to control political parties in their states to decide which candidate will emerge. It is all driven by self-serving objectives and it is political rascality.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, we have still not freed ourselves from this overbearing control of people who just use parties as special purpose vehicles for winning elections by hook or by crook. That is why many of us are beginning to think that these so called dominant parties are really a huge disappointment, a drag to the democratisation process of our counter, and if we are hoping for change within these political parties, I regret to say it will be very long in coming. This is why many of us are pushing for a new purpose vehicle for democratic elections and to ensure that we move in the right direction.\u201d\n\nJega said it would be hard work for the new party they are forming to upstage APC and PDP, but that it was not impossible given the commitment of the people involved.\n\n\u201cWe have to address the problems that are crippling us. It is impossible for APC and PDP to change and say they want to do the right thing and you can see the evidence in the so called primaries they conducted recently and how disorganised it was. Many of these parties may explode or implode because of some of the crises associated with their primaries. I am sure that many patriotic Nigerians are not happy to see these kinds of perpetual political wrangling take place in political parties and the arena of governance.\u201d\n\nJega described the conduct of primaries as a purely party affair and noted that INEC\u2019s responsibility was restricted to to that of a monitor. He criticised political parties for not paying attention to their primary objective of moblising citizens on the basis of a clearly defined programme or manifesto and getting people to register as members.\n\n\u201cThe parties have been dominated by so called godfathers and moneybags who are not interested in membership because they think that they can use money to field the candidates they want and to get the candidates they want elected. So the issue of having registered members is not their concern, so if they are required. My personal opinion is that it is not yet time to require political parties to conduct direct primaries,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on electronic voting, he said though Nigeria was not ready for it, it was however time INEC began looking around for the electronic voting technology adaptable to the country and how to harness it.\n\n\u201cWe are not as prepared with electronic voting as we are with electronic transmission of results. For electronic voting, since the prohibition has just been lifted, it is now time for INEC to begin to look around for what electronic voting technology is adaptable to Nigeria and begin to source it and pilot it before beginning to think of how to deploy it. Once we are ready, we may start doing it in phases by starting with large urban centres with higher literacy rates. It is what INEC can begin to look into.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the preparedness of INEC to carry out electronic transmission of results he said: \u201cI believe that it is possible in 2023 for INEC to do what I can call an \u2018A grade\u2019 electronic transmission of results. The objective would be to do it 100 percent but if we can get 70 or 80, it is still an \u2018A\u2019 and we should be happy with it and keep improving.\n\nOur fear of failure should not prevent us from trying something new that is being done all over the world because of how important it is to the conduct of free and fair election and the elimination of fraud. I am happy with the decision of the National Assembly and the harmonisation committee.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "\u2022Delta to pay over N102m compensation to victims\n\n\u2022Amnesty International urges Buhari to fulfil promise of police reform\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nWith lessons drawn from the string of violence that followed the youth-led nationwide protests against police brutality in October last year, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, brokered a reconciliation with youths in the state, promising not to give up his belief in them.\n\nYoungsters across the state used the opportunity of yesterday\u2019s Eid-Maulud national holiday to come together to participate in a peace conference aimed at creating a common platform for conflict resolution.\n\nIn Delta State, the government announced to pay a total of N102, 450, 000 to victims of police brutality after accepting the report of a judicial panel of inquiry into reported cases in the state.\n\nAmnesty International called on President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfil the promise he made to reform the Nigeria Police, one year after the #EndSARS incident.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who attended the peace forum, listened as the youths led conversation on how they could effectively channel their grievances to the authorities.\n\nThe event themed, \u201cRebuilding for Greatness: Peaceful Conflict Resolution,\u201d held at the LTV Blue Roof, in Ikeja. It was organised by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development and facilitated by the governor\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Youth Matters, Saheed Akanbi.\n\nA seven-man discussion panel moderated by Mazi Sam Uche Anyamele, a filmmaker, set the tone for the governor\u2019s response to various suggestions and ideas shared by youths at the event.\n\nWith a commitment to peace pledged by the youth, the governor, who declared that the moment for true reconciliation had begun, said Lagos could now undergo a total healing process after last year\u2019s coordinated attacks on its assets, which also resulted in loss of lives and livelihoods.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cToday is a day of reconciliation and it is about our teeming youths. This is the moment to create a common ground and take ownership of our future. We have, indeed, assessed what we have passed through as a people; it\u2019s now the moment to come together and build our lives together.\n\n\u201cThis event is about aggregating all the conversations of the millions of youths that have been represented here. All of us have agreed that, when we work together, we can build a resilient society we will truly be proud of. We will continue to build, engage and work with our young people.\n\n\u201cI certainly will not give up on you as partners in progress and your ability to bring about positive changes.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cI thank all the youths, who participate in this forum, for the valuable suggestions offered and the ideas shared. I\u2019m taking full responsibility and ownership of all the feedback recommended for me here. All the points have been taken and I will continue to rely on them in the course of governance.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Youth and Social Development, Hon. Segun Dawodu, said the state government recognised the youth as stakeholders in peace building and violence prevention. Dawodu stressed that the governor\u2019s physical presence at the event was an indication of his commitment to addressing the issues faced by the youth.\n\nRepresented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr. Oluwagbemiga Aina, the commissioner said the aftermath of negative conflicts would never be beneficial to any society.\n\nThe keynote speaker and Deputy Vice Chancellor of the Lagos State University (LASU), Professor Wahab Ellias, said the theme of the event connoted a resilient city. Ellias stated that conflict remained endemic and part of the society\u2019s makeup.\n\nMeanwhile, the announcement from Delta State came hours to the first anniversary of the #ENDSARS# protests that rocked the country in 2020, leading to the official dismantling of a unit of the Nigeria Police called Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nSecretary to Delta State Government (SSG), Chief Patrick Ukah, revealed this in a statement in Asaba. Ukah said the decision to mitigate the pains suffered by some of the victims was based on the consideration of the report by the judicial panel of inquiry.\n\nThe judicial panel, which was inaugurated by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in October 2020, received a total of 86 petitions for which it conducted public hearings in Asaba and Warri, with full legal representation for all parties.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cDelta State Government wishes to inform all Deltans and residents of the state that government has received and considered the Report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was constituted to receive and enquire into complaints of police brutality and related extra-judicial killings in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of mention that the panel was not able to make recommendations on the entire petitions received by it, as some of these petitions are currently pending in various courts in the state. Hence, making pronouncements on them would be subjudice. In addition, some of the petitions were struck out by the panel during the hearing sessions for various reasons.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the panel was able to establish acts of police brutality in some cases, resulting in death or denial of personal liberty and accordingly awarded monetary compensation for the victims in these cases.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the panel upheld judgements earlier delivered by High Courts in the state for various cases of police brutality, which judgements have not been complied with till date, including payment of judgement debts associated with them.\n\n\u201cThe state government, having considered the panel\u2019s recommendations in these two categories of cases, has accepted to pay the incidental claims recommended for the victims, amounting to the sum of N102,450,000.00 (One hundred and two million, four hundred and fifty thousand naira). This payment would be effected in due course.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, in a statement, called on Buhari to fulfil his promise of reforming the police. The organisation made the call in a statement titled, \u201cNigeria: No justice for victims of police brutality one year after #EndSARS protests.\u201d\n\nIt alleged that despite promises of reform, police impunity had continued in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement by Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Ms. Osai Ojigho, said, \u201cA year on, despite the gravity of these human rights violations, not a single member of the security forces has been prosecuted while judicial panels of inquiry set up to investigate abuses by officers have made little progress.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari must fulfil his promise of reforming the police to end the reign of impunity Nigerians have been protesting against for many years. Failure to bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for the torture and killings of #EndSARS protesters on 20 October 2020 is yet another indication that Nigerian authorities lack the political will to ensure accountability for these atrocities, and end police brutality.\u201d\n\nOjigho also stated, \u201cUnder the pretext of restoring order, horrific injuries were inflicted on hundreds of people and at least 56 people were killed, among them dozens of young people lost their lives as Nigerian security forces used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse peaceful protesters across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that despite overwhelming evidence, the government continues to deny the use of live ammunition on protesters at Lekki tollgate exactly a year ago.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International argued that investigative panels set up to look into police brutality had so far been marred by prolonged adjournments, intimidation of witnesses by police lawyers, and failure of police officers to appear as witnesses. It alleged that the panels failed to sit in some states, even as others went on indefinite breaks.\n\nIt called on the authorities to put words into action and decisively end police impunity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022El-Rufai to troops: Let\u2019s sustain momentum\n\n\u2022Says more bandits must be brought to bitter end\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian military, yesterday, pounded bandits in Kaduna forests with helicopter gunships, neutralising 50 and destroying many of their hideouts. The bombing runs were in response to a recent charge by President Muhammadu Buhari to the military to go after bandits and other criminal elements terrorising parts of the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai hailed the renewed onslaught against banditry and kidnapping in the state. El-Rufai appealed to the security forces to sustain the momentum and bring more bandits to their \u201cbitter end\u201d.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the airstrikes against bandit positions in a statement, said the criminals were neutralised during a combined ground and air assault in the Saulawa-Farin Ruwa axis of Birnin Gwari Local Government Area.\n\nBuhari had on Monday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in the country and declared that their days were numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 30 people in Goronyo market, Sokoto State, by bandits, sent a tough warning to the criminals, declaring, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari stated, in a release by one of his spokesmen, Garba Shehu, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before. The bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nCompetent security sources said the air assaults killed scores of bandits in Saukawa-Farin Ruwa Settlement. This was as Nigerian Army Headquarters said troops killed 24 insurgents in two attacks in the North-east and recovered weapons.\n\nThe bandits in Kaduna, who rode on motorcycles, planned to ambush ground troops at Dogon Dawa and Damari communities in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of the state. But were eliminated in the course of their planning, a military statement claimed.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn continuation of the Kaduna State Multi-Agency Op, the NAF Air Component on 18 Oct 21, provided close air support to ground forces advancing from Dogon Dawa-Damari-Saulawa axis.\n\n\u201cExtensive scan to avert any form of surprise attacks from bandits around the loc led to the interception of armed bandits on 5 x motorcycle 2nm east of Saulawa, staging for a possible ambush on advancing troops. With a good mind of judgment and sincerity of purpose, the helicopter gunship brought the miscreants to their unexpected doom with several precise strikes.\u201d\n\nThe update affirmed, \u201cAfter the neutrlisation of the bandits\u2019 ambush party, armed bandits on about 50 x motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa and were struck effectively with weapons on board. Fleeing bandits within the surrounding forests were followed up and engaged by ground forces.\n\n\u201cIn maintaining presence for an effective annihilation of the bandits, a second helicopter gunship came overhead the location in dogged support of the ground forces.\n\n\u201cSeveral armed bandits were seen scampering to safety in disarray under superior fire power from the ground and air forces, and were hit by the air asset overhead. This led to the effective annihilation of large number of armed bandits\u201d.\n\nCorroborating the military statement, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs said based on operational feedback to the state government by the Joint Operations Command, \u201cFollowing extensive scans, bandits were spotted on five motorcycles, about 4km east of Saulawa, waiting to ambush the ground forces. They were engaged vigorously by the helicopter gunship, and were wiped out.\n\n\u201cAfter this, armed bandits on about 50 motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa, and were struck effectively by the gunship. Fleeing remnants were mopped up by ground forces.\n\n\u201cA second helicopter gunship joined the operations, and many more fleeing bandits were neutralised by precise strikes. Assessment revealed that more than 50 bandits were neutralised during the joint operation.\u201d\n\nAruwan said El-Rufai expressed satisfaction with the operational feedback and congratulated the ground troops and gunship crews.

          "text": "\u2022Obaigbena salutes a man who chaired event that birthed ARISE Group\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, have extended the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the United States President, Joe Biden, and the people of America over the demise of a former US Secretary of State, General Colin Powell.\n\nThey expressed their feelings over the demise of Powell in separate statements yesterday.\n\nAlso paying tribute to the late former Secretary of State, the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, saluted Powell for his support and inspiration that ultimately helped to birth ARISE News Channel. According to him, \u201cPowell enabled the emergence of Arise News Channel, Africa\u2019s leading global broadcaster, through his support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, which he Chaired at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 2008. Arise Magazine, the global style and culture platform later transformed into the Arise News Channel in 2013 and is now available to over 200 million people around the world on multiple platforms.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said he believed that as the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the US Department of Defense as well as the first African-American Secretary of State, Powell was a great statesman and a global icon in every sense of it.\n\nHe recounted that as US Secretary of State, Powell played a very important role in advancing his country\u2019s foreign policy and national defence interests as well as being a great advocate of the eradication of Polio and addressing the deadly spread of HIV/AIDS disease in Africa.\n\nBuhari said his prayers and thoughts were with Powell\u2019s family and the people of the United States as they mourned the death of an exceptional leader and one of America\u2019s greatest prides, who as a professional soldier, a distinguished public servant and an effective diplomat, gave his utmost for his country.\n\nObasanjo, in his message, described the death of Powell as a loss not only to the America, but to the entire world, stressing that the late Powell was a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-arm, whose closeness as an African-American with the mother Africa assisted in the growth of the continent.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said, \u201cGeneral Powell\u2019s tenure in office marked a significant departure from the traditional relations between Africa and the United States.\n\n\u201cHe was Secretary of State under the administration of President George W. Bush, Jnr, part of the time I was President of Nigeria. He was not just an African-American, he was an African-American, who understood Africa. That is what I found in him, when he was Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWith him, among others, I have always seen advantage in the closeness of the African-Americans with the mother Africa. It is mutually good and beneficial for the Africans at home and for our brothers and sisters in diaspora in the US, Caribbean or Southern America.\n\n\u201cI cherished our relationship for the good of humanity in general and especially, for the good of our race, which collectively is the most abused, despised and disregarded race in modern history. He was indeed a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-Arm,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former president noted that the news of Powell\u2019s death was received with sadness, adding, \u201chis death is a great loss not only to his immediate family and to the United States of America but also to the entire world.\n\n\u201cThough the world, particularly Africa, would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities. May God grant his soul perfect peace and rest.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Jonathan in a tribute personally signed, described late Powell as a renowned United States public servant and great leader, who left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time.\n\nHe also stated that his stellar military career paved the way for other African Americans to reach for the top, because he articulated a new paradigm for engaging in military action.\n\nThe former President, in a statement by his Special Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, stated: \u201cUntil the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Colin Powel was the highest ranking African-American to have served in the public sector of the United States. In that capacity, he served as a beacon of hope and was a pride of the Black Race.\n\n\u201cHis stellar military career, which saw him become the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which pivoted him to also becoming the first US Secretary of State of colour, paved the way for other African-Americans to reach for the top. His articulation of the Powell Doctrine gave the United States, and the world at large, a new paradigm for engaging in military action with honour and decorum.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State, he was known for his tactful management of America\u2019s foreign relations, of which he extended a right hand of fellowship to the Yar\u2019Adua administration, when I was Vice President.\n\n\u201cHis death, at 84 after a long, useful and fulfilled life, is mourned by my family and I, as well as the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation. He left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time, and would be greatly missed. Our prayers are with his family at this trying time for them.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Minister of External Affairs, Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, said his admiration for the late Powell was usually for his astute military insights and less for his political performance.\n\nThe former Director General of the Nigeria Institute International Affairs (NIIA) explained that, \u201cFor instance, while evicting Sadam Hussain\u2019s military from Kuwait, he declared it would be a strategic mistake to overthrow Sadam himself. That view has been vindicated. That he got roped into the weapons of mass destruction deception is the stuff of politics, which perhaps explains his disdain of it.\n\n\u201cThe second reason for my admiration is what is now referred to as the Colin Powell doctrine about the need of \u2018overwhelming force\u2019 to guarantee military victory. In this respect, I recall a debate about the appropriate size of the Nigerian army in the aftermath of the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cLeading the side for downsizing were military Hawks like Gen TY Danjuma (and some of his colleagues in the Ruling Council) who saw a \u2018small compact and mobile Force\u2019 as being more economical for national defence arrangement,\u201d Akinyemi explained.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that then, in opposition was a group whose prominent advocate was himself, saying he preferred a large military for purposes of National defence.\n\nAkinyemi said he had argued then that there could be circumstances when only overwhelming force could win a war (a sort of Colin Powell doctrine).\n\n\u201cSuch circumstances as when a nation is besieged by guerilla warfare that overstretches the military. The military proponents decided to prune the military from about a quarter of a million men to about 100 thousand.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Powell\u2019s support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, two major ideas that changed the course of Africa\u2019s entertainment and social space would later transform into the Arise Television Group, Nigeria\u2019s foremost international television station, acclaimed to be shattering ceilings.\n\nPowell, during one of the festivals that usually featured musical concerts of both local and international acts, had performed a popular \u201cYahooze dance\u201d with the crooner, Olu Maintain, to the awe of the world.\n\nBoth Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, ultimately gave rise to the fast rising television station of global standard, Arise News Channel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says their days are numbered\n\n\u2022Troops kill 10 in Kaduna\n\n\u2022Tambuwal calls for coordinated operations in state\n\n\u2022Ortom worries about situation in schools\n\n\u2022US expresses readiness to help\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode in Abuja, George Okoh In Makurdi, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in parts of the country, saying their days are numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 40 people by bandits at Goronyo market, in Sokoto State, sent a tough warning to the criminals and declared, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari had earlier taken a critical look at the security situation in the country before news of the massacre in Sokoto State filtered in. He had boasted that the military and other security agencies were recording greater successes in the bid to rid the country of insecurity.\n\nThe president, however, counselled the Nigerian media on the need for accurate reportage of security and safety issues by replacing the usage of phrases, like \u201crising insecurity\u201d, with \u201cdeclining insecurity\u201d.\n\nBut in Kaduna State, security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area.\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, reacting to the killing in his state, called on the Nigeria Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to help stamp out banditry in the region.\n\nIn a similar vein, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concerns about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in schools across the country.\n\nUnited States reiterated its readiness to lend support to Nigeria in its bid to contain insecurity.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, declared, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cThe bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to Nigerians not to despair, because his administration was determined, more than ever before, to protect Nigerians from murderous criminal gangs with no respect for the sanctity of human of life. He extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of the Goronyo attack and called on the people to remain patient, as the military strategised on how to crush the bandits.\n\nIn yet another presidential message by Shehu, to felicitate with the Muslim Ummah, Nigerians of all faiths and the followers of Islam all over the world on the occasion of Maulud-Un-Nabiyy, Buhari gave a snapshot of the increased activities of the armed forces, the police, and intelligence agencies to effectively respond to the security challenges in the country. He said the increased cooperation from the citizenry, coupled with reinvigorated, dynamic, and energised police, security and military leadership was helping the administration score more victories against terror, criminality, and economic sabotage.\n\nHe argued that the reality of declining insecurity should replace the inaccurate narrative of rising insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform, who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the government expected and intended for those trends to continue, and called on the media to address the tone, content, and standards of reporting on security and safety measures.\n\nHe said the time had come for the media to revise the prefixes \u201crising insecurity\u201d with \u201cdeclining insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn his felicitation with the Muslim Ummah to mark the Eid-Ul-Maulud on Tuesday, which has been declared a public holiday throughout the federation, Buhari said, \u201cI am delighted to send greetings of peace, unity and goodwill to the Muslim Ummah, fellow citizens, and Muslims all over the world as they observe and celebrate Eid-ul- Maulud.\u201d\n\nHe urged Muslims to strive for \u201cforgiveness and closeness to the noble life and teachings of the Prophet (SAW), whose birthday is being marked on this blessed day. On this auspicious occasion, I wish you all the blessings of today.\u201d\n\nSecurity Forces Kill 10 Bandits in Kaduna\n\nSecurity forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, one person was killed while three others were abducted by bandits in Oil Village, a community located near Kaduna Refinery in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits were said to have invaded Oil Village on Saturday night, unleashing terror on the residents.\n\nSources in the community said one Mr. Auta was killed by the bandits while attempting to alert the community about the presence of the criminals.\n\nOne source said, \u201cMr. Auta noticed the presence of the bandits and he sneaked out of his house to alert the community since telephone services had been cut off.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as he was manoeuvring his way out to alert the community, the bandits sighted him and shot him dead. The bandits were many and were well armed, we couldn\u2019t alert security agencies, because telecom services had been cut off in our area.\u201d\n\nHe added that three other people, including a medical doctor and his son, where abducted. The doctor was said to have withdrawn his son from one of the schools for fear of kidnappers, only to be abducted at home.\n\nAnother resident of the area, who shared the information on a WhatsApp platform of \u201cCommunity News Update\u201d, said the bandits invaded the community about 11pm on Saturday, killing one of his neighbours while another neighbour and his son were abducted. Lamenting the situation, he solicited for prayers from members of the platform.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, disclosed that 10 bandits were killed by security forces in Kwanan Bataru, on the outskirts of Fatika in Giwa Local Government Area. In a statement on Monday, Aruwan said the bandits were neutralised in a gun duel with security forces, adding that several others escaped with gun shot injuries.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cOne Alhaji Abubakar Usman, who is likely to have been kidnapped in a neighbouring state and was being held by bandits in the area, was rescued by the troops, and is being debriefed at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits, who managed to escape, left behind several motorcycles, one revolver, mobile phones, torchlights and some charms. One of the sheds used by the bandits to hold hostages was burnt.\u201d\n\nBandits Attack Sokoto Sunday Market, Kill 40\n\nNo fewer than 40 people were killed as suspected bandits attacked a market in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The armed men attacked the market on Sunday, which happened to be the market day.\n\nSources in the village said the marauders attacked the market in large numbers and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of over 40 persons.\n\nA source, which spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the casualty figure was over 40, as the area was still unsafe for residents to access. The attack was the third in the area in two weeks.\n\nLast Thursday, suspected members of the outlawed volunteer vigilante group, also known as Yan Sakai, attacked and killed nine Fulanis at Manmade market in Gwadabawa Local Government Area of the state. Suspected bandits also killed 20 persons at Ungwan Lalle market, in Sabon Birni Local government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe Sokoto State government had earlier ordered the closure of markets in the Eastern Senatorial District of the state as a measure to fight the rising insecurity in the state.\n\nTambuwal Calls for Coordinated Operations in Sokoto\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal called on the Nigerian Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to stamp out banditry in the region. Tambuwal made the call on Monday, when the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Sokoto, the state capital.\n\nThe governor disclosed that the operations of the army in Zamfara State were having a negative effect on Sokoto State, especially, the Eastern part of the state, hence the need to carry out the operations simultaneously.\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and today, we have lost many people in Goronyo Local Government Area of the state,\u201d he said, adding that before now, the situation in the state was not as bad. He appealed to the Nigerian Army to review its operations in the state.\n\nThe governor also asked the Chief of Army staff to deploy more troops, resources, and intelligence to the state to end the banditry. He promised that his administration would do everything in its powers to support the security agencies to end insecurity in the state.\n\nEarlier, Yahaya commended Tambuwal for his support to security agencies in the state. The army chief, who was in Sokoto, his home state, on his first visit since his assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, said he was in the state as part of a familiarisation tour to divisions across the country. The purpose, he said, was to interact with troops and encourage them on their duties as well as hold security meetings with governors and relevant stakeholders.\n\nHe said the perpetrators of criminal activities across the country were also human, and said there was need to work with everyone to track down the criminals among the people.\n\nIn a related development, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, prayed for the continuous success of the security agencies against criminal elements in the country. While receiving Yahaya in his palace, the Sultan said he was always happy to receiving army personnel, having being one of them before ascending the throne. He disclosed that Sultan\u2019s Palace remained home to everyone, not only the army chief, but every Nigerian, irrespective of where they came from or their religious background.\n\nThe Sultan said his council would continue to pray for the army chief and his people, saying the task before them is more than the civil war era\n\nOrtom Worries over Insecurity in Nigerian Schools\n\nBenue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concern about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in the country. Ortom spoke on Monday at his country house, Gbajimba, in Guma Local Government Area, during the virtual handing over and commissioning of a Government Science Secondary School built by some oil companies in the country, including Chevron, Famfa, Prime, and Equinor.\n\nHe said education remained the bedrock of growth and development of any nation, wondering why schools should be the target of criminals.\n\nThe governor lauded the oil companies for investing heavily in the education sector as part of their social responsibility policy. He pledged, on behalf of his government, that everything in its powers would be done to protect the facility and announced immediate perimeter fencing of the school.\n\nThe governor also decried the high number of internally displaced persons in the area and urged the federal government to do everything to ensure that the people returned to their homes.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not keep quiet and allow some group of people chase my people away from their homes and continue to make them IDPs. Gbajimba has over 500,000 IDPs. I appeal to the federal government to stop these herdsmen and declare them a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThey should stop the killing and destruction of our property. I will not engage any militia group but seek justice of my people.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a mandatory responsibility of every government. I want to appreciate the recent effort made by government in nipping insecurity in the bud, especially, in the state but it should be sustained.\n\n\u201cI also appreciate the effort of security agencies, who are sacrificing their lives to ensure peace in our state. The federal government should do massive recruitment and adequate funding of security agencies so that they can put in their best in securing the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nUS Ready to Support Nigeria to Fight Insecurity\n\nThe United States government declared its readiness to lend support to Nigeria towards the fight against insecurity. The assurance was given during a meeting between a visiting US Deputy Security Adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, where security issues were discussed.\n\nThe US official said his country was willing to support Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting, Finer said, \u201cGoing forward, the security issues are very pretty whether it\u2019s terrorism or piracy, the US can support.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned democracy. The president is very much looking forward to convening the summit for democracy in December. The pillar of this summit is going to be issues relating to election, corruption.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not just a partner of the US but also a friend, which is much appreciated. The time that we spent and the conversations we had are very constructive and the partnership over all.\n\n\u201cI will not repeat all of the minister\u2019s briefing but it does speak the enormous agenda that the two countries share. We talked about the pandemic and the delivery of vaccines and the next phase of this which is actually making sure that those vaccines are administered and get into peoples arms, which is something we want to support.\u201d\n\nOn climate change, Finer said the US \u201cwelcomes Nigeria\u2019s commitment to increase its ambition, when it comes to climate change and we hope that it continues. There are no significant issues on our mutual agenda that can be addressed without working together. So, we are committed to continue doing that.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said the discussion was on a broad range of issues. He said, \u201cWe talked about the security situation of the country: banditry, Boko Haram, secessionist groups and other acts and challenges to insecurity, including that of Guinea and how we can cooperate with the US in addressing all the issues.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging the tremendous support from the US in the area of security, the recent delivery of A29 fighters and supporting other areas, we assessed the situation in the Sahel beyond Nigeria, right up to Libya, and how we can work closely together to address the terrorist challenges and the security situation in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn twitter ban, the minister said, \u201cWe talked about the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and how that is progressing,\u201d adding that the issue of COVID-19 also came up at the meeting.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe talked about the COVID-19 context and the US has been very generous. Just very recently, last week, they provided, again, vaccines to Nigeria, five million, and then another vaccine of 3.5 million that were delivered to the Nigerian government. We are grateful to the US government for this generosity.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Govt declares DPR, PEF, PPPRA defunct\n\n\u2022You have no reason to fret, FG assures agencies\u2019 staff\n\n\u2022My immediate concern is to meet OPEC quota, says Komolafe\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday formally inaugurated the leadership of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURP) as well as the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe development signaled the official winding up of three agencies which they succeeded as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe now defunct agencies according to the federal government are the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), whose Director, Mr Sarki Auwalu, was dropped by President Muhammadu Buhari after his name was initially sent to the National Assembly; the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA).\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, while speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of the chief executives of the NURP, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe and his counterpart at the NMDPRA, Mr. Farouk Ahmed, in Abuja, described the occasion as historic, saying it marked the beginning of a new era in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe explained that after a rigorous screening process and the issuance of letters of appointment to the new chief executives, both regulatory agencies have now taken off with competent leadership.\n\nWith the new law, Sylva stated that the federal government was expecting a lot of growth in the oil and gas industry, which he said had been stagnated for a long time while a lot of investors stood aloof.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIA has clarified the legal framework around the sector and the agencies and I don\u2019t see anything now stopping investors from coming and we are very lucky to have very competent industry people with proven experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe they can hit the ground running. Nigeria should brace up for exponential growth in the oil and gas industry,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nOn the fate of the preceding agencies, he explained that it remains a matter of law, noting that as the PIA states, all the assets and even the staff of the agencies would now be vested in the commission and on the authority.\n\n\u201cThat means that the DPR will not have anything. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It also repeals the DPR Act, the Petroleum Inspectorate Act and the Petroleum Equalisation Act and the PPPRA Act. The law specifically repeals them and it is clear that those agencies do not exist anymore.\n\n\u201cThe law also provides for the staff and for the jobs in those agencies to be protected. But I am sure that unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t cover the chief executive who was on a political appointment,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the process of assigning and aligning affected staff was ongoing and would be completed in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThat process will be ongoing because we have to rationalise the staff. The authority has staffing coming from the defunct PEF, PPPRA and the DPR and of course the commission staff will come from the DPR. That\u2019s going to be the process that will be ongoing for the next few weeks or so,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThe new chief executive of the upstream commission, Komolafe, in his comments, assured that the enactment of the PIA would usher in a massive turnaround in the activities of the upstream that he was appointed to midwife.\n\n\u201cNigerians should expect massive deliverables from the moment we take over in the sense that the PIA has ended a regime of uncertainty in terms of the governance of the industry.\n\n\u201cBasically, we shall focus on activities that enhance the production activities in the upstream in a manner that we will be able to hit our OPEC quota and will endeavour to ensure that we deliver to Nigerians a 21st century regulatory commission.\n\n\u201cWe will not just be a regulator, we will be an enabler of investment. So, Nigeria should expect be part of what we actually plan under our watch,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOn plans by the international oil companies (IOCs) to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, Komolafe stated that it remains purely an investment decision, but stressed that the commission would strive to engage the IOCs to understand their challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will engage critically with them and if it becomes their decision to move from their onshore activities, what will be paramount to us is to look at their challenges and see how far we can intervene positively. Don\u2019t forget the act makes the commission both technical and financial regulator.\n\n\u201cWe will do more because investment decisions are commercial decisions and we will see how we can intervene. But it\u2019s an investment decision borne out of certain considerations. We will try to know what those considerations are and intervene where we can.\n\n\u201cBut the key is that we focus on activities that will expand and enhance production activities in a manner that we can be meeting our OPEC quota and as much as possible to optimise the federation revenue,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the midstream and downstream boss, Farouk, promised to give a lot of attention to the development of the country\u2019s enormous gas resources.\n\n\u201cThe key area that you touched which is close to my heart is the gas development. This will lead to industrialisation, job creation and our main focus is to attract investment in gas. Of course, we need to work with the commission, the IOCs to invest in our hydrocarbons and more so in the gas sector because we have abundance of gas even more than the reserve of crude oil.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have shortage of gas, maybe because there\u2019s no investment? Why are we having challenges in investment, maybe because our pricing framework and other parameters that investors look at don\u2019t measure up? The PIB stagnated for over 20 years and the investors were sitting on the fence waiting to see what direction things were going. Now everything is clear, thanks to the government.\n\n\u201cWe will ride on that and create more opportunities for investment by going through the whole value chain for production to consumption in terms of fair pricing to all stakeholders,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum, Dr. Nasir Gwarzo, in his remarks urged all the staff of the defunct agencies not to fret over their future, stating that everyone would be fairly treated.\n\n\u201cThis is to assure our staff and CEOs that the transition process has been fine-tuned in such a way that shows smooth transition including the anxiety among members of staff across board. There\u2019s a strong leadership under the minister of state to make sure everybody is given a fair transition,\u201d he assured.\n\nOn his part, Auwalu remarked that the defunct DPR was willing to ensure a smooth takeover by the new agencies, stating that during week, meetings will be held to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\n#EndSARS: We will not forget 20.10.2020\n\nHow Homefort is assisting customers in avoiding running out of cooking gas\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s admission into Techstars\u2019 Accelerator Programme\n\nBackup\u2019s launch to commemorate 20.10.20\n\n#EndSARS: We will not forget 20.10.2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe #EndSARS protests first began online in Nigeria in 2017 as a cry to denounce police brutality and disband the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nBut, on October 4, 2020, the online protest gained momentum as videos of police brutality circulated on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protest, fueled by a desire for justice in the face of all forms of police brutality, resulted in illegal arrests, physical assaults, and deaths.\n\nTo cater to different needs that arose as protesters increased across the country, African payments startup, Flutterwave \u2014 after making a \u20a62m ($4,400) donation to assist injured people just after the protests began \u2014 started receiving contributions from the public via a link.\n\nHowever, following some threats from the federal government, Feminist Coalition (FemCo), a group of Nigerian feminists, who were at that time aiding the fight, sent out a Providus Bank account number and a Bitcoin address to continue donations.\n\nJack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, also backed the campaign and requested Bitcoin donations to support the movement. Interestingly, the #EndSARS campaign resulted in a surge in cryptocurrency adoption in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, on this day last year, October 20, 2020, several eyewitness accounts reported the shooting of unarmed and peaceful #EndSARS protesters at Lagos\u2019 Lekki Tollgate area. As people attempted to broadcast live, there were reports of network outages in the area. We discussed how this could have been bypassed in this article.\n\nMedia companies were fined for using the footage to cover the protest. Read.\n\nGoogle took down Arise News\u2019s YouTube live stream, and Facebook censored anything #EndSARS; both claimed it was a mistake. Read.\n\nThe Nigerian Army labelled many stories on social media fake news. Read.\n\nAlthough Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governor, acknowledged Lekki Toll Gate deaths, no one has taken responsibility for what happened. So, who ordered the shootings?\n\nWithout addressing what occurred, in December 2020, the Lagos State government and Eko Innovation Centre organised the Art of Technology (AOT 2.0) to reportedly provide an enabling environment for techpreneurs by ensuring proper broadband Internet penetration.\n\nIn sadness and despair, some saw an opportunity to help, an idea that could save others. Our reporter, Ogheneruemu, talked to one such person. Please, look out for this story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been exactly a year since the Lekki Toll Gate deaths, and after previous backlash, the public continues to question FemCo despite audits demonstrating how the money was disbursed.\n\nToday, we remember those whose lives were cut short, those who were jailed, and every hard-working young person being harassed by the police. And we will not forget how technology, through social media, enabled our voices to be heard.\n\nWe will not forget\u2026\n\nHomefort doesn\u2019t want you to run out of cooking gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the prices of cooking gas in Nigeria continue to rise, Homefort Energy, a clean energy startup, is helping its users purchase cooking gas at a lower price.\n\nThe startup says it replaces users\u2019 existing cylinders with brand new ones at no cost to the customer if the cylinder is less than eight years old.\n\nAlso, Homefort automates gas delivery to homes and businesses using Internet of things-enabled smart metres. It notifies its users whenever their gas is about to run out and schedules a delivery date.\n\nThe company helps users track gas quantity used, gas quantity remaining, consumption, and transaction history.\n\nRead this for context: Nigerian clean energy startup, Homefort Energy, wants to make sure you never have cooking gas worries again\n\nFrom the Intelligence Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian movie industry, mainly financed via public or private funding and international grants, produces the most films in Africa yearly.\n\nThe graph above shows the top ten African countries by estimated annual film productions.\n\nHealthtracka has joined Techstars Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson & Victor Amusan, Healthtracka Co-founders\n\nFor some startups, an accelerator programme might be as important as funding.\n\nAccording to the Business Developing Company (BDC), a bank for Canadian entrepreneurs, a business accelerator is a programme that provides developing companies with mentorship, investors, and other resources to help them become self-sufficient, stable businesses.\n\nWhy accelerator programmes?Apart from the benefits started above, mentors can also provide emotional support, which can be highly beneficial for some startup founders.\n\nSo, who joined an Accelerator programme? Healthtracka, a Nigeria-based healthtech startup decentralising laboratory testing in Africa using at-home tests and digital results, announced on Tuesday, October 19, 2021, that it has joined the Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme.\n\nThe five-month-old company sees its acceptance into the accelerator as validation, and there are some takeaways from the co-founder\u2019s interview with our Reporter, Joy.\n\nPlease, click here to read her interview: African healthtech startup, Healthtracka, gets into Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme\n\nIf you want to know what Healthtracka does, please, read: From death to life: how a loved one\u2019s demise spurred the idea for Healthtracka\n\nAnother one from the Intelligence department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), low-budget movies from Nigeria and other African countries account for most of the films produced annually in Africa.\n\nThe above graph shows the estimated number of films produced annually, private television channels, and cinema screens by African region.\n\nKindly follow Techpoint Intelligence on Twitter, @TechpointIntel, for exciting insights like this.\n\nThe CANS Foundation launches Backup to commemorate 20.10.2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s new?

          "title": "Nigerian clean energy startup, Homefort Energy, wants to make sure you never have cooking gas worries again",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Nigeria\u2019s gas consumption was 70,000 metric tonnes. However, in 2020, the Nigerian cooking gas market experienced rapid growth, with consumption increasing by 1400% in the last 13 years.\n\nBesides, in June 2021, per Vanguard, a local media platform, the Nigerian Federal Government announced plans to increase the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 5% to 90% in the next ten years.\n\nThis is because the number of users has quadrupled, and the retail network has grown significantly, according to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Opeyemi Owosho, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of clean energy startup, Homefort, says, \u201cthis expansion has resulted in a poor consumer experience in which consumers are unable to monitor the amount of gas remaining in their cylinders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, unexpected gas shortages are a common and recurring issue.\n\n\u201cLikewise, a large number of retailers are unlicensed, and their business practices endanger their immediate surroundings,\u201d Godwin Ogboye, Homefort\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), says.\n\n\u201cLPG marketers are hesitant to invest in new cylinders because they are unable to track the location of their cylinders, resulting in asset loss,\u201d Dapo Oyewumi, Chief Production Officer (CPO), adds.\n\nSo, these three men launched Homefort to address these issues.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom L-R: Godwin Ogboye (CTO), Opeyemi Owosho (CEO), Dapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nBefore co-founding Homefort, Owosho worked for five years in the gas industry at Fitcotech, which creates safety products to improve users\u2019 LPG handling safety.\n\nWhile there, he discovered some gaps in Nigeria\u2019s cooking gas retail market.\n\n\u201cI invited Dapo, whom I met at the General Electric Garage back in 2013, to collaborate on the idea. Dapo persuaded Godwin, an embedded system engineer, to join the team,\u201d Owosho declares.\n\nHe also has a degree in petroleum and gas engineering and has worked in gas safety operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOyewunmi was a former prototype manager at General Electric Garage. He is a hardware product engineer with a wide range of skills.\n\nOgboye was the former CTO of GRICD, a startup that developed a smart cold chain box that actively regulates temperature-sensitive items during transportation and storage. He is an embedded systems engineer who also works as a full-stack developer.\n\nSolving a real problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpeyemi Owosho (CEO); Source: Supplied\n\nHomefort automates gas delivery to homes and businesses using Internet of things-enabled smart metres.\n\n\u201cThese smart metres act as an interface with Homefort\u2019s user app. When a smart metre is connected to a cylinder, the app allows the user to monitor the gas level in real-time,\u201d Owosho explains.\n\nThe company offers digital tools to enterprise customers to help them track the movement and location of their cylinders across the retail value chain.\n\n\u201cOur smart metre\u2019s tamper-proof feature achieves over 95% customer retention by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nFor consumers, Homefort claims its smart metre transmits data about its consumers\u2019 gas usage to Homefort, which allows them to monitor the gas levels in their customers\u2019 cylinders remotely.\n\nHomefort\u2019s web app provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of gas levels in all of its customers\u2019 cylinders. As a result, when a customer runs out of gas, Homefort notifies them and schedules a delivery.\n\n\u201cWe notify and schedule a cylinder swap for customers who are running low on gas. As a result, our customers never run out of gas,\u201d Oyewumi says.\n\nMoreover, barcode tags on Homefort cylinders allow them to track the age and health of the cylinders in real-time. They also receive notifications when cylinders reach their expiration or maintenance dates.\n\nBesides, the company claims that its technology is exclusive to them. Its technology assists LPG marketing companies in increasing customer retention rates by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders, resulting in consumer retention rates of greater than 95%.\n\nIt also helps LPG marketing companies in tracking the location of their cylinders to reduce asset loss.\n\nSetting the pace in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGodwin Ogobye (CTO); Source: Supplied\n\nWhen it comes to LPG companies in Nigeria, Homefort believes that their competitors are still in the development phase, which gives them an early advantage.\n\n\u201cNupe Energy is Homefort\u2019s main competitor. However, as of now, they are not yet operational. Their product\u2019s hardware is complete, but they are still working on the software,\u201d Owosho clarifies.\n\n\u201cThere are competitors operating in East Africa, with two of them planning to expand into Nigeria, which I believe is a good thing because more competition leads to a faster consumer education curve,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nOverall, Homefort believes that its competitive advantage stems from the team\u2019s unique skill set and in-depth knowledge of the industry.\n\nA model that works\n\nHomefort generates revenue from annual subscription fees and gas sales.\n\nThe Homefort app allows users to access the company\u2019s services. To gain access to Homefort, users must first install the Homefort app, available for both Android and iOS systems.\n\nUsers pay a \u20a620,000 ($48.59) annual subscription fee, which covers the costs of smart metre access, gas delivery, and cylinder maintenance.\n\nAlso, Homefort replaces a new user\u2019s existing cylinder with a brand new cylinder at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years post-production.\n\n\u201cThe expiration time for LPG cylinders is between 8-10 years. While most new users who switch to Homefort already have existing cylinders, we replace their existing cylinders with brand new cylinders from Homefort at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years,\u201d Oyewumi submits.\n\nNew users who do not have cylinders or whose cylinders are more than eight years old must purchase Homefort cylinders.\n\n\u201cOur gas is typically 5% less expensive than that of roadside convenience stores. We make a 30% profit on every 12kg of gas we supply to our customers,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nUsers can use the app to track gas quantity used, gas quantity remaining, consumption, and transaction history. This feature is available and accessible to paid subscribers.\n\nSteady growth in a challenging economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nIn June 2021, Homefort raised a pre-seed round of $100,000 to help the company recruit its first hundred users. Idris Bello invested in the round.\n\nAlso, the company received $70,000 from All-on, the Nigeria Content and Monitoring Board, and Fate Foundation.\n\nEven though Homefort is barely 11 months old, the company has over 120 monthly active users. Also, in the last four months, its monthly user base has increased by 500%.\n\n\u201cWe have a long and growing waitlist of about 1,050 users. And our growth strategy is very enterprising; by December 2022, we plan to grow our user base to 5,000 per month,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nAccording to Oyewunmi, every member of the team, which has grown from 3 to 12, is wholly committed to the product\u2019s success.\n\nSome components of Homefort\u2019s smart metre are sourced from China and the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar has significantly impacted the company.\n\nHowever, it has begun reverse-engineering some of the components they import from China to reduce their reliance on dollars for component procurement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun reverse-engineering some of the components we import. By June 2022, we hope to have 70% of components sourced locally,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nIn the last two years, both funders and the media have increased their focus on energy tech startups that focus on clean and renewable energy.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem is rapidly expanding. There is, in my opinion, no better time to be a founder than right now. The ecosystem\u2019s support from experienced founders is incredible,\u201d concludes Owosho.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We discussed the inspiration behind the idea, starting and scaling in the ecosystem as a first-time female founder, foraying into the southwestern city of Ibadan, and much more.\n\nIn a follow-up conversation with the founder, \u00ccf\u1eb9ol\u00f9w\u00e0 Dare-Johnson, she discusses what a place in the Techstars Toronto means for Healthtracka, how she gauged the timing for applying to an accelerator and plans following the startup\u2019s time at the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it feel to get into Techstars Toronto?\n\nWe feel very validated. The problem we have set out to solve, poor access to laboratory tests, is one that we\u2019ve always known to be worth solving. Seeing a global accelerator like Techstars also identifying with us and backing us is exciting. It gives us a lot more motivation to make things work.\n\nHealthtracka is five months old; why apply to an accelerator?\n\nFor early-stage startups, and especially for a first-time founder like myself, there comes a time when you just want to ensure that you\u2019re building the right way. Why go through the mistakes those ahead of you made when you can learn from them? Accelerator programmes are opportunities to refine your ideas and processes through the right lenses.\n\nWould you recommend this move to other founders, and why?\n\nOh, yes, absolutely. I will recommend that every founder joins a global accelerator for the sake of themselves and their companies. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely excruciating journey, especially at the early stage, and being a part of a great accelerator programme is extremely valuable. Accelerators like Techstars are curated specifically to equip founders as they build and grow their early-stage startup companies.\n\nWhat was the attraction to Techstars?\n\nTheir reputation over the years. And as they say, Techstars is like the Havard of the ecosystem. They\u2019ve backed early-stage companies that have gone on to become Unicorns, so we recognised that they have \u00edntegrity. And of course, Techstars Toronto because I have spoken to Sunil, and I see how passionate he is about helping early-stage startups get to the next level. It is an opportunity to work with and learn from outstanding mentors and leverage their experience, skills, and network to create a platform where all Africans have access to at-home lab testing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after the Techstars programme?\n\nOne of our key goals involves doubling our customer base, and we expect that from a numbers perspective, we can increase the number of tests carried out and our customer acquisition. We also hope that we have increased access to global opportunities and stakeholders, given the reputation of Techstars, which we\u2019re looking to ride on to make bigger moves.\n\nCan we expect Healthtracka\u2019s expansion into the Canadian market?\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s nothing out of the picture; we can think globally. If we decide to expand into Canada, Techstars has the resources to ensure that we have all the support that we need. There\u2019s a part of Techstars that is called Mentor Madness; it\u2019s basically back-to-back meetings with great mentors. There\u2019s just a lot in store for us following our time in the accelerator, and this is opening our minds to possibilities.\n\nWhat are your Africa expansion plans?\n\nWe\u2019re currently present in two Nigerian cities, and we\u2019re looking to expand across Nigeria and then into other African countries. The good thing about our model is that it\u2019s asset-light, so we\u2019re agile and can move fast. Beyond that, one of the things that makes us so proud is our impact. We\u2019re adding more years to people\u2019s lives by bringing the lab closer to them. Also, the fact that we\u2019re providing more jobs as we expand is something we\u2019re proud of.\n\nDo you think that healthtech is an attractive industry for investors?\n\nWell, fintech is booming right now in Africa. But then, my principle is to always look at the future. It\u2019s easy to say healthtech isn\u2019t getting as much investment, but a few years ago, when eCommerce seemed to be getting all the funding, some people were insightful enough to say fintech was the next big thing. And now, the truth is healthtech is the next big thing, especially in Africa, where various challenges require innovative solutions. And as these solutions are built, investors will see a lot more of these opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthtracka joins Nigerian startups like TalentQL, Quidax, and Treepz (formerly Plentywaka) in the Techstars Toronto portfolio.\n\nAccording to Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Techstars Toronto, the nature of the problem that Healthtracka is looking to solve was a major attraction.\n\n\u201cAccessing healthcare in a timely manner is critical to protecting health. This is something that we immediately imagined as a serious problem in Africa with massive populations and crowded healthcare settings combined with gridlock traffic and low doctor-to-population ratios.\u201d\n\nRecognising the urgency of the problem, Sharma says that the issue of delayed access to healthcare services is not faced by Africans alone, so it was necessary to bring the team onboard.\n\n\u201cDespite being a more developed nation, Canadians also face long delays in laboratories and clinics, which can lead to testing delays or avoidance altogether. I could only imagine that if this is a problem here, it must be even more acute in Africa. When we met Ifeoluwa and Victor, we knew immediately that this was the team to back.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2006, Techstars is a seed accelerator that helps budding companies with human and financial resources, from mentors to funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "title": "#EndSARS: Despite video evidence, Nigerian govt insists no killing took place at Lekki tollgate on 10/20/20",
          "text": "Despite video evidence, Nigeria\u2019s federal government has insisted that no individual was killed on October 20, 2020 at the Lekki Tollgate, Lagos during the EndSARS protest.\n\nMinister of information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed who restated the government\u2019s position at a press conference on Wednesday, on the occasion of the one year anniversary of the massacre, described same as \u201cphantom massacre,\u201d noting that there is no evidence of killing by soldiers at the venue.\n\nRecall that a convoy of Nigerian soldiers had driven to the venue of the protest, and reportedly opened fire on protesters, allegedly killing at least fifteen of them, while several others sustained varying degrees of injuries.\n\nThough many of the victims, including parents of the dead, have been identified and interviewed, Nigeria\u2019s federal government has continued to deny that any killing took place.\n\nMohammed in his press briefing earlier on Wednesday, argued that \u201cOne year later, and despite ample opportunities for the families of those allegedly killed and those alleging a massacre to present evidence, there has been none: No bodies, no families, no convincing evidence, nothing. Where are the families of those who were reportedly killed at the toll gate? Did they show up at the Judicial Panel of Inquiry? If not, why?\u201d\n\nHis statement in full:\n\nTEXT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ADDRESSED BY THE HON. MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI LAI MOHAMMED, ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE PHANTOM MASSACRE AT THE LEKKI TOLL GATE\u2026IN ABUJA ON WEDNESDAY, 20 OCT. 2021\n\nGood morning gentlemen and welcome to this press conference.\n\nPHANTOM MASSACRE AT LEKKI TOLL GATE\n\nToday marks the first anniversary of the phantom massacre at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, which was the culmination of an otherwise peaceful protest that was later hijacked by hoodlums. At earlier press conferences, I had called the reported massacre at the toll gate the first massacre in the world without blood or bodies. One year later, and despite ample opportunities for the families of those allegedly killed and those alleging a massacre to present evidence, there has been none: No bodies, no families, no convincing evidence, nothing. Where are the families of those who were reportedly killed at the toll gate? Did they show up at the Judicial Panel of Inquiry? If not, why?\n\nSadly, the champions of a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate, including Amnesty International and CNN, have continued to shamelessly hold on to their unproven stand. Recall, gentlemen, that after bandying different figures, Amnesty International finally settled at about 12 people killed. On its part, CNN went from 38 people killed to two to just one, after a supposed global exclusive even when the network had no reporter on ground at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020.\n\nOn Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting. During the sitting, CNN was summoned but it never showed up, thus missing a great opportunity to prove its allegation of massacre at the toll gate. Also, Amnesty International had a golden opportunity to convince the world, but it rather opted for issuing meaningless press releases.\n\nIn its latest attempt to grasp at straws and redeem whatever is left of its battered credibility on this issue, CNN has continued with its baseless report that soldiers shot at protesters. In a report currently running on the network, CNN brazenly and unashamedly held on to its flawed narrative, relying on an unidentified mother whose son was reportedly shot dead at Lekki, but without convincing evidence of who shot him dead. The same CNN that tweeted on Oct. 23rd 2020 that 38 people were shot dead at Lekki is now struggling to convince the world that one boy was killed at Lekki. What a shame!\n\nThe testimony of ballistic experts before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in Lagos contradicts the tales by the moonlight by Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and their ilk. The experts, in their testimony, said inter alia:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters (emphasis mine) at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30-20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nThe ballistic experts are not alone in reaching that conclusion. In its 2020 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. State Department wrote:\n\n\u201cOn Oct. 20th (2020), members of the security forces enforced curfew by FIRING SHOTS INTO THE AIR (emphasis mine) to disperse protesters, who had gathered at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos to protest abusive practices by the Nigeria Police Force Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS)\n\n\u201cAccurate information on fatalities resulting from the shooting was not available at year\u2019s end. Amnesty International reported 10 persons died during the event, but the government disputed Amnesty\u2019s Report, and NO OTHER ORGANIZATION WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THE CLAIM (emphasis mine).\u201d\n\nWith the preponderance of evidence against any massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, we are once again reiterating what we said one year ago, that:\n\ni) The military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate. The only \u2018massacre\u2019 recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood.\n\nii) Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and others like them should apologize for misleading the world that there was a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate and for portraying the Nigerian military, police and other security agencies in bad light.\n\niii) CNN acted unprofessionally by relying on unverified, and possibly-doctored social media videos, as well as other open-source information, to conclude that a massacre took place at the toll gate.\n\niv) The Federal Government remains proud of the security agencies for acting professionally and showing utmost restraint all through the EndSARS protest and the ensuing violence, an action that saved lives and properties.\n\nv) The six soldiers and 37 policemen who died during the EndSARS protests are human beings with families, even though the Human Rights Organizations and CNN simply ignored their deaths, choosing instead to trumpet a phantom massacre.\n\nOTHER ISSUES RELATED TO ENDSARS\n\nThe National Economic Council (NEC), which comprises all State Governors and representatives of the Federal Government, and chaired by the Vice President, has already addressed other issues relating to the EndSARS protest.\n\nAt its meeting on 15 October 2021, the NEC received an update on the Reports of Judicial Panels of Inquiry into Allegations of Human Rights Violations against Members of Nigeria Police Force and other Security Agencies. Note that 28 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) \u2013 under the auspices of the National Human Rights Commission \u2013 had set up Judicial Panels/Commissions of Inquiry to investigate allegations of violations of human rights levied against members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies, especially members of the disbanded SARS.\n\nOut of the 28 States, 11 States (Abia, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Plateau, and Rivers) have submitted their final reports to Council. Governors of other States have also indicated that their reports would be submitted soon. Following deliberations on the recommendations of the panels, NEC agreed/resolved as follows:\n\nPAYMENT OF COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS\n\nEach State, in collaboration with the Federal Government, shall establish modalities for the settlement of all monetary compensations awarded by the Panels. Already, as resolved by NEC, a number of States have set up Victims Compensation Funds, from which several victims have already received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels.\n\nPROSECUTION OF INDICTED PERSONS (SECURITY PERSONNEL AND CIVILIANS)\n\nCouncil directed State Governors to immediately forward copies of final reports of the panels to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of all indicted persons. Where incidents in the reports relate to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC urged the Nigeria Police Force to take disciplinary action on the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\n\nIMPROVED EFFICIENCY OF NIGERIA POLICE FORCE AND OTHER SECURITY AGENCIES\u2019 ARCHITECTURE\n\nNEC called on the leadership of the security agencies to ensure that \u2013\n\na. Persons recruited into arms-bearing security agencies undergo psychiatric evaluations and drug tests before enlistment and periodically after enlistment to ensure that the personnel are psychologically fit to carry live weapons and to identify behavioural tendencies that may require psycho-social interventions.\n\nb. Personnel of the agencies dutifully observe Rules of Engagement in the discharge of their functions/duties around and within the civilian populace.\n\nc. While acknowledging the various initiatives introduced by the Federal Government to:\n\n*strengthen police accountability through the Police Service Commission,\n\n*sustain improved funding and budgetary allocation to the Nigeria Police Force and other securities agencies,\n\n*and the lifting of the ban on recruitment of police officers, Council urged the Federal Government to give priority to the general welfare of police officers and personnel of other security agencies. In particular, it advocated the review of pension and gratuity of retired police officers and attainment of parity of remuneration by police officers with sister security agencies.\n\nd. Undertake a comprehensive assessment of all police stations across the country with a view to ensuring that they are fit for purpose.\n\ne. Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies should deploy cutting-edge technology in the fight against crimes.\n\nf. Nigeria Police Force to, in line with the mandatory training provisions of the Police Act 2020, prioritize training of Police Officers on procedures for the entrenchment of Human Rights Provisions guaranteed by the Constitution and on the professional handling of weapons.\n\ng. All those detained by the Police as a result of the EndSars protests are expeditiously processed with due regard to the principles of fair hearing.\n\nh. The system established within the Nigeria Police Force for receipt and handling of complaints or petitions is strengthened, and all police officers on duty should be in police-approved uniform with their full names and force numbers boldly written for easy identification.\n\ni.The States should, as resolved by NEC:\n\nProperly utilize and support the community policing programme of the Federal Government, with active collaborative efforts and participation of traditional rulers, elders, youths, vigilante groups, etc.;\n\nEstablish standing committees under States Ministries of Justice to address human rights violations on a continuous basis; and\n\nTake measures aimed at flushing out miscreants squatting in uncompleted buildings, and other blackout spots that serve as hideouts for criminals.\n\nOf course, NEC also issued an advisory on public protests to mark the first anniversary of the EndSARS protest. While appreciating the role of lawful peaceful protests in the advancement of public discourse under democratic governance, the NEC strongly advised those planning public protests across the country to mark the EndSARS\u2019 anniversary to consider other lawful alternative means of engagement, especially because of the current security situation across the country and the possibility of such protests being hijacked by armed hoodlums and other opportunistic criminals to cause mayhem.\n\nFinally, NEC also pointed out the various actions already taken by Federal and State Governments to address the grievances that led to the 2020 protests, including:\n\nthe disbandment of SARS;\n\n*broad police reforms;\n\n*establishment of judicial panels of inquiries to investigate allegations of human rights violations by members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies;\n\n* recommendations of which panels are already at various stages of implementation including the setup of Victims Compensation Funds from which several victims have received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels;\n\n* and prosecution of police personnel indicted by the panels",

          "text": "As Nigerians mark the first anniversary of the killing of protesters at Lekki tollgate in Lagos on October 20, 2020, during the #EndSARS protest, a group, the Alliance of Business and Professional Women, ABPW, has launched a transformational initiative \u201caimed at supporting the youths to create the Nigeria we all desire.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Chairman of APBW Governance Board, Mrs Toyin F Sanni, \u201cthis movement\u2014 The Youth Connect Initiative\u2014 is birthed on the first anniversary of an epochal event in the history of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cOn this day, a year ago, after weeks of peaceful protest by our youths, patriotic Nigerians watched in horror as defenseless youths of Nigeria under the banner of the EndSARS movement were allegedly attacked by military men during a peaceful protest against police brutality, harassment and extortion in the country. The fallout of this event was calls for transparent and good governance.\n\n\u201cTo commemorate one year since the peaceful EndSARS protests, ABPW is launching its Youth Connect Initiative by which it will be equipping youths from underprivileged communities with skills to provide gainful employment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Nigerians have used the occasion of the anniversary to demand justice for the victims of the protest.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, former Senate President, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, said he is yet to come with the sobering events October 20, 2020, the day soldiers reportedly opened fire on protesters waving Nigerian flag at the Lekki Tollgate, killing scores of them; an incident the Nigerian government denies even in the face evidence.\n\nAccording to Saraki, \u201cOn the first anniversary of October 20th, 2020, like many Nigerians, I have struggled with coming to terms with the sobering events of that day.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their lives, loved ones, sustained injuries, or sustained other losses at the Lekki Toll Gate and at various locations in Lagos and around the country when security agencies were deployed to clamp down on the protests and non-state actors took advantage to cause chaos and mayhem.\n\n\u201cIt is worrying that despite the acceptance of the \u201c5 for 5 Demands,\u201d nothing has really been done to resolve the issues that caused the protests in the first place. None of the policemen accused of torturing and extrajudicially murdering Nigerian citizens have been brought to justice, there has been no marked improvement in the funding or quality of equipment available to the Nigerian Police Force and these incidents of torture continue in many security facilities nationwide.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, none of the perpetrators of the attacks on Nigerians exercising their rights to peaceful assembly have been arrested or prosecuted, despite many of them being identified. Similarly, none of the perpetrators of mindless acts of destruction and looting of property worth billions of Naira have been arrested or brought to justice.\n\n\u201cInstead, several young people are still held in detention facilities across the country without trial.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the lessons that ought to be learned from the events last year have been lost. This is why rather than mobilise to safeguard and protect citizens, the Nigerian Police have resorted to threats and mobilisation to prevent further expressions of dissatisfaction with the status quo. It is my sincere hope that common sense will prevail and the young people who seek to hold events to mark the first anniversary of the events at the Lekki Toll Gate will be allowed to peacefully gather and be protected from any forms of violence.\n\n\u201cThe carnage that followed the attacks on protesters by security agencies and non-state actors must stand as a lesson to governments at all levels that they must learn to engage with the Nigerian populace in a manner that preserves and respects their constitutional rights and freedoms or face the risk of creating an atmosphere that enables a breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cToday represents an opportunity for the government to begin the police and justice sector reforms our country so badly needs. It is an opportunity I appeal to the government to take.\n\n\u201cThis is the only way we can honour the memory of those who gave their lives for this cause.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Senator Shehu Sani, activist who represented Kaduna central senatorial zone in the 8th assembly, noted that the #EndSARS protest awakened the consciousness of the nation, while demanding that heroes of the event.\n\n\u201cEndSARS protest awakened the consciousness of this nation and recharged the reluctant and the slumbering segment of our society,\u201d @ShehuSani. \u201cIt was a momentous revolutionary event that exposed the limitations of the establishment power.A salute to DJ switch & others.\u201d\n\nTo mark the anniversary, youths have vowed to return to the streets on Wednesday, amid threats from police authorities, while many are taking to social media to demand justice for the victims.",

We have two classes of food \u2013 balanced food and junk food.\n\n\u201cA balanced food contains the necessary nutritional chains of life in their right proportion and quality. A junk food contains a certain limited percentage of what nourishes us, and the other percentage nourishes the doctor\u2019s pocket, because junk food causes malnutrition and ill-health.\u201d\n\nThe NACAMA boss also warned against denatured foods through over processing, or wrong methods of cooking, while advocating for the consumption of more fruits and vegetables in meals in order to get the daily needed vitamins, minerals and fibres.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) yesterday said a protest in commemoration of last year\u2019s #EndSARS demonstration is unnecessary.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who acknowledged that youths have reasons to demand for better life and future, admonished them to embrace dialogue and reconciliation instead of resorting to violent attacks.\n\nThe LCCC Director-General, Dr Chinyere Almona, who lamented the impact of the #EndSARS protest on business across the country, pointed out that the business community lost over N700 billion to the protests.\n\nSanwo-Olu spoke at a peace conference in Lagos with the theme: Rebuilding for Greatness: \u2018Peace Conflict Resolution\u2019.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nThe LCCI chief spoke against the backdrops of the one-year anniversary of the #ENDSARS protest.\n\nAlso lamenting the negative impact of the protest, the Ikeja Branch of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) said the burnt or missing case files in court have slowed down the administration of justice.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nThe Nigerian Association of Road Transport Organisation (NARTO) complained that it was yet to receive compensation for losses incurred during last year\u2019s protest, which was hijacked by hoodlums who unleashed mayhem on the metropolis.\n\nYesterday, the police warned against any violent protest in Lagos.\n\nLed by Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu, policemen staged a show-of-force in the metropolis to reiterate their earlier warning against street protest.\n\nAlso, police, soldiers and other security agents have taken over the Lekki Toll Gate, the centre of last year\u2019s protest.\n\nAt the Lagos Peace Conference, the state government and some youth leaders brokered reconciliation and pledge mutual commitment to conflict resolution.\n\nMany youths across Lagos State, despite the national holiday, turned up for the conference aimed at creating a common platform for the resolution to conflicts.\n\nThe youths discussed how they could effectively channel their grievances to the authorities.\n\nThe seven-man discussion panel moderated by Mazi Sam Uche Anyamele, a filmmaker, set the tone for the governor\u2019s response to various suggestions by youths at the event.\n\nSanwo-Olu, dressed in Boys Scouts\u2019 green shirt and light-brown pants, with yellow tie to match, said \u201cthe moment for true reconciliation has begun.\u201d\n\nHe said Lagos was now set for a total healing after last year\u2019s coordinated attacks on its assets, which also resulted in loss of lives and livelihoods.\n\nSanwo-Olu stressed: \u201cToday is a day of reconciliation and it is about our teeming youths. This is the moment to create a common ground and take ownership of our future.

teachings and virtues of the Holy Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W).\n\nChairman Northern Governors Forum (NGF) and Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong gave the charge in a message in a statement by his director of press, Dr Makut Macham.\n\nThe NGF said: \u201cThe special occasion brings to remembrance the teachings of the Holy Prophet who emphasized love, forgiveness, peaceful coexistence and humility among others.\n\n\u201cThe failure of humanity to practice love is what has given rise to selfishness, violence, intolerance, religious bigotry, ethnic hatred, corruption, high crime rate and unimaginable level of wickedness that is prevalent in various forms.\u201d\n\nHe added that the celebration should be used as a moment for reflection and reconsideration of the fortunes of the nation, which the governors believed \u201ccan be changed if all Muslims live their lives according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as contained in the Holy Qur\u2019an.\u201d\n\nLalong said \u201cNigeria in dire need of inter-religious harmony and dialogue, practical faith based conduct as well as truthful lifestyles that unite people and enhances their ability to experience and share love with one another irrespective of their faiths, education, economic status and ethnicity.\u201d\n\nWhile wishing the Muslim community a successful celebration, Governor Lalong assured that \u201cthe Northern Governors Forum will continue to work hard in promoting peace, tolerance, national unity and religious harmony particularly in the present circumstances where the nation is in need of a common front to overcome, corruption, insurgency, fight poverty and accelerate development.\u201d\n\nCleric urges job creation\n\nAlso, a renowned Islamic cleric, Sheikh Khalifah Aliyu Ahmad Abulfatahi, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle poverty and related suffering confronting the Nigerian masses.\n\nThe Islamic scholar also called on the federal government to create job opportunities for the teeming unemployed youths who have graduated and roaming the streets in search of jobs.\n\n\n\nSheikh Abdulfatahi made the plea while addressing a mammoth crowd of faithful from far and near that converged on the Madinatu Jummaat Central Mosque, Maiduguri, Borno state to celebrate the event.\n\nAt the event were Muslim faithful from Sudan, Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Morrocco, Mauritania, Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nAnd from within the country, attendees came from Lagos, Oyo, Kwara, Kogi, Niger, Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi, Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Gombe, Bauchi, Plateau, Yobe, Jigawa and Benue states among others.\n\nThe occasion was organised by Sheikh Ahmadu Aliyu Abulfatahi Foundation.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Sheikh Abdulfatahi said the event was to serve as remember of the prophet\u2019s struggles, efforts, teachings, sacrifices and propagation of Islam.\n\nHe said it was also to celebrate the successes recorded so far, especially \u201con how Islam is being widely accepted as a religion of peace and unity, expanded and developed the Muslim community worldwide in unity and diversity of all races, tribes, origins, riches, poverty and knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe gathering prayed for peace, unity and stability of the country, particularly, a quick return of permanent peace and harmony to Borno state and north-east region as well as the country as a whole.\n\n\n\nAbdulfattahi also urged \u201cNigerian leaders to continue to be honest, have the fear of God in their dealings and carry their subjects along by way of fulfilling their electioneering campaign promises and providing for the less privileged or needles in the society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAssisting the needy or providing succour to the poor or less privileged in the society is very rewarding and God is always with those who help others among them especially, the poor,\u201d the cleric said,\n\nHe also called on Muslims to emulate the virtues of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW), his successors and descendents.\n\n\n\nHe thanked Borno state Governor Babagana Umara Zulum and other Mulsim faithful that attended the event.\n\nMMWG\n\nAlso, the Muslim Media Watch Group of Nigeria (MMWG) tasked Nigeria leaders to do things right all times for the nation\u2019s prosperity.\n\nIn its message to mark the Eid el- Maulud, the group stated that \u201cthe exemplary character of the Holy Prophet made him an outstanding Leader during his own time and his integrity earned him large followership in the Communities where he never lived before that is \u2013 Madinah and in Makkah \u2013 where he was earlier driven out.\u201d\n\nThe group said \u201chis triumphant entry back to Makkah was a significant turning-point which all followers and leaders must underscore that \u2013 with good leadership and followership \u2013 a Nation could reach the greater heights in no distant time.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by its National Coordinator Abdullahi Ibrahim and made available to journalists Tuesday, the MMWG observed that \u201d few Nigerian Leaders have discipline and integrity.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, \u201cwas responsible for bad governance leading to unfulfilled promises to the electorates, corruption, lack of strong legal backing to stem insecurity, immorality and underdevelopment in areas of economy, health, education and provision of social infrastructures.\u201d\n\nThe statement called on Nigerians \u201cto be selective in the choice of their Representatives and Leaders to be voted for come 2023 Elections, otherwise their situation would not change if credible Leaders and Representatives are not chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Media Watch Group commended President Muhammad Buhari on his achievements in areas of infrastructural development so far \u2013 stating that the decay in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure was massive due to corruption of the past adding that that is why his giant strides in the area is being under-estimated.\n\n\u201cOn corruption, the Group called on President Buhari to step up his anti-corruption fight, especially on creation of special courts to deal with all the outstanding anti-corruption cases and other economic crimes. It also commended the President on his efforts in seeking global support on fighting insecurity and rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMMWG stated that celebration of Birthday of Prophet Muhammad would of be no value to Muslims who jettison his ideals of religious commitment, tolerance of the people of other faiths and building of egalitarian Society where welfare of the less-privileged is prioritised.\u201d\n\n\u2018Better tomorrow awaits Nigeria\u2019\n\nIn a similar message, Chairman Senate Committee on Local Content Teslim Folarin surged Nigerians to be hopeful of a better tomorrow for the country .\n\nSenator Folarin, who represents Oyo Central Senatorial District, stated this in his message to felicitate with Muslim faithful on this year\u2019s celebration of the birthday of Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW).\n\nHe stressed that for the better tomorrow, the time has come for Muslim Ummah in and across the country to pray for Nigeria to overcome the current economic crisis in the land.\n\nIn the message made available by his special adviser on media and publicity, Comrade YSO Olaniyi, the lawmaker said \u201cthe life and times of Holy Prophet Muhammed (SAW) were replete with lessons of sacrifice, service and humility. The virtues of service and exemplary leadership, as demonstrated by the Holy Prophet, should guide Nigerian leaders to give their all in the overall interest of Nigerians.\u201d.\n\nWhile wishing all Muslims a happy celebration, the lawmaker reiterated his pledge to continue providing qualitative representation and meaningful dividends of democracy to his constituents and the state at large.\n\nPDP urges rebirth\n\nIn a related message, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) urged Nigerians to use the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid-el Maulud for solemn introspection and make commitment towards a rebirth in all areas of national life.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan said this in a statement in Abuja Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cEid el-Maulud, the celebration of the birth of Holy Prophet Mohammed, presents a providential occasion for our nation to put behind, all issues that cause disunity, disaffection, strife and despondency and move to a new beginning by embracing the virtues of love for one another, tolerance, mutual understanding and forgiveness, in line with the teaching of the Holy Prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur party urges Nigerians to resist all forces that seek to disunite them for selfish reasons and continue to work together, especially in their determination to and chart a new course for our dear nation on the platform of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also calls on Nigerians to use the occasion to make fervent supplication to God for divine intervention as well as show love by reaching out to one another, especially the less privileged and victims of escalated acts of terrorism in our country.\n\n\u201cThe party also urges those behind the mindless killings and acts of terrorism in our country to have a rethink and retrace their steps, while charging those in authority to redouble their efforts in finding solutions to the challenges facing our nation at this critical time.\n\n\u201cThe PDP felicitates with Nigerians and wishes them a happy Eid-el Maulud celebration,\u201d the party said.\n\nAPC\n\nMeanwhile, a voluntary think-tank group of the All Progressives Congress, known as APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign (APC-LAC) has said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was backing efficiency and transparency in the management of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas resources with action.\n\nThe group added that the president would not slow down or relent on efforts to transform the NNPC.\n\nLeaders of the group; Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Lanre Issa-Onilu, Tolu Ogunlesi and Salihu Moh. Lukman, said this in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s promise to bring long overdue efficiency and transparency to the management of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas resources is being backed by action. And the journey has only just started. President Buhari will not slow down or relent in his NNPC reform efforts.\n\n\u201cOne of the many transformational legacies that will be associated with his administration will be the rebirth of the National Oil Company, and a repositioning that will set it on the path to becoming a world-class institution,\u201d they said.\n\nThe statement listed some of the achievements of the APC-led administration to include: \u201cPublished Audited Financial Statements for 2018, 2019 and 2020. This is the first published Audited Financial Statements since the NNPC came into existence 43 years ago.\n\n\u201cCommenced clearing the backlog of Cash Call arrears owed International Oil Companies (IOCs), inherited from previous administrations, and amounting to more than five billion dollars.\n\n\u201cCompleted the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS) Phase 2, doubling its capacity to 2.2 billion cubic feet of gas.\n\n\u201cCommenced construction of the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas pipeline, Nigeria\u2019s biggest-ever domestic gas pipeline project.\n\n\u201cCommenced the total revamp of the Port Harcourt refinery \u2013 yet another industry jinx being broken.\n\n\u201cResolved a 12-year-old dispute surrounding (Oil Mining License) OML 118, unlocking more than $10 billion of potential investment held up by the dispute,\u201d among others.\n\n\u201cThe crowning achievement has been the presidential assent to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), after two decades of unsuccessful attempts. With the emergence of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), a new chapter has definitely commenced in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cNew industry regulatory agencies have been established, to provide the necessary oversight befitting the new status quo, and the President has received National Assembly approval for his nominees to the management teams of these new agencies. It is truly a new dawn for oil and gas in Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\n",

If you look at it, it is a very heavy mandate. We have about 3.1million out of school children with disabilities that do not want to go to school. This requires our collective efforts to actualise this.\u201d\n\nThe NCPWD boss assured that, the curriculum when developed, would go through the appropriate authorities for proper implementation.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to share story, we are not here to share experience, but we are here to gather all the experiences we have over time, put them on paper so that we can develop curriculum and forward to the regulatory bodies,\u201d said Lalu.\n\nThe ES said about six Vice Chancellors of the Federal Universities have shown interest and passion for inclusion of PWDs in their institutions, adding that the developed curriculum will reflect in both the Nigerian colleges of education, polytechnics, and universities.\n\nHe disclosed the Commission\u2019s resolve to offer special scholarships for Persons with Disabilities in schools, adding that the scholarship will not start from Tertiary institutions but, right from the primary, secondary and to the Tertiary.\n\nWhile speaking on the effort made so far, Lalu said NCPWD is working with the Education Ministry to ensure that every federal school is open for free education for PWDs.\n\nThe Commission, according to him, has secured perfect partnership with the Nigerian Police Force to enforce the right to education of people with disabilities.\n\nHe said the commission will soon launch digital application that will help PWDs to widen their capacity.\n\nLalu, therefore, called on the relevant authorities to partner with the commission to actualise it\u2019s objectives.\n\nAlso, the National President, Association of the blind, Ishika Adamu said the curriculum will help close the gap in accessing Tertiary education for PWDs.",

We must never forget.\u201d\n\nBoth celebrities had, however, appealed to persons interested in the procession to stay guided and stay in their vehicles throughout the parade, as well as in groups for safety reasons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rolling up in cars tomorrow (Wednesday) to drive through the tollgate. We know their way, so a procession of cars is the safest option to minimize police harassment. We will stay in our vehicles throughout.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigerian Military Decimates Bandits in Kaduna with Helicopter Gunships",
          "text": "The Nigerian military, on Tuesday, pounded bandits in Kaduna forests with helicopter gunships, neutralising 50 and destroying many of their hideouts. The bombing runs were in response to a recent charge by President Muhammadu Buhari to the military to go after bandits and other criminal elements terrorising parts of the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai hailed the renewed onslaught against banditry and kidnapping in the state. El-Rufai appealed to the security forces to sustain the momentum and bring more bandits to their \u201cbitter end\u201d.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the airstrikes against bandit positions in a statement, said the criminals were neutralised during a combined ground and air assault in the Saulawa-Farin Ruwa axis of Birnin Gwari Local Government Area.\n\nBuhari had on Monday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in the country and declared that their days were numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 30 people in Goronyo market, Sokoto State, by bandits, sent a tough warning to the criminals, declaring, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari stated, in a release by one of his spokesmen, Garba Shehu, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before. The bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nCompetent security sources said the air assaults killed scores of bandits in Saukawa-Farin Ruwa Settlement. This was as Nigerian Army Headquarters said troops killed 24 insurgents in two attacks in the North-east and recovered weapons.\n\nThe bandits in Kaduna, who rode on motorcycles, planned to ambush ground troops at Dogon Dawa and Damari communities in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of the state. But were eliminated in the course of their planning, a military statement claimed.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn continuation of the Kaduna State Multi-Agency Op, the NAF Air Component on 18 Oct 21, provided close air support to ground forces advancing from Dogon Dawa-Damari-Saulawa axis.\n\n\u201cExtensive scan to avert any form of surprise attacks from bandits around the loc led to the interception of armed bandits on 5 x motorcycle 2nm east of Saulawa, staging for a possible ambush on advancing troops. With a good mind of judgment and sincerity of purpose, the helicopter gunship brought the miscreants to their unexpected doom with several precise strikes.\u201d\n\nThe update affirmed, \u201cAfter the neutrlisation of the bandits\u2019 ambush party, armed bandits on about 50 x motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa and were struck effectively with weapons on board. Fleeing bandits within the surrounding forests were followed up and engaged by ground forces.\n\n\u201cIn maintaining presence for an effective annihilation of the bandits, a second helicopter gunship came overhead the location in dogged support of the ground forces.\n\n\u201cSeveral armed bandits were seen scampering to safety in disarray under superior fire power from the ground and air forces, and were hit by the air asset overhead. This led to the effective annihilation of large number of armed bandits\u201d.\n\nCorroborating the military statement, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs said based on operational feedback to the state government by the Joint Operations Command, \u201cFollowing extensive scans, bandits were spotted on five motorcycles, about 4km east of Saulawa, waiting to ambush the ground forces. They were engaged vigorously by the helicopter gunship, and were wiped out.\n\n\u201cAfter this, armed bandits on about 50 motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa, and were struck effectively by the gunship. Fleeing remnants were mopped up by ground forces.\n\n\u201cA second helicopter gunship joined the operations, and many more fleeing bandits were neutralised by precise strikes. Assessment revealed that more than 50 bandits were neutralised during the joint operation.\u201d\n\nAruwan said El-Rufai expressed satisfaction with the operational feedback and congratulated the ground troops and gunship crews. The governor \u201curged them to sustain the momentum and bring even more bandits to their bitter end,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Army yesterday claimed troops killed 24 insurgents in two attacks in the North-east and recovered weapons. Commander of the anti-insurgency task force, Major General Christopher Musa, told Reuters that soldiers killed 16 Boko Haram insurgents a few kilometres from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.\n\nMusa said during the encounter with the insurgents, two gun trucks were seized and one was destroyed.\n\nArmy spokesman, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, confirmed that late on Monday, troops from a joint Nigerian and Cameroonian operation also killed four ISWAP members, who attacked a forward army base in Borno.\n\nAnother four suspected insurgents died when their truck mounted with anti-aircraft guns drove over an improvised explosive device, Nwachukwu said.\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\n",
