          "text": "The House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Public Accounts has asked the Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Services, Muhammad Nami, to immediately tender his resignation if he is not capable of discharging his responsibilities in the office.\n\nThe committee, which condemned Nami for failing to answer its invitation to an investigative hearing on Wednesday, summoned the FIRS boss to appear before it unfailingly on Thursday.\n\nThe lawmakers are probing ministries, departments and agencies of the Federal Government over alleged revenue leakages as reported by the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation.\n\nThe FIRS boss was billed to appear before the committee over non-payment of taxes to the government by three foreign firms, Indorama Petrochemical, Indorama fertilizer and Petrochemical Ltd, and OIS Indorama Port Limited, but he was absent and sent a representation.\n\nTwo of the firms are allegedly enjoying duty waivers and capital allowances, while the third was said to be operating at the Export Free Zone in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, thus causing a huge loss of revenues to the nation.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the Committee, Abdullahi Abdulkadir, decried the absence of the FIRS boss at such an important hearing.\n\nRepresentative of the FIRS boss, Mr Olusegun Olatunji, pleaded with the lawmakers on Nami\u2019s behalf, attributing his absence to the lateness of the letter of invitation from the committee.\n\nThe Committee insisted that Nami must appear in person, while the lawmakers unanimously resolved that he appears at 10am on Thursday, failing which he would be sanctioned in line with provisions of the Constitution.\n\nChairman of the committee, Oluwole Oke, said, \u201cThis parliament is the symbol of democracy; we are the representatives of the people. If President Muhammadu Buhari can cause an appearance before the parliament whenever the need be, why not his appointees? Enough is enough! If the FIRS boss cannot perform his constitutional responsibilities again, he should turn in his letter of resignation immediately.\n\n\u201cIs this how he wants to pay back Mr President who gave him the appointment? The nation is losing billions of naira from tax evasion on a daily basis, and the man in charge who is expected to come to the parliament so that a solution can be found on how to stop the ugly development has refused to honour the invitation.\n\n\u201cBased on the seriousness of this, the FIRS boss is to cause a physical appearance before this honourable committee by 10am on Thursday. We are determined to stop this nonsense. The nation is bleeding.\u201d",

And this was deliberately given the emotive nature of these two issues in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe NPC stated that religion and ethnicity, unarguably, are important indices like any other that are very relevant for purposes of understanding the population demographics of any country but due to the volatile nature of two items in Nigeria\u2019s national discourse, it would not be wise to do so now.\n\n\u201cThe commission has been very receptive to the sensibilities of Nigerians who have argued that the two issues should not be part of the questionnaires till such a time when the primary and fundamental purpose of census taking, namely, to gather data for planning for sustainable national development should be effectively etched in our lives,\u201d it said.\n\nThe NPC added that it would continue to be sensitive to the mood of the nation in designing instruments for census in order to make the otherwise data-gathering activity for planning less contentious.\n\nIt explained that before the main census, a series of stakeholders meetings will be organised where the items to be inserted in the data collection instruments will be exhaustively discussed and consensus reached.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be emphasised that this initial pre-test is to assess the effectiveness of the Enumeration Area maps created during the demarcation exercise, the census methodology, data collection methods, instruction manuals, data editing and coding, data processing and tabulation in preparation for the actual census,\u201d it said.",

          "text": "A map of Nigeria\n\nFlays Gov el-Rufai for increasing Kaduna varsity fees after sack of workers\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013PRESIDENT of the Nigeria Labour Congress,NLC,Ayuba Wabba, Wednesday,flayed the governor of Kaduna State,Nasir el-Rufai over increment by over 500 percent in the school fees of the state university.\n\nWabba said the action of the governor which came at a time he carried out mass sack of state workers was in bad fate, saying reasons adduced by the governor for the action were not tenable.\n\nThis was as he warned against giving\n\nchildren of the poor quality education, saying denying them good and quality eduction through exorbitant school fees was counter-productive as according to him, the children could take to crimes and other social vices threatening the security of the society.\n\nThe NLC President,who spoke at the 3rd National Quadrennial Conference of the Senior Staff Union in Colleges of Education,SSUCOEN, held in Abuja, particularly said insecurity will persist in Nigeria and Kaduna State in particular, owing to nonchalant attitude of those in governance to the welfare of the citizens.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that after after sacking these workers,he also increased the school fees of the state university by also 500 percent. The children of the poor affected mostly by this governor\u2019s decision went on protest and today,the school has been shut down.\n\n\u201cThe children of the poor who are being pushed out of schools due to high school fees thus denying the quality education may take to crimes thus threatening the security of the society.\n\n\u201d Unless we look at this,the insecurity threatening the country would persist,\u2019he said.\n\nHe accused the governor of sacking workers under the guise of competency, saying the governor\u2019s motive was beyond what he churned out to the public as reasons.\n\nAccording to him,since the attainment of independence in 1960, successive governments in Nigeria have churned out neo-liberal policies that tend to undermine the welfare of the workforce, which he said noted ,was the major vehicle for wealth creation.\n\nWabba carpeted the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El\u2019Rufai, describing him as one that would go down in history for degrading the dignity of Nigerian workers.\n\nNLC alleged that in one full swoop El\u2019Rufai laid off 21,000 teachers and replaced them with contract staff who till date have not been given letters of engagement.\n\nHe said with N50.7 billion Internally Generated Revenue of the state in 2020 alone, the governor cannot claim to lack funds to pay minimum wage of just N30, 000.\n\nAccording to the NLC President, insecurity is thriving in Nigeria because a lot of the dependants of those who have been laid off are taking to crime as a means to survive, a development that is alien to advanced nations of the world.\n\nHe said more often than not, politicians make promises to electorates they cannot keep, including engaging in manipulation of the workforce, exploiting their venerability because of their poor economic status.\n\n\u201cIts not surprising that today collective bargaining agreements are not respected, meanwhile there is nowhere in the world where such things obtain, for the working class in Nigeria, I am pained to say that it is not yet Uhuru.\n\n\u201cWorkers are at pains because their labour is no longer seen as priority and respected, therefore we must continue to say no to neo-liberal policies of government, devaluation of the naira has affected workers the most, all these contribute to security challenges we are currently grappling with, \u201che said.\n\nOn his part, SSUCOEN President, Danladi Ali Msheliza in his keynote address, urged the federal government to have a rethink on the kind of attention it pays to the foundation of teachers,especially when teachers will remain a catalyst for the growth and development of education in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, a situation where teaching profession continues to grapple with inconsistent policies around education, like the shoddy implementation of the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System IPPIS, non-implementation of collective bargaining agreements speaks poorly of a nation that is focus driven.\n\n\u201cOur students are children of the masses and the downtrodden, who are voiceless\u2026We must therefore, be the voice of our students and their parents.\n\n\u201cWe have seen lack of political will and respect for agreements duly entered into between unions and government both State & Federal levels e.g. the 2010 FGN/SSUCOEN agreement and many other agreements.\n\n\u201cAlso regrettable is the non implementation of 65 years retirement age for non-teaching staff in state owned Colleges of Education, including non release of White Paper on the 2014 Presidential Visitation Panel Report and the Presidential Needs Assessment Report (2012).\n\n\u201cAs well as the review of the Acts Establishing Federal Colleges of Education, and NCCE, including the stalled renegotiation of the 2010 FGN/SSUCOEN Agreement, inadequate infrastructure Classrooms, Laboratories, Libraries, Staff offIces, Students\u2019 Hostels among others, \u201cMsheliza lamented.",

          "title": "Nigeria loses $18bn annually to illicit financial outflows \u2014 CISLAC",
          "text": "Calls for establishment of Procurement Council\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Wednesday, disclosed that Nigeria loses $18 billion to illicit financially outflows.\n\nThis was made known by the Executive Director, CISLAC, Anwual Ibrahim Rafsanjani, in an address of welcome at a Conference on Illicit Financial Flows tagged \u2018Corruption in Arbitration\u2019 organised by CISLAC, which other Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, House of Representatives Committee on Anti-Corruption and Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, PACAC, Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, and Media.\n\nAccording to Rafsanjani the essence of the conference is to engage key stakeholders from the anticorruption institutions, civil society organizations and the media to share and exchange the knowledge and practices around Illicit Financial Flows.\n\nHe also added that the focus is on the gaps and potential corruption in global trade disputes through the instrument of investor-state arbitrations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe current situation of Nigeria regarding Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and Money Laundering (ML) is extremely challenging. Putting things into perspective, Nigeria loses about $15bn to $18bn annually to Illicit Financial outflows, largely generated by tax evasion but fueled also by grand corruption, organized crime activities and many other licit and illicit practices.\n\n\u201cAlthough Nigeria might be an extreme case, this model is replicated throughout Africa. Recent high UN panel calculated that for every 1 USD gained through foreign direct investment and oversees development aid, Africa loses 2 USD because of illicit financial outflows.\n\n\u201cOn today\u2019s topic, corruption and gaps in the investor-state arbitration proves to be another area where Nigeria loses precious resources while most Nigerians live in abject poverty. Many Nigerians have little or no knowledge on this topic while some disputes may influence our country\u2019s finances for years to come.\n\nSpeaking on CISLAC\u2019s concern about the ongoing case between Process & Industrial Developments Limited and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, warned that may lead to the gigantic loss of funds, which also forms the crux of the conference.\n\n\u201cA single case of the Process & Industrial Developments Limited contra the Federal Republic of Nigeria may lead to the gigantic loss of funds, and we feel that there is need for key stakeholders from the anticorruption institutions, civil society organizations and the media to debate the factors that have almost led to this national catastrophe\u201d, he said.\n\nRecalling the legal battle between the Federal Government and P&ID, he (Rafsanjani) stated that, \u201cThe Process & Industrial Developments Limited v Federal Republic of Nigeria arbitration case concerns a 2010 contract relating to the construction and operation of a gas processing facility between Process and Industrial Developments Ltd (P&ID), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cLess than three years after the contract was signed, P&ID initiated arbitration, alleging that Nigeria had not performed its obligations under the contract and seeking damages for lost profits. Despite a number of corruption-related red flags in the contract, Nigeria did not raise the issue of corruption in its defence in the arbitration.\n\n\u201cThe tribunal concluded that Nigeria had repudiated the contract. It awarded P&ID US$6.6 billion in damages plus 7 per cent interest per annum, even though neither party had taken significant steps to perform their obligations under the contract.\n\n\u201cNigeria did not immediately pay the award. This damage in favor of the Process & Industrial Developments Limited, a sum which if includes the 7% interest per annum will be at about $10bn a figure equal to 28% of the country\u2019s current 2021 annual budget.\n\n\u201cSo far as we are aware, the arbitration in P&ID v Nigeria was conducted entirely in secret, and the existence of the arbitration did not become public knowledge until 2015, following a change of government in Nigeria. At that point in time the jurisdictional and merits phase of the arbitration had already been concluded.\n\n\u201cIn response, in 2018, P&ID commenced proceedings in English courts to enforce the award. In August 2019, the English High Court granted P&ID leave to enforce the award. Nigeria has belatedly raised allegations of corruption in its attempt to avoid enforcement of the award in English courts.\n\n\u201cIt alleges a long-running corrupt conspiracy in which associates of P&ID paid bribes to the Ministry of Petroleum Resources officials to obtain the contract and to ensure that the Ministry did not vigorously contest the subsequent arbitration.\n\n\u201cDue to the fact that this case is in court, we take no position on the case. Our message is for us all to learn from it and prevent further occurrences.\u201d\n\nHowever, he stated that CISLAC being a key stakeholder in the advocacy for transparency and accountability in Nigeria demands establishment of Procurement Council as stipulated in the Procurement Act 2007.\n\n\u201cWe would like to recommend that full adherence to the procurement act will help prevent the occurrence of the contract which led to this arbitration award in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe would like to also call on the Federal government to inaugurate the procurement council as stipulated in the Procurement Act 2007. The existence of a publicly accessible beneficial ownership register will also go a long way in preventing corruption in public procurement\u201d, he added.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the Chairman of Economic Crimes Commission , EFCC, Bawa Abdulrasheed, represented by Head Research, EFCC, Abiodun Adebanjo, disclosed that the Act establishing the Commission clearly states what illicit financial outflow means, \u2018Economic and financial crimes according to the Section 46 (Par. 2) of the EFCC Establishment Act (2004) is captured as:\u2026all the non-violent criminal and illicit activity committed with the objectives of earning wealth illegally either individually or in a group or organized manner thereby violating existing legislation governing the economic activities of government and its administration and includes any form of fraud, narcotic drug trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement, bribery, looting and any form of corrupt malpractices, illegal arms deal, smuggling, human trafficking and child labour, illegal oil bunkering and illegal mining, tax evasion, foreign exchange malpractices including counterfeiting of currency, theft of intellectual property and piracy, open market abuse, dumping of toxic wastes and prohibited goods, etc.\u2019\n\n\u201cThese are indeed the sources of IFFs in Nigeria. IFFs remain one of the most pervasive and daunting challenges Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cInvestigations by the EFCC and other international law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Crime Agency (NCA). Whom we work very closely with at the EFCC reveals that the massive flow of illicit money out of Nigeria is facilitated by Global Shadow Financial System (GSFS) comprising Tax havens, secrecy jurisdiction, disguised corporations, anonymous trust accounts, fake foundations, trade mispricing, multinational asset stripping and money laundering techniques.\u201d\n\nHe also made it known that the IFFs in Nigeria is perpetrated by corrupt leaders and their foreign accomplices and multinational companies.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have seen in Nigeria is that corrupt government officials and their private sector collaborators use fronts and ownership structures that do not provide sufficient information about the true identities of the natural persons behind the title to hide illicit money and transfer same to safe heaven foreign jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is not just about anonymity but the lack of transparency on the part of the countries where these monies are held to the countries where these monies are stolen from\u201d, he stated.\n\nAccording to the EFCC boss he presented the Nigeria Statement at the United Special Session of the General Assembly (UNGASS) on \u201cChallenges and Measures to Prevent and Combat Corruption and Strengthen International Cooperation,\u201d at United Nations Headquarters, New York.\n\n\u201cIn the address the position of Nigeria on the need to stop IFFs was clearly outlined.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria called for a multifaceted approach at UNGASS, in addressing illicit financial flows, as recommended by the High Level Panel Report on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for achieving the 2030 Agenda (FACTI Panel), we are 100% committed to this at the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe FACTI Panel Report provides paths to financial integrity for sustainable development, strongly showing how to redirect the resources lost from illicit flows to finance the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs.\n\nHe also disclosed that, \u201cAside the Abacha related resources, the EFCC is working on repatriating several others funds. Just recently as we may recall the UK Government returned to Nigeria \u00a34.2 Million Pounds that was taken out of Nigeria by the former Governor of Delta State, Mr. James Ibori.\u201d\n\nAnd he also assured that, \u201cWe at the EFCC are fully committed to supporting efforts at curtailing IFFs in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he promised support for CISLAC in its effort and all other NGOs and INGOs in this regards in the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cWe believe at the EFCC that the quest for \u201cIFFs free Nigeria\u201d is a task that must be done and all and sundry are important in this fight. Once again I want to thank CISLAC for organizing this conference\u201d, he said.\n\nChairman House Committee on Anti-Corruption, Hon. Shehu Nicholas Garba, represented by member of the committee, Hon Yohanna Micah Jiba, said illicit financial flows emerge from countries of origin and these are monies that supposed to service public services including health, education, security, and infrastructural development.\n\nGarba also promised the Committee\u2019s collaboration with CISLAC in the fight against corruption.\n\nAlso giving a goodwill message, the Executive Secretary, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, PACAC, Prof Sadiq Radda, said, \u201cAs far as this government is concerned there is no going back in the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cThe President and the Vice President have made commitment to Nigerians that corruption will be fought as long as we are concerned there is no going back. For the first time in this country that the President and Vice President has said is not going to be business as usual this is because we all believe as a country we will not make the needed progress unless and until we fight corruption.\n\n\u201cFighting corruption is not a choice but a necessity and it is a necessity because for us that are living now in Nigeria the resources of the country must be for the citizens, and again for our children to be proud of a country that belongs to them there is work to do.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to partner with CISLAC and other CSOs to fight corruption believing that there is no single individual or any arm of government that can successfully fight corruption.\n\n\u201cCorruption has to be fought jointly, collaboratively and everybody giving assistance. That is why the President has always said it is not a personal thing; the President and the Vice President alone cannot fight corruption. The legislature, CSOs, civil servants, religious people and all citizens have to play a role.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Ekaete Bassey\n\nFounder of Household of God Church Rev. Chris Okotie has come under fire over his seemingly farewell epistle to the late TB Joshua.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the clergyman shared a cryptic post on his Facebook page in which he referenced a certain \u201cWizard of Endor\u201d who assumed the title \u201cEmmanuel\u201d.\n\nThe clergyman said the wizard who assumed the title of Emmanuel had been consumed by divine indignation.\n\nHis post comes days after T.B Joshua, who was known for using the name \u201cEmmanuel\u201d in his church, died.\n\nOkotie further noted that the day of God\u2019s vengeance has fully come to Nigeria though it wasn\u2019t clear who he was directly referencing in his post.\n\n\u201cHebrews 1:13 says, \u201cSit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wizard at Endor who assumed the title Emmanuel has been consumed by divine indignation. And now his disciples bewail his ignominious exit.\n\n\u201cNo marvel, one-third of God\u2019s angels followed the disgraced anointed cherub Lucifer!!\n\n\u201cJesus our mighty gladiator has broken the head of the dragon with his mighty blows.\n\n\u201cHe has descended from the mountain of spices with the fiery sword of his indignation. Glorious in his apparel and traveling in the greatness of his strength, he goes conquering and to conquer the adversaries of his church.\n\n\u201cLet those who swear by the Lord and by Malcham and the descendants of Haman, now tremble in fear.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe day of the vengeance of our God has fully come to Nigeria. And they shall not escape,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSocial media users have come for the entirety of the clergyman as they slammed him hard while describing his post as insensitive.\n\nDaniel Okon stated: \u201cHmmmmmmmmmm, who made you a judge ? Thank God TB Joshua lived a life of humanity but what example are you showing to your followers than speaking English and changing wives !\n\nI don\u2019t criticize men of God but I don\u2019t also like when the supposed men of God talk down on others bcos no one is holy.\n\nOnly God almighty can judge TB Joshua not Okotie.\u201d\n\nPrince Timmy Oye wtote: \u201cIf truly he is referring to Pastor TB Joshua, he needs a mental health evaluation. Because a normal human being will never come out and be happy that a fellow human being died.\u201d\n\nNolly Ogunka Nwadike said: \u201cChris Okotie the minister of several women, is TB Joshua the reason for his failed career? Na him say make u get F9 for music, F9 for politics, F9 for marriage, F9 for even God\u2019s work!!!! Shame shame shame shameeeeeee!!!! Tueeeeeeeeh!!\u201d\n\nNnenna Anthony stated: \u201cHe is entitled to his views and opinion\u2026.but who are we to judge,this God can fight his battle.\u201d\n\nNikky Nikeja Momoh wrote: \u201cVery insensitive post. TB Joshua is a man of God. Because Satan can never teach you to give like he does, It takes the Holy Spirit to move such a person. He gave from coast to coast, country to country, north to south.\n\nThat\u2019s enough for God to be even moved for mercy and companion on him. From the last I checked, he was married to his wife from beginning to end. Sir, what position is the woman in your house now? Let everyone go and examine himself. Our own rapture will come soon just like TB Joshua\u2019s has taken place. RIP God\u2019s general.\u201d\n\nOluwafemi Falayi stated: \u201cI hope you live forever, your own is to speak big grammar and lie that God has sent you to become Nigeria President, how many Nigerians are you helping like Pastor TB Joshua? We shall all die because death is a debt that we must all pay someday, it is satanic to speak badly of the dead.\u201d\n\nSunny best Ezekiel said: \u201cThis attention seeker is also a fake prophet was he not the one that said God told him to become the president of this great nation Nigeria and he failed?\u201d",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United States Government has called for the immediate reversal of the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe call by the US is the fourth intervention the country has made in a week after last Friday\u2019s suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said the suspension was nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech.\n\nPower noted that Nigeria has nearly 40 million Twitter users, while also saying that the country was home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub.\n\nIn a Facebook post by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, Power said the suspension should be reversed immediately.\n\n\u2018There are nearly 40 M Twitter users in #Nigeria, and the country is home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub. This suspension is nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech and should be reversed immediately,\u2019 Power said.\n\nThe United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria had last Saturday issued a statement where it said the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\n\u2018Nigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. Banning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity,\u2019 the United States said.\n\nClosely followed by the statement was a joint release by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian High Commission and the Embassy of Ireland.\n\nIn the joint statement, the five missions expressed disappointment over the Federal Government\u2019s decision to place a ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America convey our disappointment over the Government of Nigeria\u2019s announcement suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media,\u2019 the statement partly read.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, had while responding to a question concerning the joint statement on Monday during a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said the missions maintained their position.\n\n\u2018We remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important, and perhaps even more important in troubled times,\u2019 Leonard said.",

But nothing is too difficult for God to do. That is why we are here,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle. We have to cry out to God to help us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Onaiyekan has urged Nigerians to put elected leaders on their toes and hold them accountable.\n\nHe stated this at the North Central Zonal Dialogue Conference, organised by Lux Terra Leadership Foundation, in partnership with Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development.\n\n\u201cNigerians have gotten used to just sitting and complaining about everything. They complain about government and politicians but they do not take their role of citizen participation seriously. The leaders are happy about this and take full advantage of the docile nature of most Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, it is only when Nigerians actively use their right of citizen participation in governance that the leaders will be on their toes and live up to their responsibilities.\n\nThe cleric reminded leaders that once they took their oath of office with either Bible or Quran, they had put themselves under the judgment of God.\n\nAnother panelist, Mr Bola Abimbola, Executive Director of Savannah Centre, noted that some of the problems in the country stemmed from a trust-deficit between government and citizens.\n\nAbimbola, represented by Mr Felix Pwol, a Director at the centre, said it was imperative for government to focus on achieving national unity, national security, women and youth development as well as civil society and government partnership.\n\nExecutive Director of Lux Terra, Rev. Fr. George Ehusani, said that the conference was a response to the ongoing widespread call for dialogue towards resolving Nigeria\u2019s worsening socio-economic, political and security challenges.\n\nPanelists at the conference included: Prof. Olugbemiro Jegede, pioneer Vice-Chancellor, National Open University and Mr Audu Ogbeh, a former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nOthers were: Mr Labaran Maku, a former Minister of Information, Eugenia Abu, a retired staffer of Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) and Mrs Ene Edeh, a rights activist.\n\nParticipants were drawn from the six states of the North-Central geo-political zone: Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nassarawa, Niger and Plateau.",

          "text": "On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, defied the Nigerian government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nThe government had last Friday banned Twitter after the App deleted a controversial comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari, in which he made reference to the Nigerian Civil War, which many Nigerians described as distasteful.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nAmidst the public outcry and criticism that followed the government\u2019s decision, Malami on Saturday directed the Director of Public Prosecutions in his office to begin the process of prosecuting violators of the government suspension order.\n\nHowever in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, the Attorney General posted a screenshot from the Twitter app showing his account has been deleted.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter account deactivated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that the Minister downloaded Virtual Private Network in order to visit Twitter to deactivate it.\n\nA critical look at the photo by just clicking on it showed that indeed Malami had accessed his Twitter account with the aid of a VPN. See Also Politics REVEALED: How Malami Downloaded VPN, Logged Into Twitter To Deactivate Account\n\nThis is however not the first time the Minister would be disregarding laws made by the Buhari-led government despite being the Chief Law Officer of the country.\n\nHe has also been constantly accused of using his influence in the government to promote impunity and human rights violation.\n\nIn July 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols and guidelines were flouted during the wedding Fatiha of Malami\u2019s son, Abdulaziz, to Khadija Danbatta as guests were seen in a video dancing and communicating close to one another without wearing face masks.\n\nThe Minister was also seen in the video spraying wads of cash at the event, against the rule of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which forbids anyone from abusing the naira by spraying and stepping on them in public.

          "text": "Members of famous Indian family the Sandesaras, indicted or on the run for tax evasion, loan fraud, and other alleged offences enjoy state protection from Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria, says an investigative report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThe Sandesaras\u2014Chetankumar, his wife Diptiben, and elder brother Nitin had been on the run since 2017, when authorities in India accused them of defrauding local banks out of loans worth over $700 million at the time.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nDespite the allegations and their fugitive status, the family had been allowed to invest in projects in Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria. In fact, they hold Albanian and Nigerian passports.\n\nThe OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India. Police reports, court documents, interviews, and flight data obtained by reporters show how these officials allowed the family to move freely and continue to run their businesses while at large.\n\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nDocuments obtained by OCCRP also show that Indian state companies continued to buy hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil sourced from the Sandesaras\u2019 Nigerian firm after the family went on the run - implying that the family yet maintains ties with some state authorities in India.\n\nThe family owns Nigeria-based Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).\n\nThe brothers\u2014Nitin Sandesara and Chetankumar Sandesara\u2014control some 340 companies, including 92 outside India in energy, construction, and healthcare. Their conglomerate has claimed to be worth nearly $7 billion.\n\nAs their wealth grew, the family became a staple of the Indian tabloids, which gushed about their extravagant properties, lavish parties, and appearances with Bollywood stars. In one anecdote, Chetankumar reportedly complained to journalists when a media portal underestimated the cost of the family\u2019s new jet.\n\nBut the Sandesaras\u2019 fortunes shifted in the fall of 2017 when the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi accused them and their company of cheating and criminal conspiracy. A subsequent investigation by the Indian government\u2019s Enforcement Directorate claimed that their Sterling Biotech group had criminally acquired and laundered over $700 million for the benefit of its \u201cpromoters,\u201d including the Sandesara brothers and Diptiben.\n\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks. In 2019, the amount those banks declared as fraudulent had risen to over $1.1 billion (about N600 billion).\n\nMuch of this money was allegedly siphoned off using shell companies which listed employees and associates of Sterling Biotech as their shareholders and directors. Prosecutors say the money was transferred under the guise of asset purchases and property transactions. These transactions were also allegedly used to inflate the balance sheets of the shell companies, which then borrowed even more money from the banks and diverted those funds as well.\n\nThe Sandesaras also appear to have played politics in Kosovo. In February 2019, Kosovo\u2019s then Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj posted on Facebook that he had met with Chetankumar Sandesara, describing him as a \u201crepresentative of \u2018Sandesara Group\u2019 from Nigeria,\u201d to discuss investments in tourism and agriculture.\n\nThey have found shelter in Nigeria, along with lucrative business opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, SEEPCO partnered with Nigerian-owned Allenne Energy Ltd. on a concession licence to exploit an oil field worth over $3 billion. Nigeria\u2019s then-president Goodluck Jonathan named Sterling as one of the country\u2019s top 100 businesses in 2014.\n\nThe accusations against them back home do not seem to have troubled Nigerian officials. A month after they were charged in India, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 2016 and 2018, wrote to the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for Nitin Sandesara to be appointed honorary consul to Nigeria. She cited Nitin\u2019s \u201ceffort to expand the friendship\u201d between Nigeria and Albania and \u201cthe need to provide [an] avenue for boosting trade and investment relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAlbanian authorities immediately began the process, and Nitin received the position in January 2019, a year after he and his brother received their Albanian citizenship.\n\nIn June 2018, Nigeria\u2019s judiciary also handed down a ruling that reinforced the narrative that the Sandesaras had faced persecution by Indian authorities. The decision was made as part of a suit filed by Allenne Energy to prevent information about the Nigerian oil concession from being shared with any law enforcement agencies or banks in India or Nigeria.\n\nAllenne\u2019s suit alleged that the Indian banks were acting with \u201culterior motives\u201d and asked the court for a declaration that the \u201cchange of government in India as well as the government policies and political and religious victimization and persecution of [SEEPCO] constitute force majeure capable of raising concerns by [Allenne Energy] in protecting its interest.\u201d\n\nA judge in Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court agreed, writing that the Sandesara brothers and their families were being \u201ctargeted by Indian government agencies\u201d for their political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate for this court to allow any Nigerian company to be economically imperiled, because of political vendetta of Indian Government and banks,\u201d the judge\u2019s statement read. \u201cNigeria is keen on keeping and protecting the present legitimate investors and to even encourage more to come into the economy.\u201d\n\nLater, in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s justice ministry made a similar argument when it rejected a request from India to extradite members of the Sandesara family, citing its power to refuse requests if it believes that the offence is \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d\n\nPrashant Bhushan, the prominent public interest lawyer in India, called the High Court\u2019s decision \u201claughable,\u201d and pointed out that the Sandesaras are close to a former top Central Bureau of Investigation officer, R.K. Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

          "text": "Aisha, wife of Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, says she will prefer to die than for a ransom to be paid to kidnappers if she is abducted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been a series of abductions across the country in recent years, with kidnappers demanding ransom running into millions of naira.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday while addressing participants at a peace and security training organised for women by Equal Access International (EAI), Aisha said she supported the position of the Kaduna state government on not paying ransom to kidnappers.\n\nEl-Rufai has maintained that his government will not pay ransom to bandits, as such actions encourage more criminal activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAisha said she is ready to die in the hands of kidnappers, if it will bring peace to the country.\n\nShe urged Nigerians to support efforts to restore peace in the country, noting that women have a great role to play in achieving that.\n\n\u201cWe must sacrifice to bring this (kidnapping) to an end. I am ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to this country,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire. You are giving bandits, kidnappers money for ammunition to continue to haunt you.\n\n\u201cWe should not pay ransom. This is my personal opinion. I have said it before and I will say it again. If I am kidnapped, don\u2019t pay any ransom. Rather, pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way, and if I am going to be released, that I am not violated.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, as long as kidnappers are paid ransom, they will not change.\n\n\u201cCollectively, as a country we have to say \u2018no\u2019.

          "text": "Aisha, wife of Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, says she will prefer to die than for a ransom to be paid to kidnappers if she is abducted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been a series of abductions across the country in recent years, with kidnappers demanding ransom running into millions of naira.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday while addressing participants at a peace and security training organised for women by Equal Access International (EAI), Aisha said she supported the position of the Kaduna state government on not paying ransom to kidnappers.\n\nEl-Rufai has maintained that his government will not pay ransom to bandits, as such actions encourage more criminal activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAisha said she is ready to die in the hands of kidnappers, if it will bring peace to the country.\n\nShe urged Nigerians to support efforts to restore peace in the country, noting that women have a great role to play in achieving that.\n\n\u201cWe must sacrifice to bring this (kidnapping) to an end. I am ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to this country,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire.

If I am kidnapped, don\u2019t pay any ransom. Rather, pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way, and if I am going to be released, that I am not violated.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, as long as kidnappers are paid ransom, they will not change.\n\n\u201cCollectively, as a country we have to say \u2018no\u2019.

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Apple\u2019s planned privacy safety feature won\u2019t roll out in three censorship-heavy African countries",
          "text": "This year\u2019s edition of Apple\u2019s annual software developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), kicked off on Monday with a roughly 90-minute keynote address that saw top company executives show off a slew of new updates for major products.\n\nKey announcements made by the American technology giant included software for iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch and Apple TV, new health features, and updates to Siri, AirPods, and iCloud. In addition to these, Apple unveiled new updates focused on tightening the protection of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nA particular update that stood out from Apple\u2019s several privacy-focused measures is \u201cPrivate Relay\u201d. This new feature encrypts all browsing history and prevents third parties from intercepting the communication between your device and the server you\u2019re requesting information from. When turned on, nobody can track a user\u2019s online activity \u2013 not even the internet service provider or Apple itself. This is due to the fact that the feature uses a server maintained by a third-party operator, which will assign temporary IP addresses for users as they browse the internet.\n\nApple\u2019s use of an outside party in the relay system is intentional to prevent even the company from knowing both the user\u2019s identity and what website the user is visiting, it explained.\n\nPrivate relay is the latest in a string of efforts by Apple meant to curb the tracking of its users\u2019 browsing activity by ISPs, advertisers, and other third parties. The feature is likely to go live later this year but Apple has revealed that it won\u2019t be available in some countries due to \u201cregulatory reasons\u201d.\n\nCountries where the company will not offer private relay include South Africa, Egypt, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Philippines and China. In the latter, users live under a vast surveillance system and notorious internet censorship, and Apple has had to make several compromises on privacy to meet the demands of the ruling Communist party.\n\nIt is unsurprising to see African countries on the list of nations excluded from the private relay rollout as cutting off access to the internet and social media is common in the region. A report by privacy protection company Surfshark shows that at least 27 countries in Africa have blocked or heavily restricted social media access since 2015.\n\nLike China, those excluded by Apple have in place some kind of internet censorship regulating their citizens\u2019 online activities \u2013 often in the form of laws guiding against misinformation, hate speech, or cybercrimes \u2013 or have outrightly blocked access to social media and the internet in recent times.\n\nThe Egyptian government in particular has one of the most extensive surveillance networks in Africa and has ordered the blocking of hundreds of websites that belong to news outlets, blogs, human rights organisations, and tools such as virtual private networks used to bypass the blockades.\n\nApple is yet to disclose the outside partners it will use for the private relay system. The company also did not specify if the update will be blocked by internet providers in the countries where the feature is restricted or will simply be excluded from system upgrades for users there.",

          "title": "Exposure to risk: What tech investors fear and find interesting about Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban",
          "text": "For the second time in six months, a major government announcement is causing startup founders and investors to ponder the effect of politics and sudden regulation on doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIn February, it was the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This time it is the ban on Twitter, a social media platform that has been used for everything from crowdsourcing pro-bono lawyers for people in distress and finding missing persons, to raising capital.\n\nOn January 11 this year, the Cowrywise team received a direct message from Sahil Lavingia, a tech entrepreneur and angel investor from Silicon Valley. He had learned about the savings and wealth management startup and wanted to invest, so he reached out the best way he could \u2013 via Twitter.\n\nTwo weeks and two days later, Cowrywise closed a $3 million pre-seed round. It was led by Quona Capital, a multinational investment firm, with Lavingia and other investors participating.\n\n\u201cThe power of Twitter,\u201d Lavingia declared after the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this DM was just perfect\u2026\u201d Razaq Ahmed, Cowrywise\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nIn a different decade, startup fundraising in Africa involved long-distance travels. Primed by stories of fake companies and phantom Nigerian princes, investors needed to physically verify business authenticity, assess startup-investor chemistry and speak to customers.\n\nIn 2021, investing in Nigeria can take one DM. But this ease and perfection is now under threat.\n\nOne less medium for investor contact\n\nAfter the government ban on Twitter last week, a number of startups are anxious about using the platform.\n\nMost have suspended customer support on Twitter, while some have disclaimed that their accounts are operated outside Nigeria.\n\nThe anxiety around the ban has gotten to the international community of startup investors too.\n\nAs providers of capital, investors influence the pace and scale of innovation. Often, their decision to do so is based on perceptions about the business environment. What are they feeling and fearing about Nigeria now?\n\nIdo Sum, a partner at TLCom Capital, says the ban \u201cmay put a dampener on some foreign investments for tech companies in the short term but this is unlikely to be sustained.\u201d\n\nNigeria grabs attention for being the most populous country in Africa, with 200 million people. That number doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to the opportunity size for every startup; after all, the country\u2019s 40% poverty rate is the highest in the world.\n\n\n\nBut 81% of the country\u2019s 106 million adults have mobile phones and broadband penetration is at 40.6% \u2013 a vast improvement from 19.69% in June 2017. A growing supply of high-quality tech entrepreneurs, including from former employees of startups like Paystack and Andela, is fuelling the rise of more startups each year.\n\nSum, whose firm has invested in uLesson, Okra and Terragon among others, believes investors will continue to focus on this trend.\n\nAs the general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures, Satoshi Shinada is constantly watching the 89 companies they have invested in across 11 countries. He\u2019s had to pay particular attention to their Nigeria portfolio \u2013 which includes Decagon, Lifestores Pharmacy, Bamboo and BuyCoins \u2013 following a flurry of regulatory actions this year.\n\n\u201cI think the ban on Twitter will definitely affect investor sentiments and perception about Nigeria negatively, especially foreign investors who invest in Nigeria remotely,\u201d Shinada says.\n\nAs he describes it, Twitter has been a medium for such investors to establish contacts and engage in conversations that illuminate the market opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, he thinks that the impact will be minimal. With Nigerians finding alternative paths to retain access to Twitter, it shows that the market is resilient, keeping the investment corridor open for business.\n\nTwo other tech investors who spoke to TechCabal largely agreed with this view of the Twitter ban\u2019s possible effect on foreign investments into tech startups.\n\nFive days after internet service providers turned off the Twitter switch, the site is still being accessed through VPNs. Therefore, DMs remain open for communication between prospective investors and founding teams. It helps that such chats are never public unless one party divulges conversation history.\n\nBut even in terms of communication, other avenues exist. Email and then WhatsApp remain the major channels for hashing out term sheet details, one investor said. Zoom calls and regular phone conversations still work.\n\nMore discount on regulatory risk\n\nOne area of investment concern following the Twitter ban is \u201ca higher sense of political and regulatory risk,\u201d where unilateral decisions can put whole companies in jeopardy.\n\nBeyond assessing Nigerian startups on market size and tech gadgets penetration, there will now be a need to put a lot more discount on potential returns by taking political risk into account.\n\nBut if investors have to put a lot more political-risk discount on potential returns, would that not increase their scepticism to invest in the first place?\n\nIt would, for firms who find that the adjusted returns do not fit their investment strategy. Where a firm sets its Internal Rate of Return at 40% and gets 20% after factoring in these risks, it would be inclined to decline such opportunities.\n\nWhat that does is that an investor served with a similar opportunity in a lower-risk market, say Ghana, may likely fund the Ghanaian startup instead.\n\nThat said, investors who write million-dollar tickets and have taken a long-term view of their play in Nigeria will likely not be turned off by such discounts.\n\n\u201cFor investors like ourselves who are focused on Africa for the long term, this has no effect, and we hope that this will be the case for non Africa based investors as well, who will keep seeing the great long term potential and upside and keep increasing their exposure to the African tech ecosystem,\u201d says Sum, the TLCom Capital partner.\n\nHe also hopes that the Nigerian government will realise that bans have not worked and seek collaborations and partnerships with the \u201cvery influential\u201d tech community as a path forward.",
          "summary": "One less medium for investor contactAfter the government ban on Twitter last week, a number of startups are anxious about using the platform.\nThe anxiety around the ban has gotten to the international community of startup investors too.\n\u201cI think the ban on Twitter will definitely affect investor sentiments and perception about Nigeria negatively, especially foreign investors who invest in Nigeria remotely,\u201d Shinada says.\nTwo other tech investors who spoke to TechCabal largely agreed with this view of the Twitter ban\u2019s possible effect on foreign investments into tech startups.\nMore discount on regulatory riskOne area of investment concern following the Twitter ban is \u201ca higher sense of political and regulatory risk,\u201d where unilateral decisions can put whole companies in jeopardy.",

          "title": "Femi Iromini is improving the employability of students in Nigeria",
          "text": "Femi Iromini has been active in the African tech ecosystem for the past 5 years. As a young student, he ran many businesses\u2014 at one point, he performed due diligence for foreign investors looking to invest in African startups. Now he\u2019s focused on improving the Nigerian education system and the employability of Nigerian graduates.\n\nTo understand how he got here, let\u2019s look at his life\u2019s journey.\n\nReading Gifted Hands by Ben Carson at an early age sparked Iromini\u2019s interest in medicine. This interest was also encouraged by his secondary school teachers. He was the best student in chemistry, physics and maths so naturally, they all thought he would do well to study medicine.\n\nHe secured admission into the university and had begun studying medicine for some months before his father pulled him out of school.\n\n\u201cHe just told me that he didn\u2019t think the school was meant for me,\u201d Iromini told me.\n\nFortunately, Iromini got into university at a young age so taking an involuntary gap year wasn\u2019t too big a deal.\n\nSwitching to Geophysics\n\nIromini\u2019s switch to geophysics is a story that many may relate with. It involves a rich uncle and a desire to be as rich as the said uncle.\n\nOne day, while he was at home, this uncle came around. As they played chess, Iromini asked him what he did for a living. He worked with the oil company ExxonMobil and he had studied geophysics.\n\nIromini recalled, \u201cWhen my uncle mentioned geophysics, I thought to myself, \u2018This must be God speaking to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the career prospects of geophysics looking promising, he decided to study geophysics.\n\nA year into studying geophysics at Obafemi Awolowo University, he started questioning whether he had made the right choice.\n\nThe answer to that question came during a field trip to Ekiti. The students and lecturer had gone out to identify some rocks and minerals.\n\n\u201cDuring this field trip, a professor leading the delegates carried a boulder. I could see he was passionate about it. He then said if you really want to succeed as a geologist you need to fall in love with rocks. You need to romance rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the back, watching and listening. I didn\u2019t find that appealing. I told myself there are better things in life to romance than rocks.\u201d\n\nNone of his lecturers back at school were passionate about rocks and they didn\u2019t answer field questions with certainty. By the end of the trip, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to end up in a career related to geophysics.\n\nThat trip became a turning point for him and pushed him to attend a variety of non-academic events. He got into a number of social impact and entrepreneurial programs like the One Young World, Goldman Sachs Program, World Business Dialogue and Global University Initiative. These programs expanded his mind and opened him up to a world of possibilities.\n\nContributing to society through business\n\nDuring one of these programs, his life took a turn after Nelson Mandela charged him and other participants to focus on changing Africa by looking for ways to contribute.\n\nHe returned from the program and started businesses in school. He opened a laundry business and restaurants on three campuses. He also started a social enterprise that helped students get internships.\n\nAs he built these businesses, other students supported him. Back then, he didn\u2019t know anything about financing. He just wrote a letter soliciting contributions from his peers and they showed up. He bought his first washing machine after a \u20a620,000 ($125 at the time) contribution came in from another student.\n\nDespite the initial support he was fortunate enough to receive, he realised it was difficult to get the additional financial support he needed to build his businesses. The traditional funding channels weren\u2019t a viable option because the business didn\u2019t have a track record.\n\nDuring this phase he stumbled on Kickstarter \u2013 a crowdfunding platform. At the time, it was a new idea that opened up his mind to the concept that people can leverage their social capital to raise funds. His businesses thrived because other people believed and supported him, so he wanted to build a similar platform for others around him to raise funds.\n\nTo build this platform he collaborated with some Indian engineers he met during a program he attended years before. Building the platform took longer than expected and he spent more money than he planned to.\n\nTo increase the pace of development, he learnt a bit of coding and joined in building the platform.\n\nEventually, Crowdy, a platform that helped people in his community raise funds from family and friends, was launched. Its fundraising process was similar to the rolling fund investment model.\n\nIn 2014, fresh out of school and still running the Crowdy platform, he was approached by AXA Venture Partners, they needed help in deal analysis and sourcing for African startups.\n\n\u201cThey were looking to invest in Africa, but they weren\u2019t sure about the numbers. With Crowdy we were able to aggregate startups, especially in East Africa for them. We were more like deal aggregators.\u201d\n\nIromini and his team at Crowdy helped conduct due diligence on the startups they referred to AXA Venture Partners, they were paid for the consulting services they offered.\n\nWhile at Crowdy, Iromini also partnered with the cofounding team for the first few months of the formation of agritech company Farmcrowdy.\n\nPreparing students for employment\n\nIn 2013, while still running Crowder he enrolled in an post graduate program in innovation and entrepreneurship at Stanford University. During the program, he spent a lot of time around the Stanford campus and other neighbouring universities. He noticed a common denominator that was missing back home. In every university, there was a career center. The schools were intentional about preparing students for the world of employment.\n\nComparing this approach with his undergraduate days where there was no structure around preparing students for employment, he decided to do something about this problem.\n\n\u201cUniversities should be thinking about career outcomes. How many [of their] graduates are employed, unemployed or furthering their education. Career outcomes are a selling proposition for universities,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nThis led to the creation of Lead 360, an education technology company. The company has worked with a number of public and private universities like Covenant University and Afe Babalola.\n\nBased on the few engagements Lead 360 had with these universities, they learned that it\u2019s more than just establishing a career centre in these schools. Making students more employable requires a step by step approach.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s typically found is that in many of these schools, in the final year, a one-week seminar on employability will be organised. You\u2019re meant to have a career advisor whose performance is based on the successful employment of students. Someone who helps with internships, reviewing CVs and evaluating the interests of students,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nAs opposed to engaging with governments and universities directly, Lead 360 has adjusted its model to focus on working with institutions like the World Bank and the International Labour Organisation first, then using them to engage with the governments and universities. It has proven to be more effective.\n\nThey\u2019ve successfully collaboration with the state governments and corporate organisations to develop over 40 digital centres like one in Makoko, Yaba, Lagos.\n\nLead 360 is working on a few projects right now. Top on the list is a labour market information system. A system that informs the government and universities on what skillsets employers are looking for and how many students have these skillsets in real time. This project is funded by international agencies.\n\nIt also has other solutions for students like career services, a learning management system, a transcript management system, and an education financing product.\n\nAs someone who has always sought to solve problems around him, Iromini is taking the Nigerian education system heads on.\n\nBy 2050, Africa is going to have a large population with Nigeria at the forefront, he is constantly asking himself, \u201cwhat are we going to do with this population?\u201d",

          "text": "It\u2019s a revolutionary feature that helps clients evaluate and choose Master Traders\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a popular service that allows clients to profit by copying trades from professional traders, also known as Master Traders. The company recently introduced Risk Score\u2014a game-changing feature that enables copiers to choose Master Traders based on the risk of their trading strategy.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a top-rated service among the company\u2019s clients. There are two great reasons for its popularity. First, you can access the service with just one tap through the OctaFX Copytrading app or the desktop version. Second, you need zero Forex expertise to start making a profit.\n\nWondering how it works? The clients, known as copiers, choose professional traders, known as Master Traders, to copy their trades. Whenever a Master Trader opens an order, the same order opens in a copier\u2019s account automatically. That way, a copier can simply trust a Master Trader\u2019s expertise and profit with minimum effort.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose a Master Trader wisely and invest your funds securely. For this reason, OctaFX offers a Master Rating, where the best traders are placed at the top. Previously, they were evaluated only by their profitability and popularity. Now OctaFX took it to the next level.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading introduced Risk Score\u2014a new feature that shows how risky each Master Trader\u2019s strategy is. The score is calculated by a special algorithm and depends on a Master Trader\u2019s average profit, number of orders, and how stable their strategy is. The introduction of Risk Score is fundamental because copiers can now choose a Master Trader based not only on their profit but also on their strategy. Master Traders who score 1 or 2 on a 6-point scale apply more stable, long-term oriented, and less risky strategies.\n\nOctaFX hopes that with this new feature, their copy trading clients will be able to choose Master Traders who best suit their preferences.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2021 \u2018Best Forex Broker Asia\u2019 award and the 2020 \u2018Most Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

We even had some lawyers discuss the legality of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the resumption of plenary duties, the House set up a Committee on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nWhat has been said? The speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, ordered the Committee to investigate the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s ban and report to the house within 10 days.\n\nHe noted that the legislative body recognised the value of social media as a tool for communication and commerce in the country but insisted that it must be balanced with the need to protect national interests.\n\nExternal pressure? Various bodies, including High Commissions and Embassies of foreign nations spoke out against the Twitter ban. However, this is the first response by the country\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nUber and Bolt drivers set to partner with local companies\n\nFighting back? The National President, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Idris Shonuga, has announced plans by members of the body to ditch Uber and Bolt in favor of local companies, Active Rides and My Cab App.\n\nThe drivers hope that this new arrangement would improve their welfare and customer service while giving the Association a greater say in decisions affecting its members.\n\nRecall that in April 2021, riders on Uber and Bolt drivers embarked on a week long warning strike. They called on the ride-hailing companies to review prices in line with increased living expenses in the country.\n\nUber responded with a 13% price hike for its UberX offering. However, it appears that the drivers remain dissatisfied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe not enough: While it seems drivers are getting improved conditions with this new arrangement, it is not yet clear how the Association\u2019s plan to partner with the local ride-hailing companies would play out. Its success would most likely hinge on users\u2019 adoption of the two partners which are relatively unknown.\n\nGo deeper with this article: Uber, Bolt drivers move to dump ride hailing companies, partner with indigenous firms\n\nBolt unveils electric tuk-tuks in Kenya\n\nBolt Foods electric motorcycles.

          "title": "Global EV adoption: The reality in Africa may be different",
          "text": "A decade ago, the notion that Electric Vehicles (EVs) could be an alternative to the popular gas vehicles was unthinkable. Then, electric vehicles were more for research & development projects and the few that roamed the roads were so expensive that they were exclusive to the rich.\n\nHowever, thanks to technological advancements, evolving policies and the growing popularity of EV companies like Jet Motor Company, EVs are now sharing the same roads with conventional vehicles. And some regions already perceived it as the future of transportation.\n\nAccording to reports, the adoption of EVs across the globe is rapidly gaining steam. It is estimated that adoption has increased more than six-fold since 2015.\n\nLast year, over 11 million registered electric vehicles including cars, buses, vans and trucks were on the road across the world. This number is projected to rise to 145 million by the end of the decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of different EV car models available in the market has risen to 370\n\nIn terms of sales, the past year was similarly a ground-breaking one for EVs. Sales grew globally by 41% in 2020 despite the 16% pandemic related drop in overall car sales across the world.\n\nEurope overtook China as the centre of the global electric car market for the first time. The region saw electric car sales of 3 million, with registrations doubling to 1.4 million, while in China\u2019s increased to 1.2 million.\n\nChina has been the world\u2019s largest market since 2015. It has almost five million EVs, accounting for more than half of the world\u2019s total, according to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.\n\nThe US and Africa still lag in the transition to EVs. However, while the world\u2019s biggest economy has started adopting measures that would benefit the adoption soon, Africa has shown little progress.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) says the huge gap in adoption between regions is related to the level of the challenges affecting the EVs growth.\n\nEVs Challenges in Africa\n\nElectric vehicles remain rare in most of Africa, the probability of finding one is about one in a million. In South Africa, which is thought to be the largest EV market on the continent, only 1,000 out of more than 12 million vehicles on its roads are EVs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven fewer electric cars are in operation in most other African countries. This is because the most popular vehicles are second-hand cars.\n\nReports estimated that about 40% of the global exports of used vehicles go to Africa. Specifically, in Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia it is estimated that the proportion reaches about 80\u201390% of total vehicles imported.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nHowever, this might not change soon. Unlike Europe where government policies are forcing automotive markets to embrace more climate-friendly options like Evs, Africa\u2019s governments are more relaxed.\n\nOnly one African country, Cape Verde, has taken steps to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by targeting an end to imports of such vehicles by 2035.\n\nIn comparison, about 17 countries have made similar laws across Asia, Europe and America. In addition to that, many of the countries pledge to SDGs net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPoor Infrastructure \u2013 Roads, Electricity, EV chargers\n\nSecondly, even the relatively slow adoption of EVs in Africa faces infrastructural challenges like weak electricity grids, Bad roads and lack of public E-chargers.\n\nWhile grids in Europe have been able to cope with electric mobility, electricity systems in many African countries are already under strain. Frequent blackouts in some countries could limit consumer demand for electric cars, as it cuts off access to transport.\n\nFor example, in Nigeria, the average access to electricity is about 12 hours and there are no known public EV charging stations in the country.\n\nThings are a bit better in SouthAfrica. The country is ranked fifth globally in the ratio of public electric vehicle (EV) chargers to electric vehicles in 2020. Only Korea, Chile, Mexico, and the Netherlands have more chargers per EV.\n\nHowever, that is just one out of 54 countries that are on the continent.\n\nInsufficient charging infrastructure continues to prevent wider use, as does the low supply of appropriate electric vehicles in many sectors, such as heavy industry.\n\nLess than the average cost of living\n\nThe cost of EVs have dropped drastically over the years, the advancement in Battery Technology and the huge investment in EV startups have made buying an EV affordable.\n\nHowever, despite falling battery costs, the promise of savings over the lifetime of an EV from lower fuel and maintenance costs, the upfront prices remain out of the range of average Africa.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, the average cost of a new electric vehicle is about $55,600 (N23M). This is way above the average yearly salary of N2M made by the average Nigerian living in Lagos.\n\nA local solution\n\nDespite the many problems plaguing the adoption of EVs in Africa, A handful of startups and companies in several countries are building electronic vehicles to push adoption within the continent.\n\nThese companies are finally bringing the electric-car revolution to the streets of Africa with the production of electric-vehicle fleets of light carriers and motorcycles\u2014vehicles well suited for the continent\u2019s challenging roads.\n\nWith smart technologies and appropriate regulation, these EVs could become an asset rather than a threat to grid stability, through dynamic charging and vehicle-to-grid applications.\n\nWhile electricity systems in many African countries are currently limited, they are expanding fast: power generation capacity is expected to more than double by 2040.\n\nAfrica has the smallest per-capita car ownership level of any region in the world. Transportation using buses, taxis and motorcycles are more popular than personal cars, this shows that it may be better suited to electrification first.\n\nIn addition, the shift to transport electrification will be far easier to manage if it is factored into grid upgrades at an early stage, instead of taking grid operators by surprise further down the line to consumers.\n\nSome examples of these startups are Kenya-based ARC Ride launched electric two- and three-wheelers for UberEats deliveries in Nairobi. In Kigali, Rwandan start-up Ampersand is introducing a fleet of electric motorcycle taxis and plans to expand to other East African countries.\n\nIn Uganda, locally manufactured electric buses from Kiira Motors have started transporting passengers in Kampala. Finally in Nigeria, Jet Motor Company has partnered with GIG Logistics to provide its EVs for both transport and logistics services in the Nigerian market.\n\nIn Summary\n\nWhile progress is being made, electric cars currently make up 1% of the global fleet. And significant barriers to the wholesale adoption of EVs remain. The report predicts that with even bolder climate programmes and emission reduction targets, there could be up to 230 million electric vehicles on our streets \u2013 12% of all road transport \u2013 by 2030.\n\nSimilarly in Africa, SDG scenarios are predicting around 40% of light vehicles in Africa are electric by 2050.\n\nWith market forces gaining momentum, consumer consciousness on the rise and the emergence of Local EV companies this forecast is not impossible.\n\nHowever, for Africa to become a fast-growing source of demand for electric transport, governments and investors need to support these innovations to scale up and accelerate adoption.",

          "title": "War against everybody",
          "text": "The Buhari regime like NEPA, had no friends. They came to power proclaiming themselves friends of the people. They had come, so they assured an unsuspecting populace to save them from the suffocating embrace of the politicians. But a few weeks after the duo of Muhammadu Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon marched triumphantly into Dodan Barracks, the seat of government, Nigerians were already asking themselves; \u201cWith friends like these, who needs enemies?\u201d\n\nThe self-styled off-shoot government of the decisive Muhammed/Obasanjo regime did not move fast to make it appear as if it deliberately wanted to estrange itself from the society. This its top men did with an unparalleled arrogance and unnecessary combativeness, a mindless witch-hunting and needless antagonism against all sections of the populace. It was like a death wish.\n\nThe government\u2019s hostile attitude was so suffocating that it was commonplace for Idiagbon to appear on the television network and in his usual aggressive manner pronounce: \u201cYou are warned to abide by \u2026.\u201d When he was not warning people, he was threatening to \u201cdeal ruthlessly\u201d with anyone who dared disagree. On one occasion when Idiagbon smiled, it made headline news. It was that bad.\n\nThere had not been any government in the history of Nigeria that had so blatantly disregarded public opinion as did the Buhari regime. The ousted head of state\u2019s standard reply whenever a slight pressure built up on any particular issue was \u201cwe cannot be rushed.\u201d The country was run as a personal fiefdom, an apparatus to use in settling personal scores.\n\nThe first indication of this came when he granted his first interview to the local press. When Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu and Yakubu Mohammed, then with the Concord asked what his government\u2019s attitude to the press would be. Buhari went into a fit of anger. \u201cl will surely tamper with press freedom.\u201d he said, almost shouting.\n\nHis reason was that he was embarrassed with the allegedly missing N2.8 billion oil money reports which broke after he left the government of Obasanjo as Commissioner for Petroleum in 1979. And that was how the infamous decree number four which stipulated a jail term for a journalist who published an embarrassing report about a public Official, even if it was true, came into being.\n\nRead Also: What a Netflix Documentary Taught me About Buhari\u2019s War on Everybody\n\nEven in anticipation of the official promulgation of the decree, it was already being put into use when four months into its tenure, the government ordered the arrest and detention of Tunde Thompson and Nduka Irabor, both reporters of The Guardian. The government was piqued because of a minor report concerning ambassadorial postings. Shortly after, the decree was published and a special tribunal chaired by Olalere Ayinde was set up to try the two reporters.\n\nDespite a massive outpouring of public demonstrations, including pleas from traditional rulers and some of Buhari\u2019s former bosses, both journalists were tried and convicted, they were arrested on April 4 and jailed on June 4 under Decree 4, the alienation of the press and the public had set in.\n\nHarassment of journalist did not stop there. Almost every month in their first year, one newspaper editor or another was detained for the slightest excuse. Duro Onabule, editor of National Concord was arrested and detained at least thrice. Once for two weeks; Haroun Adamu editorial adviser of The Punch, a man Buhari had personal animosity against was detained until the government was toppled last week. also kept in jail till the end came for Buhari government was Rufai Ibrahim ex-editor of The Guardian (Sunday) for writing an open letter to Balarabe Musa, the former radical governor of Kaduna state who was impeached by a conservative opposition in 1980.\n\nIn the same boat were Hamza, editor Of Amana, the Hausa language newspaper of the Concord group, Leke Salawu of the Triumph, and only one month ago, Bukar Zarma, editor of New Nigerian and Aliyu Babatunde Ahmed, editor of Sunday New Nigerian.\n\nThe deposed government tried other means to cripple the press as well. There are deliberate policy to starve newspapers of raw materials, especially newsprint. This was done through ridiculously low import license allocation and extremely high import duties. It was so bad at one point that many newspapers retrenched staff and cut their print run and reduced pagination to eight. The government also imported newsprint through the Nigerian Newsprint manufacturing company at Oku Iboku, Itu, for sale to newspapers.\n\nThe government was still not satisfied. It unearthed a dormant directive restricting federal government advertisement placement to the Daily Times and the New Nigerian. Buhari\u2019s press secretary, who has also now lost his job later explained in the government\u2019s usual bland manner that the \u201crevenue-saving measure\u201d was \u201ctemporary.\u201d Till the dying days of his government. Buhari continued to threaten the press, especially the privately owned ones, with closure\n\nIf the press went through its worst period ever, including the sentencing to jail of journalists for the first time, labour had a worse experience. The leadership of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) was completely emasculated so much that the NLC president Ali Chiroma became redundant and irrelevant. There was a sustained effort at embarrassing the union leaders. Only recently, when he visited Allison Madueke, Anambra state governor until last week, Chiroma was subjected to an undignifying body search.\n\nThe impotence of the labour leadership led to the disgraceful booing of NLC officials and then labour, Minister, Solomon Omojokun on May Day, workers day of celebration. This year Omojokun represented Buhari who considered it below his dignity to attend the celebration, if only as a token of concern following the most massive retrenchment of workers in Nigeria\u2019s history. As Chiroma got up to read his address, a pall fell over the gathering of several thousand workers who responded to the speech with a rumbling boo. Omojokun received the same treatment. In a touching side action, a little boy of about six displayed a placard that read; \u201cplease give my daddy a job.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari government, which had promised to clear a backlog of unpaid salaries on coming to power, did not fulfil this promise, instead, the situation became worse leading some states to engage in rationing salaries. A notable example was the \u201cImo formula,\u201d which the Imo state government devised to pay workers \u201cwhatever money we have in hand.\u201d Niger state copied the \u201cformula\u201d in the final months.\n\nAny kind of organised labour or pressure group was treated with high-handedness. The Airline Pilots and Flight Engineers Association (APFEAN) fell early in 1984. The association was banned when pilots of Nigerian Airways, the national carrier, embarked on a strike over conditions of service and lack of safety facilities, including radars and instruments landing system (ILS) at the nation\u2019s airports. The pilots were fired. After a new employment screening was carried out, 14 of the pilots were dismissed. The government did its best to discourage other employers from giving them jobs.\n\nThe doctors were to follow the pilots later. In September 1984, after months of warning, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) decided to hold the Buhari regime to its promise. When Brigadier Sanni Abacha announced the change of government in December 1983 he gave the deplorable state of medicare as one of the major reasons for the take-over. After waiting nine months and nothing was forthcoming, the NMA called its members out on strike reminding the government of Abacha\u2019s statement on the coup date that the nation\u2019s hospital had become mere consulting clinics. Out of character, the government called a truce and a stop-gap quickly ferried in N4 million worth of drugs and medicaments through the UNICEF, the crisis came to a temporary end.\n\nFive months later in February this year, the health sector continued to suffer terribly from government inactions. Virtually everything was in short supply, from dressings to potable water for hospitals. So the doctors went on strike again, after putting the government on notice. But this time Buhari replied with a big stick. The NMA was banned, and its leaders, including the president Edmundson Thompson-Akpabio and the first vice-president, Beko Ransome-Kuti, were packed off into detention.\n\nBefore some of them were picked up, their families were harassed, and Akpabio\u2019s children were detained for a few days. Other leaders of the doctors\u2019 association, like Boniface Oyo-Adeniran, Wole Atoyebi, and Ayo Falope fled through bush paths to Britain and the United States to escape the terror of what was becoming a fascist regime. Last week, President Babangida maintained in a broadcast that hospitals still remained \u201cmere consulting clinics.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s intelligentsia, like other sections of the society, was hounded into submission. University lecturers were barred from talking to foreign media. Facilities in higher institutions were also stopped from being used for \u201csubversive activities\u201d, a catch-phrase of Idiagbon meaning lectures, symposia, and student rallies and meetings. The opposition to academia was so much that Idiagbon identified campus \u201csubversive elements\u201d, including a college rag at the University of Ife called Cobra, The newsletter was actually a gossip periodical that published materials similar to those found in Lagos Weekend.\n\nMany lecturers especially officials of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), were randomly picked up and detained. Among those dumped behind bars were Tunde Fatunde, then secretary of ASUU in the University of Benin, and an activist at the University of Ibadan, Ola Oni. To further cow the academic community, the government directed that lecturers should be retrenched, and the process was in full gear at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Ibadan, Lagos, and Nsukka Universities.\n\nUniversity students had an especially raw deal. Following the introduction of higher feeding and accommodation fees in early 1984, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) entered into negotiations with Yerima Abdullahi, then Minister of Education. When the talks appeared bogged down, the government, true to type, promptly declared that it no longer recognised the association it had been negotiating with and warned students to behave or face its usual punishment \u2014 detention.\n\nThe students soon embarked on a nationwide boycott of lectures, which was broken when the universities were closed down and the students sent home. On many occasions, student leaders were arrested and detained, including the president of the \u201cunrecognised\u201d NANS, Lanre Arogundade. Two months ago, when some student leaders from the universities met in Port Harcourt in the night, police were waiting for them. They broke up the meeting and arrested some who were later released when the students threatened to go on demonstrations. The Ife University student leader, in a classical Gestapo style, was lured to a post office where he was arrested.\n\nThe Buhari government managed to stir up some trouble on religion as well. It cut a traditional two-day Christian Easter holiday to one, but back-pedalled after protests from the Christian Council of Churches. When it decided to import rams for the Muslim Id-el-Kabir festival, Christians were quick to remind the government to import turkey for Christians. Meanwhile, the fundamentalist Maitasine Islamic sect continued to kill people mindlessly, and the government seemed incapable, despite assurances to the contrary, of controlling the riots.\n\nEven traditional rulers, who were described by Buhari as \u201chighways to national unity\u201d, felt the regime\u2019s iron fist. Two of the foremost traditional rulers, the Ooni of Ife and Emir of Kano were punished for paying a private visit to Israel \u201cwithout official permission\u201d. The two \u201chighways of national unity\u201d were stripped of official functions and restricted to their respective domains for six months.\n\nAnother aspect of Buhari\u2019s war against everybody was one which wrought disaster in virtually every home in the land. The first was the mass retrenchment of workers, for which the government declared that it would not make amends even if someone were unjustly sent into the throes of unemployment. In addition, nobody could challenge his retrenchment in court, by force of the decree. Last May, the NLC said unemployed people had passed the one million mark. Simultaneous with the retrenchments, all the state governments embarked on an orgy of demolition of market stalls and homes in the name of environmental sanitation. Millions of petty businesses were ruined, and millions of people left heartbroken. There were many families in which every member was unemployed: the husband retrenched, the wife\u2019s stall demolished, and the school leaver kid unable to get a job.\n\nFor the houses bulldozed, especially in Lagos, the government later found that many of them might have been wrongly wiped out. Solution: a government promised to set up a probe panel to look into grievances and that was the end of the matter. And then there were the levies slapped on the poverty-stricken from just about every direction. There were levies in most states of the federation for development, education, radio set, television set, and involuntary donations.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Bendel State, the governor, Jerry Useni not reputed for finesse in handling state matters, ordered that \u201cenvironmental sanitation levies\u201d be collected from travellers passing through Bendel during the Muslim Id-el-Kabir festival. Those who could not pay had to pass through another state to their destinations. The indiscriminate levies elicited a bitter sarcasm from Stanley Macebuh, Executive Editor of The Guardian. \u201cCall Me Levy\u201d, he admonished in an article.\n\nThe environmental sanitation programme was sometimes carried to unreasonable extents. Many of the states closed offices at noon or shortly after so that all civil servants could spend three or four hours extra to clear refuse dumps and clean the road and drains. Motorist in Oyo state for instance were usually forced to cart away the rubbish in their car booths. The target of all the effort; a N1 million prize promised by the sacked federal government for the cleanest state in Nigeria.\n\nSchool fees were reintroduced in certain parts of the country which hitherto enjoyed free education, much to the chagrin but helplessness of the people. it was worst in Oyo state, where primary school fees were introduced for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWhile the government floundered, it engaged in frivolities, Ondo state found time to erase Obafemi Awolowo\u2019s name from the signboard of the state university. Detention without trials was not restricted to politicians and journalists alone. Schoolteacher Tai Solarin was detained for more than a year before his release last month. So also was Sule Katagum, former chairman of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), their offences were that they made pronouncements that were not sweet to Buhari\u2019s or Idiagbon\u2019s ears.\n\nThe execution of drug pushers against the overwhelming objection of the society was a clear instance of the government\u2019s refusal to listen to the populace. It was a regime that refused to change its mind even if it made mistakes so that it would appear tough. The stubbornness provoked an exasperated Wole Soyinka, the Buhari government\u2019s most persistent critic into a kind of discomforting resignation. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to deaf people\u201d, he said. It was a surprise to many people that he was not detained until the regime fell.\n\nPerceived double standards in the handling of issues were also a major source of disillusionment. There was the case of Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, former permanent secretary in the federal ministry of finance. He lost thousands of pounds of his personal money to Austrian-thieves while on an official trip abroad. He could not explain how he came about such money since civil servants are not allowed by law to keep foreign accounts. The uproar did not move the Buhari administration, which merely reposted Abubakar to the ministry of national planning, with a Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) board membership to the bargain. Both Melford Okilo and Sam Mbakwe, former governors of Rivers and Imo States respectively were jailed for the same offence, Abubakar Alhaji is still in government.\n\nThe 53 suitcases issue also generated heated debate. During the currency exchange exercise in April and May last year, tight controls were clamped on the airports and other inlets. Anybody found carrying the old currency was arrested and detained. But a retired ambassador and an emir brought in 53 suitcases during the period, and the luggage was forcibly cleared without being checked in full view of everyone at the Murtala Muhammed Airway in Lagos. The soldier who threw his weight around was Major Jokolo, Buhari\u2019s aide-de-camp. The government has not been able to explain it away satisfactorily. And it haunted the government forever.\n\nThese and other blunders drove wedges between different sections of the community, and the divisions inevitably led to impassioned calls for confederation, occasioned, perhaps, by a sense of alienation felt by certain sections of the country. The government was getting jittery, and its ad-hoc solution, true to character, was to ban all debates on the political future of Nigeria, any newspaper which published such debates, warned by the Buhari regime, would be closed down. And so the stalemate continued.\n\nYou can force the horse to the pond, but you cannot force it to drink. The society drifted farther and farther away from the rulership, and the government inevitably could not get anything done. Instead of a war against poverty, corruption, and illiteracy, the Buhari administration waged a war against the people of Nigeria, and discredited the armed forces in the process, making President Babangida\u2019s first task that of putting an end to the war on everybody.\n\nThis article, culled from Newswatch, was first published on 9 September 1985",
          "summary": "There had not been any government in the history of Nigeria that had so blatantly disregarded public opinion as did the Buhari regime.\nIn September 1984, after months of warning, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) decided to hold the Buhari regime to its promise.\nAnother aspect of Buhari\u2019s war against everybody was one which wrought disaster in virtually every home in the land.\nWhile the government floundered, it engaged in frivolities, Ondo state found time to erase Obafemi Awolowo\u2019s name from the signboard of the state university.\nInstead of a war against poverty, corruption, and illiteracy, the Buhari administration waged a war against the people of Nigeria, and discredited the armed forces in the process, making President Babangida\u2019s first task that of putting an end to the war on everybody.",

          "text": "Despite Nigeria\u2019s large population and natural geographical advantages, its airlines are missing out on processing more of passenger traffic within Africa.\n\nExperts say absence of international partnerships, a vibrant national carrier and data sharing among airlines and global aviation bodies have restricted Nigerian carriers to local competition, while Ethiopia, Egypt, Morocco and others rake in millions of dollars from passenger traffic within Africa.\n\nA recent data released by the African Airlines Association (AFRAA) on African airlines ranking by traffic show that Nigeria is missing as regards domestic, intra-Africa and international traffic.\n\nAirlines that top the list with the highest passenger traffic for domestic, intra-Africa and intercontinental flights include Ethiopian Airlines of Ethiopia, Egypt Air of Egypt, Royal Air Moroc of Morocco, Safair of South Africa, Kenya Airways of Kenya, Air Algeria of Algeria, Air Arabia Moroc of Morocco, Tunisair of Tunisia, Mongo Airlines of South Africa and Comair of South Africa.\n\nIn 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines carried more than 13.3 million passengers that year.\n\nEgypt Air carried almost 8.9 million passengers in the year to May 2019. The Star Alliance member is one of the largest airlines in Africa and currently flies to more than 70 destinations around the world.\n\nFrom its base at Mohammed V International Airport, Royal Air Moroc of Morocco operates a domestic network in Morocco, scheduled international flights to Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America, and occasional charter flights that include Hajj services.\n\nOn the other hand, 22 domestic and international carriers operating in Nigeria put together are able to process between 13 and 15 million passengers annually, almost equivalent to what only Ethiopian Airline processed.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that Air Peace, Nigeria\u2019s largest carrier, processes about 35 percent of the passenger traffic in Nigeria.\n\nWhile majority of the 10 highlighted African carriers with the highest traffic are government-owned or government-backed entities and a few others wholly-owned or affiliates to international airlines or bodies, experts argue that domestic carriers can only play in the international league if they could partner big airlines to get the backing and funding that could enable them get a fair share of international traffic.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa attempts Southwest effect on air travel in Nigeria\n\nNigeria has continued to lose out because it does not have a government-owned or national carrier that can fully benefit from bilateral agreements and reciprocity related issues, such as getting landing permits or slots in other international airports and destinations, Seyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, says.\n\nAdewale also notes that local airline operators do not have aircraft that can fly long hauls, and the ones that have attempted to do not have the financial power to maintain such routes on a long-term basis, although they are learning quickly.\n\n\u201cFor domestic passenger consideration, our local airlines do not have interlined agreements as was with Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Nigeria,\u201d he explains.\n\nFor instance, ComAir feeds from British Airways international flights and is part of the One-World Alliance and utilises this advantage when the need arises.\n\nFurthermore, Mango Airlines is a low-cost carrier part of South African Airways.\n\nThe government-backed airlines enjoy some form of grants, subventions and opportunistic privileges; whereas the international affiliated airlines ride on the opportunities provided by their parent partner or owner.\n\n\u201cPrimarily and in my opinion, Nigeria needs a National Carrier to quickly achieve the passenger traffic results and its local carriers need to procure or lobby government support in order to actively bargain good slots on international routes,\u201d he suggests.\n\nAmong Nigerian domestic carriers, Air Peace is the only carrier currently operating international flights to Dubai and South Africa and some West African countries.\n\nMedview Airline, which commenced the Dubai route about four years ago, barely operated the route for a few months and suspended the route citing depleting fleet.\n\nArik Air once operated flights to Johannesburg, New York and London but could not sustain those routes.\n\nExperts say these airlines failed to sustain international operations because they did not get the needed government support, and did not have partnerships with reputable international airlines.\n\nFor Olumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, the failure of Nigerian airlines to share data on their traffic and performance with global aviation bodies and global sites has left many of the airlines still struggling to feed local routes.\n\n\u201cThe recent data released by AFRAA show that Nigerian airlines cannot operate alone and expect everybody to see them. A South African comes from South Africa to Nigeria and has to stop in Nairobi for two hours to connect flights to Nigeria because he does not know a Nigerian carrier operates direct flight from SA to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen you are not on global websites, you don\u2019t submit your data, you don\u2019t show your schedules so that everybody can see it, then you are not helping your business,\u201d Ohunayo explains.\n\nThe world is moving with data, information and social media and global sites generate traffic and figures that people use to analyse performance and know capabilities of airlines, he says.\n\nEven data from Nigeria\u2019s aviation regulatory authorities are not being taken seriously because the figures are not accurate, he notes, but suggests airlines improve their appearance on social media outlets and on aviation data services organisations and be members of AFRAA in a bid to access subsidised aviation fuel and maintenance.\n\nHe however commends Ibom Air and Dana Air on their interline partnership that would result in increased visibility and available seats, and more airlines can learn from this initiative.",

          "title": "Ban: Twitter, Others Must Be Licensed, Registered In Nigeria \u2013 Federal Govt",
          "text": "The federal government has listed some conditions to lift the suspension on Twitter operations in Nigeria, saying it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern.\n\nApart from Twitter, the government said other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram must be registered in the country.\n\nMinister of Information, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the virtual federal executive council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to him,Twitter has reached out to the federal government seeking high-level discussion to resolve the issue saying that he got the message on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe insisted that the microblogging platform was suspended because it provided an avenue for people that are threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the owner of Twitter helped to fund the recent #EndSARS protest while allowing the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to use the platform to call for the killing of policemen.\n\nHe said Twitter failed to take down Kanu\u2019s tweets despite repeated requests to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cas you are aware, last Friday the federal government suspended Twitter operations in Nigeria indefinitely. And the reason we gave was because of the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOn Friday, also the government directed the regulatory body, the National Broadcasting commission, to immediately commenced the process of licencing all OTT, Over The Top social media operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that you\u2019ve done that I think by today, that advert is out asking that all Ott, and social media coverage operating in Nigeria should apply for registration and licensing.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that is because Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence that is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecause, we\u2019ve found out that Twitter is actually the platform of choice for a particular separatist leader who resides outside the country and issues directives to its members to attack symbols of government authority, such as the police, the military, the Electoral Commission offices, correctional centres, etc.\n\n\u201cAnd this is being done willfully and consistently without any consequences from Twitter. You know, no country worth its name will tolerate that. And no company, no matter its self importance will force any nation to accept this.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that most of the Ott and social media platforms operating in Nigeria do not have any office in Nigeria and do not pay taxes to Nigerian government for the billions they earn here.\n\n\u201cThat is not the best practice globally, and that is why we are insisting that for you to operate in Nigeria you must first be a Nigerian company and be licenced by the broadcasting commission.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any Ott or social media platform operating in Nigeria must do so legally. One, registered with Corporate affairs Commission, the licence by National Broadcasting commission and then adhere to the conditions stipulated in their licences.\n\n\u201cWe have already advertised the notice to the companies concerned to apply for registration of licence.\u201d\n\nMohammed further explained that freedom of speech has not been stifled by the suspension of Twitter as he maintained that to Nigerians can still use other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHe also denied that the suspension is not effective arguing that that Twitter is losing money as a result of the action.\n\nHe stated, \u201cfor those that have heard that , the ban is not effective, to the best of my knowledge, I think the ban is very effective. Otherwise, how would they be complaining that they are losing billions of Naira everyday if the ban is not effective.\n\n\u201cBut that is not the issue. Many one of the commentators that have said suspending the operation of Twitter is like stifling freedom of expression. And I said no. Twitter is just one of the many platforms through which Nigerians can express themselves. There is Facebook, there is Instagram, there\u2019s WhatsApp. There\u2019s Google Hangout, and others. They have not been suspended.\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, like I have said in several fora, it is because we have a country called Nigeria that we can start talking about free speech. And of course, there has to be a country before people can able to transact their businesses using social media platforms.\n\n\u201cWhen I addressed you on Wednesday, I said, among other things that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect. And I went further to say yes that Twitter funded the Endsars protests in Nigeria last year.\n\n\u201cAnd people have challenged it. And I\u2019m glad that the Cable has done some fact finding and their conclusions are as follows: they said the truth is that, fact checking showed that indeed, Twitter played a prominent role in helping to raise funds for the endsars protesters.\n\n\u201cWhether they paid directly, helped to pay or helped to raise funds, it\u2019s a matter of semantics. And here is what the factcheck the online newspaper revealed: A, that on October 14 2020. \u2026.. retweeted an article about the protests with the endsars hashtag alongside a link to the feminist coalition, one of the groups providing support for the protesters at the time. B, that on the same date, he asked people to donate via bitcoins to support the movement. C, on October 16, Dussen launched a special emoji to give the protesters more visibility on the microblogging platform.\n\n\u201cSo, whether donated money himself or help to raise money, the tweeter owner is one of those who helped to fund the endsars protests that was later hijacked leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cWe must never forget the toll of the endsars protests. Six soldiers and several policemen were killed. Policemen were injured, vehicles were destroyed, 134 police stations were burnt down, 57 civilians were killed. 269 private corporate facilities were burnt or looter and vandalise, 243 government facilities were burnt or vandalized, 81 government warehouses were looted.\n\n\u201clike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the factcheck the role of Jack Dossy is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth. Our decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some, it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd until when Twitter responds and the cardinal thing is that Twitter must be registered in Nigeria. Twitter must be licenced in Nigeria and Twitter must stop using its platform for activities that are inimical to the growth of Nigeria and its corporate existence,\u201d he added.",

Even though anyone or organisation committed to doing good will keep doing so with or without recognition, recognitions for virtue tend to act like a shot in the arm for such people or organisations, spurring them to commit even more to doing good.\n\nThat is what the recent award of \u201cRetail Banking CEO of the Year Nigeria\u201d to Dr Adesola Adeduntan, CEO of First Bank of Nigeria Limited, is to both him and the bank he leads. It is a shot in the arm of this foremost CEO of Nigeria\u2019s most enduring financial institution that is also the pioneer in retail banking development in Nigeria, the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial inclusion services provider in Nigeria for over 127 years, to keep steering the bank in the right direction, energising and expanding retail opportunities for all Nigerians in the process. It is a well-deserved recognition for a man and the institution he leads that would rather keep off the spotlight and focus exclusively on attending to Nigerians\u2019 banking needs as best as they can \u2013 which is what has kept them going for 127 years and counting.\n\nThis critical role is one FirstBank is better suited to lead than any other lender given the robust retail banking framework that the bank has in place, that is riding on its innovative technology-driven operations, over 750 branches across the continents and 100,000 Firstmonie Agent banking network spread across 772 local government areas in Nigeria. It is little wonder that FirstBank, which is intricately woven into the fabric of the Nigerian society, has been an essential player in the retail space, empowering Nigerians of all walks of life by providing them bespoke and innovative financial products and services that address their multidimensional needs.

Dr Adeduntan reiterates this view when he wasted no time in dedicating the award to all the bank\u2019s \u201ccustomers, as the trust they reposed in us being their bank of first choice in meeting their business and financial needs has been instrumental to the success we have achieved in our existence of over 127 years.\u201d \u201cWe remain committed,\u201d he continued, \u201cto putting you, our customers, first as we contribute to the growth and development of our host communities.\u201d\n\nOrganised to identify the banks across the world that have excelled across a number of areas, including corporate governance, sustainability and innovation, and have played a key role in the industry\u2019s growth, the Global Banking and Finance Awards reflect the innovation, achievement, strategy, progressive and inspirational changes taking place within the global financial community.

          "title": "The TWITTER Ban, Prosecution ,More Prisons And The Link With The JUSUN Strike -NigPilot",
          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, has just ordered the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to immediately prosecute offenders contravening the Federal Government\u2019s ban on twitter operations in Nigeria. Indeed he wants the DPP to liaise with the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, the National Communications Commission (NCC) and other relevant Government agencies to ensure \u201cspeedy prosecution of offenders without further delay\u201d.\n\nHow I wish that Malami\u2019s APC Government, has displayed such alacrity and sense of urgency on the grave insecurity challenges of the country; the parlous economy and the mounting corruption ravaging our land.\n\nMalami did this with Lai Mohammed apparently being aware that many knowledgeable Nigerians had started to use different Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to clearly bypass the blockage. This government must be ready to build thousands of prisons across all the nooks and cranies of Nigeria so as to accommodate the deluge of \u2018erring\u2019 Nigerians.\n\nTHE DANGERS INHERENT IN GOVERNMENT\u2019S ILLEGAL ACTION\n\nThis government does not appear to have weighed carefully the serious implications of its actions and the likely ricochetting effects. Many Nigerians run global businesses with links and business partners across the world.\n\nThey carry on business using the social media of twitter. Secondly, many Nigerians, especially the jobless youth who have been rendered destitute by this thus anti-masses government.\n\nThey rely heavily on legitimate income realised from the platform through advertisement of their products and services and act on behalf of their not so ICT-compliant clients who desire to reach out to the world Banning Twitter is akin to what this government did 8n a kneel-jerk action on coming to power whether thoughtlessly banned Nigerians from operating their domiciary foreign accounts .The naira has never recovered from this shock treatment.\n\nPerhaps, more important is that the ban outrightly denies citizens of their individual and collective right to freedom of speech and right to freedom of expression and the press ,contrary to section 39 of the Constitution. The cumulative effectof these negative act is a serious blight on Nigeria\u2019s image both at home and abroad.\n\nTHE CURIOUS JUSUN STRIKE ANGLE\n\nFrom day one, I had whole-heartedly supported the JUSUN strike by Judicial workers. I had believed (and still believe) that Judicial autonomy must never be compromised.\n\nI dripped oceans of ink and made tons of television appearances (permit the hyperbole; it is to emphasise the frequency), arguing that the strike was well-intentioned because it was meant to save the Judiciary from itself, give it autonomy from the strangulating grip of State Governors; and allow it unfettered access to its constitutionally granted funds without genuflecting before \u201calmighty\u201d State Governors.\n\nThen twitter suspended Buhari\u2019s account and pulled down his offensive threats against his own electors and citizens he governs. Then, Lai Mohammed reacted by saying the FG has banned twitter operations in Nigeria. And, now, Malami has directed the DPP to prosecute any Nigerian who flaunts this ban by using VPN to bypass it.\n\nNO ACCESS TO COURT\n\nIn all these, the agitated citizens are eager to go to court (section 6 of the Constitution), to challenge these outrageous infractions of their rights.\n\nThen, they suddenly realize that the doors to the courts are firmly shut, and put under lock and key by JUSUN workers. So, they lick their oozing wounds.\n\nMeanwhile, the same courts being protected, are busy every day, delivering judgements (physical and virtual), on matters already pending before the JUSUN strike commenced.\n\nSo, who are these workers that prepare the files, take them to Judges and create the enabling environment for such sittings, including fixing the zoom meetings? How and where do they gain access to the courts\u2019 strong rooms, filing cabinets and court processes, to aid the Judges? Just how? I cannot understand. Or, can you?\n\nPLAUSIBLE CONSPIRACY THEORY\n\nMeanwhile, the Governors and the presidency appear not only comfortable with the existing impasse (which has literally suspended the third arm of Government, as during vile military juntas), they are quite happy with it. Their unyielding stance is encouraging the strike.\n\nThese got me thinking. I therefore decided to give a second look at the unfolding scenario. It points to one fact: Nigeria appears to have been scammed by some smart elite alecs, working in collaboration and tandem with probably the unsuspecting JUSUN leadership. My response to this new development?\n\nJUSUN, CALL OFF THE ONGOING STRIKE IMMEDIATELY.\n\nMY NEW STANCE\n\nI have now changed my views and stance. My new stance is now occasioned by the frequency of series of curious events (some quite frightening), emanating from the government and its operatives in the last two weeks.\n\nFirst, the Attorney-General, Malami, condemned Southern Governors\u2019 ban on open grazing by cattle. He curiously likened the murderous acts of non-tax paying nomadic cattle rearers to innocent shop-owning, spare-parts-selling Igbos who carry out their businesses legitimately and peacefully in their rented premises, paying their tax, tenement rate, water and wastage disposal bills.\n\nFreedom of movement by human beings in section 41 of the Constitution was now being mistaken for freedom of movement for cows, sheep and goats.\n\nThe life of a cow was being elevated, valued and priced beyond that of slaughtered and raped human beings. Second, there sprang out an alleged secret memo attributed to the Attorney-General (but which he has firmly denied and denounced), in which he purportedly advised President Buhari to declare a state of emergency and suspend provisions of the 1999 Constitution that deal with the people\u2019s fundamental rights. I believed his denial because that would have been unthinkable, having regard to his sacred position and duties as espoused in sections 150 and 174 of the Constitution.\n\nGOVERNMENT\u2019S APPARENT GAME PLAN\n\nLet us not continue to be used by fifth columnists as pawns in a game of musical chairs. This government will very shortly likely crack down on the opposition, rights Activists, dissenters, plural voices and perceived enemies.\n\nThere will be no courts to run to with a view to obtaining any remedy. They are all firmly locked. Many of the Justices and Judges that we are strenuously defending, denying lawyers (especially junior lawyers, the challenged and widows) food and money in their pockets, are enjoying, receiving their salaries and emoluments. We now appear to be crying more than the bereaved.\n\nThe iron is rusting while the gold is shining. The JUSUN strike has therefore outlived its usefulness and purpose.\n\nJUSUN, CALL OFF THE STRIKE NOW AND SAVE THE JUDICIARY FROM ITSELF, FROM SELF-IMMOLATION AND SELF-DESTRUCT. IMMEDIATELY. AS URGENT AS YESTERDAY.\n\nTHE LAW: NO NIGERIAN CAN BE PROSECUTED FOR A NON-EXISTENT OFFENCE\n\nThe Court of Appeal was emphatic in ONWUGHALU v. FRN (2019) LPELR-47313(CA), that no citizen of Nigeria can be tried or punished for an alleged offence not created by law. It said:\n\n\u201cTruly, our Constitution guarantees that no citizen of this country should be put through a criminal trial, convicted and punished over an alleged offence not created by any law and thus unknown to the laws of the land. See the causa celebre of AOKO V FAGBEMI (1961) 1 ALL NLR 400, which till date represents the locus classicus on this matter.\n\nIn GEORGE v. FRN (2013) LPELR-21895(SC), the apex Court held thus:\n\n\u201cAny conduct that must be sanctioned must be expressly stated in a written law to wit: an Act by the National Assembly. That is what Section 36(12) of the 1999 Constitution provides. Such conduct should not be left to conjecture. As well, it cannot be inferred by the Court\u201d.\n\nAlso, in SELE v. STATE (1993) LPELR-3030(SC), the apex court held:\n\n\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of our concept of criminality, and which is protected by our Constitution, that a person can only be charged with and convicted for an offence recognised by the law and in existence at the time the act alleged was committed \u2013 See S.33(8) of the Constitution 1979. This is the hallowed and sacred principle of legality. It is because of its importance and high public policy that the legislative jurisdiction of the legislature is also excluded from having retrospective effect in relation to any criminal offence whatsoever.\u201d Per ADOLPHUS GODWIN KARIBI-WHYTE, JSC (Pp 18 \u2013 18 Paras A \u2013 C.\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Court in TAFIDA v. FRN (2013) LPELR-21859(SC), made it clear that:\n\n\u201cthe interpretation of a penal legislation or any statute for that matter should not be left to the whims and caprices of the Judge called upon to interpret the legislation. Any conduct which carries a sanction of imprisonment must be expressly stated in a written law and not left to conjecture or inference by the Court.\u201d Per KUMAI BAYANG AKA\u2019AHS, JSC (Pp 15 \u2013 16 Paras C \u2013 D).\n\nFinally, on the legal position, the Court of Appeal in OMATSEYE v. FRN (2017) LPELR-42719(CA), incisively held that:\n\n\u201cIt is trite and settled by the 1999 Constitution (as altered) particularly Section 36(8) which states thus: \u201cNo person shall be held to be guilty of a criminal offence on account of any act or omission that did not, at the time it took place, constitute such an offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for any criminal offence heavier than the penalty in force at the time the offence was committed.\u201d\n\nThere is no question therefore on the need to have a statutory provision clearly creating an offence before any person can be convicted for the said offence. The punishment too must be specifically named in a legislation.\n\nThe apex Court emphatically stated that it is rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act which is not qualified as an offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and the punishment thereof prescribed.\n\nAll Courts, so named, cannot claim ignorance of these facts. See the following cases: GEORGE V FRN (2014) ALL FWLR (PT.718) 879; ABIDOYE V FRN (2014) ALL FWLR (PT.722) 1646; ALIYU V FRN (2014) ALL FWLR (PT.720) 1272.\u201d Per YARGATA BYENCHIT NIMPAR, JCA (Pp 7 \u2013 8 Paras A \u2013 A).\n\nAll the above judicial authorities are crystal clear that neither Malami, the DPP, nor this government, can prosecute any twitter user. Using twitter is not a known crime or written offence.\n\nThe NASS has not enacted any law banning the use of the social media, including Twitter. Mere verbal pronouncement, declaration, directives or threats by the Attorney-General, do not amount to a Law validly passed by the NASS.\n\nSOME RESPITE: A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL\n\nAll hope is not lost, even with the JUSUN strike. There is some respite here.\n\nAny Nigerian arrested or detained should immediately proceed to the sub-regional West African Court situate in Abuja.\n\nThe African charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights is there to protect the rights of citizens of Nigeria.\n\nThe Court that operates it (the West African Court) is there right now, fully operational.\n\nThe last time I checked, we are not in the Hobesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, short and brutish.operating a military Junta or Musolini and Hitler\u2019s despotism and absolutism! Nigeria is not a banana Republic.\n\nNever in the past; not yesterday, not today; not tomorrow; not ever. We operate a Constitutional democracy where things are done according to the Rule of Law and within our Constitutional organogram. We do not operate rule of the thumb or rule of men.It is always better to build strong institutions rather than strong men. My one kobo piece of advice to this clueless Government that spreads pains, agony, pangs and blood like manure on plants.\n\nOzokheme, is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Assessing Buhari\u2019s place in Nigeria\u2019s \u201cJune 12\u201d history -NigPilot",
          "text": "On June 12, this year, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country and the continent\u2019s social and economic hub, would be celebrating its \u201c Democracy Day\u201d, made possible through the magnitude of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s (PMB\u2019s) political will . The President had wisely picked \u201cJune 12\u201d above \u201cMay 29\u201d, which was observed for about two decades as \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d, by former Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s presidency and a couple administrations after his. May 29 ceased to be recognized as \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d on June 6, 2019, by the instrumentality of President Buhari\u2019s pronouncement.\n\nRetrospectively, a confetti of encomiums was showered on the President from within and outside the country for effectuating the policy decision. The global approbation was particularly much more significant. Buhari\u2019s fairness in bending backwards to ensure a post-humous recognition of the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola, as the winner of the presidential election of June 12, 1993 enjoyed global validation. The June 12, 1993 presidential contest was a watershed election, whose outcome was thought to have been permanently consigned into the dust-bin of history. Although the winner of the poll and the custodian of the people\u2019s sacred mandate was dead, and he actually died in the custody of the Federal Government in the fight to actualize his mandate, Buhari\u2019s post-humous recognition simply recreated, redefined and activated the spirit of June 12.\n\nIn Nigeria, politicians across the political divides, for the first time, abandoned partisan proclivities to hail President Buhari, for his historic decision to recognize and institutionalize June 12 by making it Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day and for conferring national honours on some protagonists of the June 12 presidential election debacle. The honours conferred on the martyrs of democracy were particularly instructive and touching. Abiola was conferred with the highest national honurs of Grand Commander of the Federal Republic, GCFR, reserved for Heads of State and Presidents.\n\nAlhaji Bashir Tofa, Abiola\u2019s opponent and presidential candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), had eulogized Buhari for the decisions. Babagana Kingibe, Abiola\u2019s running mate in the botched election also praised the president. Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president of Nigeria and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election was earnest in his comments. Read him: \u201cAs we celebrate yet another episode of the June 12 struggle, the desire for hope is more preponderant today, much as it was twenty-six years ago. So, for all true lovers of democracy, let us keep the HOPE alive\u201d\n\nFor most Nigerians and others from across the world, who once witnessed the enormity of the debacle that occasioned the annulment of the June 12, 1993 elections with its concomitant corollary, the recognition of its martyrs and those still living, certainly attracted them in their numbers to the first inauguration ceremony by President Buhari. Remarkably, some of the African heads of states who attended included: Paul Kagame of Rwanda, George Manneh Weah of Liberia, Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo Republic, Hage Geingob of Namibia, Macky Sall of Senegal, Mohammed Ould Abdel Aziz of Mauritania, Mahammadou Issoufou of Niger, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of Ghana, the late Idris Deby Itno of Chad and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Head of the African Union Commission (AUC) joined other crops of diplomats and personalities who graced the occasion\n\nTo refresh readers\u2019 memory, the late Chief Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) had emphatically secured a landslide victory against Alhaji Tofa, of the NRC, before the junta of General Ibrahim Badmasi Babangida (popularly known as IBB) suddenly annulled the electoral process. The IBB government, in the face of local and foreign angst, said on June 24, 1993 that the reason for annulling the results was vote-buying and that during the said election, the need to protect the Nigerian judiciary, which had given an order stopping the conduct of the election was certain. There was also a position by the then military leadership that an Abiola\u2019s presidency was not feasible.\n\nThe election\u2019s annulment snowballed into a protracted national crisis, leading to a long-time detention and final death of Abiola in the custody of the Federal Government. He died while his release from detention was being negotiated. Many notable Nigerians were killed in the dilatory process of actualizing the revalidation of the annulled June 12 mandate. The struggle for the actualization of the mandate and Abiola\u2019s death accentuated wild street protests by Nigerians, especially the youths.\n\nThe final change of the \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d by President Buhari on June 6, 2019 at the twilight of his first four-year tenure, also saw another post-humous recognition, where the National Stadium edifice, based in Abuja, the country\u2019s capital, was named after the late Abiola, a sports enthusiast and philanthropist extraordinaire, who was for that feat (his huge investment in Sports especially football) named the \u201cAfrican Pillar of Sports\u201d, during his life and times.\n\nIt is in the context of this recognition that President Buhari\u2019s persona as harbouring a sportsmanship spirit became exemplified. As a friend put it: \u201cBuhari possesses the spirit of sportsmanship as his second nature, as he saw in Chief Abiola a winner (and not a loser) even in death. The icing on the cake was that he went further to pay an official visit to the Abiola\u2019s family, to apologise for the wrongs done to him, by the unjust annulment and irreparable death. If politics was read to it in some quarters as vote-catching gimmick, then it was a smart political move that has earned him eternal credit for continuous validation by posterity.\u201d\n\nWhile President Buhari went about the due process of righting the wrong and healing the wounds of the past that had festered, there were and are still skeptics about the worthy course. There were refrains such as: was this not the same President Buhari, who as an army General, in 1983, toppled a democratically-elected government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari and his Deputy, Dr Alex Ekweme, with the concomitant dissolution of all other national and state elective offices and the political parties? Was it not he who encouraged, by virtue of that overthrow, the successive military regimes that lasted fifteen years until the return of party democracy in 1999?\n\nBut, when the duo of Generals Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon stepped on the stage on December 31, 1983, Nigerians jubilated and shouted good riddance to the politicians. They celebrated the overthrow of the government and the political class, which they described as inept and corrupt. General Buhari\u2019s government was largely perceived as corrective and had already defined its mission of cleansing the Augean stables of prosecuting corrupt politicians, while it was setting up a programme of returning the country to civilian rule. The IBB\u2019s junta and others who lusted to have their own taste of the military rule, had toppled Buhari/Idiagbon, and had clogged the wheel of progress towards democratic culture.\n\nNow, as the 2021 edition of the \u201cJune 12 Democracy Day\u201d celebration is just a few days away, there is justifiable sense of entitlement by the Buhari administration to being the greatest defender of democratic principles and ethos which were robustly exemplified in the beatification and canonization of \u201cJune 12\u201d (Democracy Day). Indeed, by the singular act of recognizing Abiola as the duly elected president, Buhari had settled a national question that would have dogged the politics of Nigeria eternally. And by conferring the highest national honours on Abiola, he had simply reinforced the bulwark of that fact of history. By giving legal garb to these two symbolic gestures, Buhari has created history and built a legacy in pragmatic, programmatic and progressive democratic culture of accommodation and pacification.\n\nBuhari\u2019s place in history, especially in the contemplation of the history and politics of June 12, 1993 presidential mandate, is eternally assured for posterity to continue to interrogate and validate. The celebration of the June 12 Democracy Day is, therefore, beyond symbolism (since Abiola did not really consummate his presidency, but is now being assumed to have actualized his presidential mandate by virtue of the national holiday and highest national honour of GCFR), an eternal validation of Buhari\u2019s significant place in the political history of June 12 and its reconstruction in final appeasement of elements who had hitherto been vexed, inconsolable and implacable. This is giving, therefore, on the occasion of yet another celebration, kudos to PMB and to Nigerians on the essential resurrection and approbation of the June 12 spirit through the \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d deification and the appeasement of significant stakeholders through highest National honour (GCFR) conferred on the late Chief MKO Abiola.\n\n\u2026Momodu is an Abuja-based businessman and consultant.",

          "text": "One of the wives of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state, Hajiya Asia El-Rufai, has declared that she would rather die than ransom be paid to kidnappers if she gets abducted.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday while addressing participants at a peace and security training, organized for women by Equal Access International (EAI), Mrs. El-Rufai aligned herself with the position of the governor who has consistently maintained that no ransom should be paid to bandits.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said the solution to ending kidnapping is to stop payment of ransom.\n\nShe said she was ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to the country.\n\nShe said Nigerians must get back their once peaceful country, noting that women have a great role to play in achieving that.\n\n\u201cWe must sacrifice to bring this (kidnapping) to an end. I am ready to die in the hands of kidnappers if it will bring peace to this country.\n\n\u201cFor as long as you continue to pay ransom, it is like you are adding kerosene to fire. You are giving bandits, kidnappers money for ammunition to continue to haunt you.\n\n\u201cWe should not pay ransom. This is my personal opinion. I have said it before and I will say it again, if I am kidnapped don\u2019t pay any ransom, rather pray for me that if it is death, I go in a good way and if I am going to be released that I am not violated,\u201dshe said.\n\nAccording to her, as long as the bandits are paid ransom, they will not change.\n\n\u201cCollectively as a country we have to say no, we can not continue to give them our hard earned money to buy weapons and drugs to kill and maim our children,\u201d the governor\u2019s wife said.\n\nMrs. El-Rufai said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t put a stop to this, they will destroy us all. They will even kidnap the person that takes the ransom to them.\n\n\u201cYou will see that some of them you even give the ransom and they still kill the person, so you have lost twice.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the recent communal clashes in parts of Kaduna state, the governor\u2019s wife urged women to shun divisive narratives created by selfish politicians and work for the unity of the state.\n\nIn his remarks, the Country Director of the EAI, Mr. Maaji Peters said the training was aimed at securing Nigerian communities through creation of Civilian Security (CIVSEC ) who will make contributions and decisions on issues that affects them and their communities.\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "title": "US Drops Trump Order Targeting TikTok, Plans Its Own Review",
          "text": "The White House has dropped Trump-era executive orders intended to ban the popular apps TikTok and WeChat and will conduct its own review aimed at identifying national security risks with software applications tied to China, officials said Wednesday.\n\nA new executive order directs the Commerce Department to undertake what officials describe as an \u201cevidence-based\u201d analysis of transactions involving apps that are manufactured or supplied or controlled by China. Officials are particularly concerned about apps that collect users\u2019 personal data or have connections to Chinese military or intelligence activities.\n\nIn revoking some of President Donald Trump\u2019s blanket-style orders against Chinese tech companies and replacing them with a narrower approach, the Biden administration has not actually weighed in yet on whether TikTok and other apps pose a danger to Americans.\n\nBut a senior administration official said Wednesday that the Trump actions weren\u2019t \u201calways implemented in the soundest fashion\u201d and the aim of the review is to set up clear criteria to evaluate specific data security and privacy risks for each app. He said that could lead to a range of potential future actions on an app-by-app basis.\n\n\u201cWe want to take a tailored, tough approach here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe department will also make recommendations on how to further protect Americans\u2019 genetic and personal health information, and will address the risks of certain software apps connected to China or other adversaries, according to senior administration officials.\n\nTikTok on Wednesday declined to comment. WeChat did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s attempted bans didn\u2019t hold up legally as courts blocked them, and also \u201cran up against this critique that they were mimicking China\u2019s Great Firewall,\u201d said Samm Sacks, a fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cWhat the Biden administration wants to do is maintain an open, secure internet that doesn\u2019t take a page from Beijing\u2019s playbook, while addressing legitimate risk.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s move reflects ongoing concern that Americans\u2019 personal data could be exposed by popular apps tied to China, a chief U.S. economic and political rival. The White House and Congress have both taken action to address Beijing\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe Biden administration last week expanded a Trump-era list of Chinese companies that Americans can\u2019t invest in because of purported links to the Chinese military and surveillance. Companies on the list include China\u2019s state-owned telecommunications companies, telecom equipment maker Huawei and Chinese oil company China National Offshore Oil Corp.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that aims to boost U.S. semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition.\n\nThe new executive order should lead to a framework for protecting Americans\u2019 data from China, rather than targeting specific companies, and could pressure Congress to enact a data-security law in the years ahead, said Paul Triolo, a tech policy expert at the Eurasia Group consultancy.\n\nCourts had blocked the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to ban TikTok and WeChat, which began in summer 2020, but a national-security review of TikTok by a government group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is ongoing. CFIUS had set deadlines for TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, but such a sale never happened.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in the Chinese-owned app on national security grounds. Neither Oracle or Walmart returned requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe Biden administration earlier this year had backed off President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to ban TikTok and WeChat as it reviewed national security threats posed by Chinese technology companies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has put on hold a case challenging Trump\u2019s TikTok divestment order.\n\nA cybersecurity and privacy analysis of TikTok published in March by the internet watchdog group Citizen Lab found no evidence of malicious behavior and said TikTok\u2019s data collection practices were no worse than other major social platforms such as Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that there is no overt data transmission to the Chinese government by TikTok,\u201d the report said. It added that TikTok\u2019s service did not contact any servers within China, but it was still theoretically possible that servers outside China could later transfer user data to China-based servers.",
