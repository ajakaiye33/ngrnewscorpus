          "title": "Climate protesters shut down Shell annual meeting in UK",
          "text": "Like Nigeria, several climate activists, on Tuesday, stormed an ongoing Annual General Meeting of the British Oil Company, Shell, to protest oil exploration by the company.\n\nThe protesters in their numbers gathered at Shell\u2019s venue of its Annual General Meeting in London, United Kingdom, chanting \u201cShame on Shell\u201d, and singing \u201call we are saying, stop oil and gas\u201d, and \u201cwe will stop you.\u201d\n\nAccording to the live streaming by @XRUK_Live on Twitter, Shell\u2019s AGM was put on hold as the protesters practically took over the venue.\n\nThe PUNCH reported, Monday, that civil society organisations comprising people of the Niger Delta region, environmental activists, representatives of host oil and gas communities, human rights groups, students, youths, artisans, and media practitioners, on Monday, held a rally at the office of Shell, Marina, in Lagos.\n\nThey were asking that Shell should stop oil and gas extraction in Nigeria, and urged investors to stop funding Shell\u2019s operations, owing to the environmental damage that the company\u2019s operations were allegedly causing to the water, land, and human resources in Nigeria.\n\nThey equally called for a limit of global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius pre-industrial level, and demanded, amongst others, an end to carbon emission. They equally called for a people-centered transition from fossil fuel to clean energy in Nigeria as well as the clean-up of the Ogoni land and the entire Niger Delta region.\n\nReacting to the development in the UK, the convener of Africa Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, a part of the frontal CSOs that led the yesterday\u2019s action in Lagos, Rev. David Ugolor, said, \u201cYes, we welcome the shut down of the Shell AGM and we have to end Shell impunity in Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nIn London, the Shell chairman, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, became increasingly exasperated over the protests as he asked for silence, but was forced to formally pause the meeting after 40 minutes, following the continued interruption.\n\nA shareholder was seen shouting at the protesters, saying \u201cout! out! out!\u201d while another made rude gestures toward them.\n\nIt was also gathered that the police arrived at the meeting, but watched as the protests, which lasted more than an hour, continued.\n\nClimate change has been a major issue across the world as the effects of global warming, resulting from fossil fuel combustion, pose a great danger to nature and humans, reportedly leading to flooding, wildfires, food scarcity, and communal clashes in parts of Africa.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Northern groups threaten retaliation over kinsmen killing in South-East",
          "text": "The Coalition of Northern Groups on Tuesday promised to retaliate against the alleged killing of its kinsmen in the South-East geo-political zone, the development it claimed, had been greeted with the conspiracy of silence.\n\nThe organization also threatened to boycott patronage of the media over what it termed bias by media managers on the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra and Eastern Security Network.\n\nThe Spokesperson of CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, issued the threats in a statement which, according to him, was \u201cin response to the incessant killing of Northerners in South-East\u201d.\n\nHe added that they would \u201cbe forced to react to every provocation and unwarranted violation.\u201d\n\nHe said the CNG had taken stock of events unfolding in South-East Nigeria, especially, the attacks and killings of Northerners passing through or residing among Igbo communities as minorities.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe note that hate campaigns and propaganda being conducted by created by certain interest groups in the South-East in the form of regional and ethnic agitators have emboldened the outlawed terrorist IPOB/ESN to carry out these unprovoked evictions, attacks, killings, destructions of properties and other forms of violations against northerners in various parts of the South East.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly disturbed by the reports of the brutal murder of a mother and her four children for the only sin of being Northerners. This followed other reports that some trucks conveying goods to the South were also set ablaze in Anambra at the weekend and the drivers and other occupants were killed, injured or disappeared without a trace.\n\n\u201cIn sets of gory video clips trending online and seen by CNG, the victims were seen lying in the pool of their blood with bullets spread around and a narrator speaking in Igbo saying, \u201cEverybody should look at this video that they have shot a woman and her four children. They are from the North. And they are shooting everybody they see on the street; so people should be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we also note the manifestation of a dangerous conspiracy of silence when days after the Sunday\u2019s killing of the Northerners without any provocation, the story has not been told by any of the national print and broadcast media despite wide coverage by the social media with graphic photos of the mayhem and condemnation by security operatives, groups and individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have watched and studied these events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity, to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against Nigerians collectively, and northerners in particular.\n\n\u201cThe intrinsic bias of the media and the double standards, hypocrisy and cowardice of regional, traditional, cultural, political and religious leaders from both the South and the North have become more glaring when they condemned the Deborah incident in Sokoto but conspiratorially and deliberately decline comments on the murderous activities of IPOB/ESN terrorists including the slaughter of a legislator.\n\n\u201cWe note also the deliberate attempt by the media and southern leaders to conceal the true identity of the murderous IPOB/ESN terrorists by concealing it as \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 while in actual sense they are known.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the activities of the IPOB/ESN terror groups are supported morally and politically by the vast majority of the pliant Igbo elites, politicians, traditional rulers, business persons, and the larger population of this ethnic group. It is also a situation that feeds on the docility of the affrighted section of those who pose as Northern leaders today.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks have pushed matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option, making it impossible for us to remain indifferent or silent in the face of such extreme provocations.\n\nAs the representatives of various interest groups from Northern Nigeria, the CNG today declares enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe North will no longer remain passive under such deliberate and sustained attacks on its people and interests, and will henceforth be forced to react to every provocation and unwarranted violation.\n\n\u201cThe North\u2019s reticence in speaking out or taking action is not born of fear or ignorance of how to respond in kind and those who tempt us should know that the North is no longer going to turn the other cheek.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, invite the attention of southern leaders, their Northern collaborators and the bankrupt section of the Northern political elite and other authors of mindless violence and separatism who see it as their duty to actualise what their fathers started in 1966, to remember that people from other regions are residing and doing businesses all over the North and to warn them that we shall no longer be expected to turn the other cheek if Northerners would not be protected wherever they live as minorities in particularly Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also warn media operators of an imminent boycott of patronage all over the North unless they change to being more restrained and balanced in their reporting of all situations in the country, particularly when matters coming from or affecting northerners are reported or commented on.\n\n\u201cWe caution them to desist from and to eschew the slanted reporting of events with greater bias against a particular religious and ethnic group as is witnessed in the reporting of security situations recently.\n\n\u201cWe warn that editorial policies and restraints imposed by ordinary decency and sanity must not be abandoned by the media establishment for sensational and often biased reporting that only inflame tensions in the country.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Mixed reactions trail FG\u2019s plan to impose tax on phone calls",
          "text": "Nigerians have reacted against a new Federal Government directive to impose tax on telephone calls, according to a survey conducted by a Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe Nigerian government has proposed a new tax on phone calls in its efforts to meet the needs of citizens considered to be most vulnerable to health challenges.\n\nThis comes in addition to moves by telecommunication companies to increase the cost of their services as a result of the harsh economic realities.\n\nThe telecom tax is the equivalent of a minimum of one kobo per second for phone calls to boost the funds required to finance free healthcare for the vulnerable group in Nigeria.\n\nIt is contained in the National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari recently.\n\nThe act includes a provision under Section 26, subsection 1c, which states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes telecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\n\nThe Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwo Oyedele, said, \u201cS.26 of this new law imposes a telecommunications tax of not less than 1 kobo per second on GSM calls. With call rates at about 11 kobo per second, this translates to a nine per cent tax on GSM calls.\u201d\n\nAccording to the act, the Vulnerable Group Fund is money budgeted to pay for the health insurance of vulnerable persons in a bid to subsidise the cost of provision of healthcare services to vulnerable people in the country.\n\nFor funding, the act provides several options such as basic healthcare provision fund to the authority; health insurance levy; telecommunications tax, and not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\n\nProf. Oyewale Tomori, professor of virology and former vice-chancellor of the Redeemer\u2019s University, Ede, Nigeria, said on the surface it looks good, \u201cbut this would as usual end another sweet icing on a rotten cake\u201d, as a result of poor implementation, lack of transparency and misuse of the proceeds from the taxation.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians must be taxed for talking, we must ensure that the talker benefits from putting his or her money where the mouth is.\n\n\u201cWhat have we achieved with taxation on tobacco and sugar-drenched beverages. The more we tax, the more lax our health system becomes. It is not the taxation that is the matter, but ensuring that the proceed of the tax is used for the purpose intended for,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to Tomori, \u201cthe conduit pipes of greed and wastage are already opening up to siphon and drain the proceeds from the tax into their leaking and bottomless pockets.\n\n\u201cPerhaps when next the government taxes the air we breathe, better health may be assured and insured for the ordinary citizen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Coordinator, African Health Budget Network (AHBN), Dr Aminu Magashi, said that pre-existing global health disparities magnified during the pandemic, reflect deep-rooted inequalities in income, wealth, and voice.\n\nMagashi said, therefore, that there is a need for an operational guideline to be developed on how the money would be mobilised in collaboration with the telecommunications industry and the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS).\n\nHe said that the tax would enable Nigeria to maintain essential health services to address concurrent health needs, particularly the needs and service delivery gaps targeting the most vulnerable populations.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cThere are noticeable gaps in the country, particularly concerning maternal, infant and child health, as well as prevention and treatment of other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nHe advised that a prudent and transparent mechanism should be developed to also ensure accountability and citizens participation on how the funds would be utilised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only one kobo added, that is from 11 kobo to 12 kobo per second or from 10 to 11. If it will be well utilised, it\u2019s then a small sacrifice.\n\n\u201cIf you add a kobo on calls to the amount of money people spend on data monthly, and one can sees the health services, access and benefits, then the taxation if justified,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Abigail Banji suggested that the Federal government should also consider the need for long-term investment and build upon the lessons from COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis observation brings to the fore once again, the imperative of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Up to now, the UHC effort has largely focused on ensuring that medical care is accessible and affordable.\n\n\u201cLike every laudable initiative, there is always an existent funding gap and the need for more resources to make health services more accessible and affordable to every Nigerian,\u201d she said.\n\nThe expert said that taxation on tobacco, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages is an effective but underused policy.\n\nShe suggested that such policy could be effectively deployed in funding disease prevention and health promotion, and could also help mobilise additional government revenue to fund investments and programmes that benefit the entire citizens and enhance equity.\n\nMrs Veronica Musa, a retired Principal, disagreed with government plans and alleged that the proposed plan would not get to the most vulnerable in the country.\n\nMusa advised the government to put a policy in place that would evaluate the data for well-designed programmes intended for the vulnerable, especially the elderly.\n\n\u201cThe policy will look at the age criteria for beneficiaries of social intervention programmes meant for the vulnerable and the elderly, so that government will not keep collecting from them,\u201d she advised.",
          "summary": "The Nigerian government has proposed a new tax on phone calls in its efforts to meet the needs of citizens considered to be most vulnerable to health challenges.\nThe telecom tax is the equivalent of a minimum of one kobo per second for phone calls to boost the funds required to finance free healthcare for the vulnerable group in Nigeria.\nThe Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taiwo Oyedele, said, \u201cS.26 of this new law imposes a telecommunications tax of not less than 1 kobo per second on GSM calls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only one kobo added, that is from 11 kobo to 12 kobo per second or from 10 to 11.\n\u201cLike every laudable initiative, there is always an existent funding gap and the need for more resources to make health services more accessible and affordable to every Nigerian,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The Emir of Damaturu, HRH Alhaji Dr. Shehu Hashimi, the Ibn Elkanemi the 2nd, has called on Nigerians to support the Presidential ambition of former Transportation Minister, Rt Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, a frontline aspirant in the forth-coming Presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) slated for this weekend.\n\nThe Emir made the call while receiving the Presidential aspirant at his Palace in Damaturu, the Yobe State Capital, Monday.\n\nHe said, \u201cI know much about you, I know the experience you have and the challenges you have gone through. With your track record, when you become the President, you will deliver as expected. I pray that you will be supported by Nigerians to be the President of this country.\n\n\u201cWe will support you in prayer, we will support you in all aspects that we are able to, to see that you excel. The transformation of this great country seen under the Ministry of Transportation which you were the Minister, needs to be commended. We know the role you played and we know how much you have done, The Emir said.\n\nDuring a courtesy call on the Yobe State Governor, at Government House Damaturu, Governor Mai Mala Buni said, with Amaechi\u2019s pedigree, it would only be proper for Nigerians to support him to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the country requires someone who would continue in the implementation of the lofty policies of the present administration, hence the need to support the former Transport Minister.\n\n\u201cWe need continuity and consolidation with innovation to ensure that what we are enjoying today as a nation would at least continue, because we cannot afford to start afresh, we cannot afford to risk having new hand\u2026\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, you will agree with me that most of the developed nations were developed as a result of continuity of policy and programmes, unbroken chain of leadership. In Nigeria, a two-time Director General of a Presidential campaign and one of the most trusted and active member of cabinet, who has always been there for Mr. President to kickstart everything that will move the nation forward because all the campaign promises are on his fingertips, is fit.\n\n\u201cLike I said earlier, ordinarily you shouldn\u2019t have come. You know we granted waiver to President Buhari in 2015 not to come, so we would have granted same to you, but as customary, you are here to interface with the delegates without taking the delegates for granted.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to thank you for the newly designed railway line which you took to my house. The design for the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line that goes up to Goneri, from where we turn into Damaturu, and from Damaturu to Gashua, and all the other areas you have touched. The history of the Buhari government cannot be complete without your name. We, here in Yobe appreciate you and we are always in support of you, Governor Buni said.\n\nSimilarly, at an interactive session with the party delegates, former Chief of Army Staff and Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Benin Republic, Lt. Gen. Tukur Burutai, said Amaechi should be supported because he has the courage to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cI was opportune to be the Brigade Commander in Rivers State when he served as Governor. We worked tirelessly to ensure security and he is a man of many parts. He has also shown that capacity in other areas of administration which includes the doggedness and determination to ensure that our railway work again. What we need is to give him the delegates votes for him to get that ticket and be elected as President in 2023.\n\n\u201cI am part of his team because we want to champion a cause, a very worthy cause of someone who has shown capacity, who has shown leadership, who has shown the strength in terms of leadership where he started in Rivers State as Speaker of the State House of Assembly,\u201d Buratai said.\n\nIn his address to the delegates, Amaechi assured of improved economy, where insecurity will be a thing of the past, if elected.",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Tuesday, distanced its members from the beheading of a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Okechukwu Okoye.\n\nIPOB said Okoye was beheaded by fifth columnists who are bent on destabilising its struggle in the southeast.\n\nSpokesman of IPOB, Emma Powerful, described Okoye\u2019s murder as an abomination which has nothing to do with the Eastern Security Network, ESN.\n\nA statement by Powerful reads partly: \u201cWe the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under our great leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU strongly condemn the abominable beheading of Hon. Okechukwu Okoye who was abducted a few days ago in his area. We want to also state categorically that contrary to insinuations in some quarters, the Indigenous people of Biafra IPOB could not in any way have had anything to do with this abominable act. It is imperative to state here that enemies of Biafra freedom and traitors in our region are seriously pulling all stunts to derail the freedom of our leader and the freedom of our dear Nation Biafra.\n\n\u201cAfter thorough investigations by our intelligence team, we found out that the abominable beheading of Hon Okechukwu Okoye is the system of the fifth columnists who are bent to destabilise the efforts of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB. These barbarians have been well mobilised financially and otherwise by DSS, NIA and DMI to create anarchy in our land in an attempt to derail our march to freedom.\n\n\u201cThey will commit these heinous crimes and their paymasters will use the Nigeria compromised media houses to accuse IPOB of being responsible for what we know nothing about. The question is why is IPOB being demonised unnecessarily? The simple answer is that we are fighting for the freedom of our people because we rejected their forceful take over of our land.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB intelligence unit working round the clock discovered the gimmicks and antics of Nigeria government and its security agencies, especially the Army, DSS, Police, NIA and DMI intelligence. Those pointing accusing fingers at us are the same people sponsoring the disturbing insecurity in our land. BIAFRA LAND has been infiltrated by fulani terrorists wearing Nigerian security uniforms and operating under this guise as agents of death and destruction of Biafraland.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not in the business of kidnapping or car snatching and has never been and will never be and therefore we absolutely has nothing to do with the kidnap of Okechukwu Okoye. These kidnappers, kidnapped this man on the day the Executive Governor of Anambra State, Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo visited our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in the DSS custody and every member of IPOB was very happy because he was the only Governor in the whole of Biafraland who summoned the courage to visit our leader in Abuja since his extraordinary rendition from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIPOB/ESN cannot behead our brother and dropped notes bragging that we are behind the gruesome murder. The world should take note of the similarity between the beheading of this lawmaker and the way they gruesomely murdered the two army couple last month.\n\n\u201cGovernor Chukwuma Soludo must prepare to meet these evil men humiliating and killing our people head on.\u201d",

We have a good reason for doing what we did, until our demands are met none of the victims will come out alive even if it means we all die with them. They are well taken care of as you can see from the pictures we sent to you via WhatsApp but we assure you that this will not continue.\n\n\u201cWe choose you (Tukur Mamu) to convey this important message to the government, the families of the victims and Nigerians in general because we believe you won\u2019t alter our message and we have seen you severally with Sheikh Gumi in the forest, therefore, we recognized the fearlessness in you\u201d.\n\nBarra said that it\u2019s been two months since the abduction and anything can happen to the abducted passengers henceforth.\n\nHe further explained their reasons for the abduction as a retaliation for the arrest and detention of their children by the security agencies.\n\n\u201cOur children numbering about 8 between the ages of one to seven years are currently being held at an orphanage in Jimeta, Adamawa State under the supervision of the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cThe names of our children are; Abdulrahman, Bilkisu, Usman, Ibrahim and Juwairiyyah. They were forcefully taken from our wives in Nasarawa and taken to the orphanage in Yola.\n\n\u201cFor any continued discussion on the release of these passengers and a safe resumption of the train service, our children must be released unconditionally. Only then we will release some of the abducted victims, especially the women while other passengers will be released on a prisoner exchange with some of our arrested comrades by the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pictures of the passengers they sent earlier, were among some of the pictures they sent to the negotiation team of the government as proof of the well-being of the victims. They said since then the government had been lacklustre.\n\n\u201cThey decided to come to a GSM enabled location with one of the female victims to talk to Malam Mamu and as a confirmation of their claims. Mamu said he could hear her cries with a very low voice that probably indicates exhaustion pleading with him to please talk to the government on their behalf for a swift intervention on their release.\u201d\n\nBerra threatened that, if within seven days the government does not respond to their demands, they will stop feeding the victims and will start slaughtering them one after the other and if the government doesn\u2019t respond after that, then Nigerians should forget using the Abuja-Kaduna rail line as well as the Kaduna-Abuja highway.\n\n\u201cIf the government decided not to respond, so be it. We are warning Nigerians, especially those that are patronizing the train, that if this matter is not resolved peacefully, the day they decided to attack us or do anything funny, passengers or commuters should forget to use the train or follow the Abuja-Kaduna road because we will be consistent and they can\u2019t stop us. We believe that you will deliver this message as it is.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we rely on you and urged you to convey this important message to everyone\u201d\n\nMalam Tukur Mamu replied that he understands the predicament of the government in resolving the abduction imbroglio but stated that every responsible government will look into saving innocent passengers\u2019 lives and make painful compromises where necessary even if it\u2019s against the policy of the administration.\n\nMalam Mamu then explained that prisoner exchange with known criminals on matters of national interest is a global practice and has happened in many developed countries like the United States.\n\nHe stressed the need to avoid any military action that will lead to collateral damage and the loss of innocent lives.\n\n\u201cTime is not on our side, the government must understand that they are dealing with persons with a misguided ideology and tainted religious belief. These people are not scared of death, they seem to believe that they are martyrs when they die. It will be a serious mistake to take this threat lightly. I believe an opportunity has been created for us to explore to save the lives of those innocent victims.\n\n\u201cFor me, if these innocent people will regain their freedom because of my involvement and provided that will lead to relative peace and security on our highways and rail lines I wouldn\u2019t mind if I die in the process. We must accept the fact that security alone on the Abuja-Kaduna highways remains more fragile than ever and the solution is not militarily alone, especially in a country where impending attacks can hardly be dictated and stopped.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe guidelines, the agency said, include full enforcement of corresponding sanctions against violations. The guidelines limited the cumulative amount that could be withdrawn from a local government account to not more than N500,000 daily.\n\nIt also directed that any other transaction must be done through valid cheques or electronic funds transfer, among others. It said cash withdrawal and transactions from State Joint Local Government Accounts (SJLGA) \u201cposed biggest corruption, money laundering and security threats at the grassroots and to entire financial system and the country.\u201d\n\nBut state governments had dragged the AGF, NFIU and NULGE to court arguing that such directive was in breach of financial autonomy as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.\n\nBreaking!!!

Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\nBut Justice Ekwo dismissed the suit for lacking in merit. He held that upon studying the provisions of the NFIU\u2019s guidelines, he was unable to see where the provisions thereof contradict or conflict the provision of Sections 7(1), (6) (a) and (b) of the constitution.\n\n\u201cI am also unable to see how the provisions of the 2nd defendant (NFIU)\u2019s guidelines contradict or conflict with the provisions of Section 162(6) of the constitution which creates the \u2018State Joint Local Government Account\u2019 into which allocations to the local government councils of the state from the Federation Account and from the government of the state shall be paid,\u201d he said.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe said that the guidelines did not contradict Section 162(8) of the constitution which prescribed that the amount standing to the credit of the local government council of the state shall be distributed among the local government councils of that state on such terms and in such manner as may be prescribed by the House of Assembly of the state.\n\nHe said the provisions of the 2nd defendant\u2019s guidelines do not contradict or conflict with the provisions of the 4th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution which prescribes the functions of a local government council.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Director/CEO of NFIU, Modibbo Tukur said the judgment was good as the Federal Government is always ready to protect both states and local governments by making funds available for their governance responsibility.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAccording to a statement by Chief Media Analyst, Ahmed Dikko, NFIU boss stressed that \u201cfrom this judgment and from today all transactions on local government funds will be disclosed to ICPC and EFCC 100 per cent and will be reported continuously.\u201d\n\nHe said funds could be decided on by local councils which can be channelled to improving local security.\n\nChief Executive Officer ( CEO), Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Muda Yusuf said it would enhance the capacity of the local governments to discharge their statutory responsibilities.\n\nHe said for a long time, many local governments have failed in delivering their services in managing refuse, primary education, markets and quite a number of functions allotted to them in the constitution.\n\n\u201cLocal governments have been completely subservient to the state government, with the court ruling, I think it is a good development. But the concern that we have is that even with the court ruling, it is still possible that these local governments are still subdued by their political godfathers because they could still get them to sit down and agree to continue business as usual, especially if they are in the same party.\n\n\u201cYou know the way the party structure works; party leaders determine the way it is going to be with or without court rulings, they still have a way of getting round all of these things. From what I can see, I don\u2019t think the governors are ready to let go and the local government chairmen too don\u2019t help matters.\n\n\u201cIn terms of accountability, the local governments are worse of because of the quality of people that are there. but that is not to diminish the importance of this autonomy.\u201d\n\nAlso, Daniel Dickson -Okezie, chairman, SMEs Group of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said the idea of federalism is that local governments should be autonomous, but lamented that this was not in practice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe states have always cornered the revenues, giving the local government what it wants. It will be good if things are done the right way by following the process of federalism. The level of corruption at the federal level is high, even at the state and federal levels, as a matter of fact I do not know if that of the local governments are higher.\n\n\u201cThe local government is nearer to the people, so we see much and know much about them. The local government does not seem to be doing anything. With the ruling, they might still not do anything. They won\u2019t do much. The state government controls them. The person that pays the piper detects the tune. What that means is that as long as the local is still being controlled to a great extent by the state government there might not be any change. \u201c",

The core income excluded forex gains of N45.8 billion in 2021 and N51.2 billion in 2020.\n\nProviding further breakdown of its performances in the review period, Orji said total comprehensive income declined marginally in 2021 by 8.2 per cent to close the year at N147.0 billion compared to N160.1 billion in 2020.\n\nNotwithstanding, he described the performance as a, \u201cvery solid result,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019re very pleased with the way we navigated 2021 as an authority.\u201d\n\nThe NSIA boss however noted that global inflation remained a significant disincentive to investments adding that it has continued to distort the global economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cReactions to the raging global inflation may lead to recessions in certain economies as central banks have announced varying measures of rate hikes and halt to balance sheet expansion.\n\n\u201cThe human and economic costs of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have continued to escalate resulting in heightened geopolitical tension, disruption of the global supply chain, inflation, and potential impact on food security.\u201d\n\nOrji added that: \u201cThe growth prospect in China will be undermined by its zero-tolerance stance on the emergence of COVID-19 leading to lockdown in different regions and cities.\u201d\n\nHowever, in view of the positive performances over the years, the NSIA MD said it was considering the idea of paying dividend to the shareholders of the fund including the federal and state governments. But he pointed out that the gesture was subject to the approval of the National Executive Council (NEC).\n\nOrji, said a decision would have to be made as to whether it was necessary for pay dividends now or plough back the proceeds into additional investment for greater returns, given that the NSIA returned $150 million in October 2020, to the government from the Stabilisation Fund in line with the provisions of the NSIA Act 2011.\n\nHe also hinted that the work on the Second Niger Bridge would be completed by December.\n\nAccording to him however, the single biggest risk for global capital market was complicated by the Russia- Ukraine war, as well as supply chain issues in China as it struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that, \u201cthese are all factors that create headwinds into 2022.\u201d\n\nOrji said, \u201cIn Nigeria, these global headwinds are exacerbated by challenges in the local environment. The World Bank, CBN, and Fitch have projected the Nigerian economy will grow by 2.5 per cent, 3.1 per cent, and 2.8 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the outcomes, the growth range will have minimal impact on the per-capita given the population growth rate at 2.5 per cent.\u201d\n\nOrji warned that financial performance of the NSIA in 2022 will be impacted by developments in the global and local environment given its exposure across the three funds namely the Stabilisation Fund, Future Generation Fund and Infrastructure Fund.\n\nBut he assured that the authority will take steps to strengthen the resilience of its strategy through diversification, portfolio selection, and other options to enhance the risk/ return profile and liquidity.\n\nHe said the ESG and assets transfer will be critical to the overall long-term strategy of the NSIA to expand access to third-party capital and support the global effort toward building a climate-resilient economy.\n\nOrji also said that the fund would make significant footprint in agriculture in 2022, stressing that \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to show the abilities in some areas and we\u2019re now going to roll out funding even more aggressively.\u201d\n\nHe insisted inflation remained major constraints to reasonable projections going forward.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did say, that there was just too much money pumped into the market globally and that there will be inflationary concerns. But I remember very smart economists dismissed it and said it was going to be a short-term thing; even some central bank governors, even the Federal Reserve, thought it was going to be short-term.\n\n\u201cWe did say at the time that it will not be and we say that purely as market participants who have seen what it is going to take to untangle the supply chain that has become an issue.\n\n\u201cBear in mind inflation is a big problem for investors. And when it is globalised and synchronised at the same time in the US, Europe, and across Africa, this will continue to challenge and affect returns in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that 2022 would be the toughest year of investing over the last 15 years. Since between 2008 and now this will be the toughest year for investing because navigating inflation and controlling it without triggering a recession is the biggest challenge that central bank governors all over the world have to deal with. And that is always not a good time for investment.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cSo I need you to understand that the outlook in 2022 and beyond will be affected by inflation and numbers may not be anywhere near as close to what they\u2019ve been historically. I think the world is now in a new phase of investment cycles, and we all should be prepared.\u201d\n\nHe further predicted a risk of recession in 2022 as central banks intensify efforts to curtail inflation.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge and the navigation of what many of you are already seeing across most asset prices, particularly technology companies that have been highly valued over the last 2-3-4 years and now feeling the heat as interest rates start to rise in the efforts to contain inflation,\u201d Orji said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is also something that is affecting emerging market debt. Also, this issue of rising interest rates as we curtail inflation I think will continue to affect, emerging market debt, particularly the Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cSo the first half of 2022 maybe up until the third quarter would remain challenging, but I\u2019m very optimistic that into the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, things will look a little bit better.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022How PDP delegates may vote in presidential primary\n\nThe presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is slated for this weekend in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, and the different aspirants, have been at the top of their wits, ensuring that all loose ends were neatly tidied up. However, after weeks of traveling round the country, it is beginning to get crystal clearer how the states may ultimately vote in this all-important pre-election exercise.\n\nAlthough it is public knowledge that there are 15 aspirants in all, angling to fly the opposition party\u2019s flag (after two were disqualified from the initial 17), this analysis is done with four leading presidential hopefuls in focus. They are former vice-president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki; former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi and the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike.\n\nThe chances of the four contestants indicate that while three of the four major contenders will emerge tops having made friends in all the states, the fourth, Obi, well liked across the country and may have the national spread, but that will not translate to enough votes to win him the candidacy of his party, the PDP.\n\nAlso worthy of mention is a former banker and businessman, Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, who although will garner some votes in specific states, especially in the north-east, may not make much impact. In addition, while Governor Aminu Tambuwal will readily win in Sokoto and share votes in a few other states, he will not have the national spread to win the primaries. The same goes for Governor Emmanuel Udom, who is expected to pick a single state and votes in a few others.\n\nWhile extrapolations based on the actual number of delegates might have become nearly impossible following the refusal by the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to sign the latest amendment to the Electoral Act, the current state of play, ironically, has given a more distinct picture of where the states each stand in terms of delegates voting, ultimately. Olawale Olaleye writes\n\nAbia State\n\nA Southeast state under the leadership of Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia would not mind a candidate from the southern zone, in this case Peter Obi. But with the governor recently openly declaring support for Wike, votes here would be shared between the Rivers State governor and Obi, although Wike stands a better chance with Ikpeazu. Abia is for Wike.\n\nAdamawa State\n\nGovernor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, is for Atiku and being his home state, the Adamawa delegates will naturally vote Atiku 100 per cent, both on personal recognition and the governor\u2019s influence. Adamawa Goes to Atiku\n\nAkwa Ibom State\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, is also in the race for the PDP presidential ticket and since governors are in natural control of their delegates, there\u2019s no debating where the delegates in Akwa Ibom would vote. Emmanuel Gets It\n\nAnambra State\n\nAs their governor for eight years, the period of which was believed to have accounted for their best, at least, as the narrative has remained, Anambra State would have been considered a 100 per cent deal for Obi, factoring the home zone advantage, but it is not. While he is going to have a significant edge, he is definitely sharing some of the votes with Atiku, at least, some percentage yanked off his stake. Anambra Goes to Obi\n\nBauchi State\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed of Bauch State, is also a presidential hopeful, but might have been caught between returning to office as governor and trying his luck at the presidential primary. But in the event he chooses to back any of his co-aspirants and enters into any form of negotiations, Mohammed might direct the Bauchi delegates to vote for Saraki. Until then, Bauchi is standing with its Governor.\n\nBayelsa State\n\nBayelsa is one of the fishing ponds for all the aspirants and they are all likely to battle for votes here, depending on how well they each stand. On the one hand, former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s influence is presumed could help Wike wield some influence, but his bitter relationship with former governor Seriake Dickson, on the other hand, could also work against him, since the incumbent, Diri Diouye, is Dickson\u2019s governor. Yet, Diouye too is friend to both Saraki and Tambuwal, given the National Assembly connection. Thus, Bayelsa is too close to call.\n\nBenue State\n\nAlthough Governor Samuel Ortom of the state would rather a southern president, naturally, he is a friend of Saraki and coming from North Central, there\u2019s zone advantage for the former Kwara governor. Yet, Benue would be shared between Saraki and Wike, while the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, would get some votes too, because of the Gabriel Suswam factor. Suswam is close to Emmanuel. Benue would be shared between Saraki and Wike\n\nBorno State\n\nBorno is home to Mohammed Hayatu-Deen and zone to Atiku. But Atiku does not currently boast any visible influence in the state, therefore, it is for the taking for Hayatu-Deen. But Saraki and Wike are likely to steal from the votes here, especially, because the governorship candidate in the state, Mohammed Imam, is a factor and ally of Wike. Borno will Ultimately Go Hayatu-Deen\u2019s Way\n\nCross River State\n\nCross River State is between Udom Emmanuel and Wike with some votes going for Saraki and Atiku.\n\nDelta State\n\nDespite the differences between Okowa and Ibori, the state remains for Atiku with some votes going to Saraki.\n\nEbonyi State\n\nEbonyi is definitely rooting for its own, former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim. It\u2019s a no contest zone and another waste of votes as the former senate president is unlikely to make any impact. It\u2019s in the bag for Anyim\n\nEdo State\n\nThe scenarios in Edo come in two folds. First, the case over the leadership of the party in the state is in court. However, If the choice of delegates would be based on the list with Governor Godwin Obaseki, then, the Edo votes are largely for Saraki and partly for Atiku. But If the list by Dan Orbih is the accepted one then the balance changes. Edo is disputed\n\nEkiti State\n\nEkiti State is technically in the hands of former governor Ayodele Fayose, who in turn, is loyal to Wike, the man believed to have bought him the presidential forms. Except for the likelihood that there could be some deviant delegates, who might rail against Fayose, Ekiti might have signed up for Wike 80 per cent, conservatively. Ekiti goes Wike\u2019s way\n\nEnugu State\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State is unrepentantly an advocate of southern president, but is also stuck between Wike and Obi. However, from the current reading of the equation, it is more of Wike than Obi. Enugu is also for Wike.\n\nGombe State\n\nGombe, a North East state, is standing between Wike and Hayatu-Deen and some . One, for zone advantage and the other for friendship and influence leveraging. Looks 50 percent for Atiku and the rest for Wike and Hayattu- Deen\n\nImo State\n\nImo ordinarily offers Wike and Tambuwal near-equal chances of vote-grabbing. This is because of their connections to both Emeka Ihedioha, Tambuwal\u2019s deputy as speaker of the House of Representatives and Sam Anyanwu, the party\u2019s secretary and Wike\u2019s ally. But Obi is also making inroads probably from the votes, riding on the Southeast sentiment. So, Imo is between, Wike, Tambuwal and Obi\n\nJigawa State\n\nJigawa State looks good for Saraki and Atiku, based on the current political extrapolations in the state. The state, which is in the hands of former governor Sule Lamido, ordinarily looks good for Saraki and Atiku\n\nKaduna State\n\nThe North West state is likely to play some tricks on the aspirants. While Saraki may good with votes from southern Kaduna, It\u2019s for Atiku, Wike and Hayatu-Deen\n\nKano State\n\nThe soul of Kano PDP is still in the hands of a former governor of the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who still nurses the pain of the 2015 APC presidential primaries against Atiku and co. Kano has the largest chunk of delegate votes on offer. This will be shared between Atiku and Wike\n\nKatsina State\n\nKatsina State is shared former governor of the state, Ibrahim Shema, who is with shared between Saraki and Wike with some Atiku\n\nKebbi State\n\nKebbi is Tambuwal and Atiku\n\nKogi State\n\nAlthough Kogi State shared by Saraki and Atiku\n\nKwara State\n\nKwara is not in contention. Home-zone advantage for Saraki is 100 per cent. It\u2019s a no contest state, its for Saraki\n\nLagos State\n\nLagos State is going to provide the four a good time to battle, however, with Saraki getting the upper hand up to 50 per cent, while Atiku, Wike Obi share the rest.\n\nNasarawa State\n\nNasarawa State is totally committed to Saraki and Atiku\n\nNiger State\n\nNiger State will be shared between Saraki and Atiku\n\nOgun State\n\nOgun State is doing a tripartite deal with Saraki, Atiku and Wike. So Ogun will be shared between Saraki, Atiku and Wike\n\nOndo State\n\nOndo is giving a sizeable number of its votes to Saraki. The state is sympathetic to him because his mum hails from Owo. Saraki will get the bulk of the votes while Atiku and Wike will also get share\n\nOsun State\n\nIn Osun, Saraki has an amazing relationship with the PDP candidate in the state, Ademola Adeleke, who has the delegates in his pockets. Osun is shared between Saraki and Atiku\n\nOyo State\n\nOyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, is though for a southern president, he is also a friend of Wike and sometimes, defers to him. But he also has sentiments for Saraki. Thus, while Oyo may vote Wike considerably, Saraki stands to share some parts of the votes, although paltry. Goes to Wike\n\nPlateau State\n\nPlateau, a North Central state, is playing host to Saraki, Atiku both will share the votes\n\nRivers State\n\nRivers is one hundred per cent for the owner of the state. Wike will take his state, even though it would not change the overall result. Goes to Wike\n\nSokoto State\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, is a presidential hopeful and will definitely take his state. Sokoto is, however, marked a waste of votes as Tambuwal is believed not to stand any chance in the race.\n\nTaraba State\n\nTaraba, a North East state, has always been in the bag for Atiku but that has changed with the current state of play. Atiku mainly with some votes to others\n\nYobe State\n\nYobe State is waiting to share its votes between Atiku and Hayatu-Deen. This is likely to turn out a 50/50 run for Atiku and Hayatu-Deen\n\nZamfara State\n\nZamfara delegates are going to vote for Tambuwal and Atiku.\n\nFederal Capital Territory\n\nDelegates in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will be shared by Atiku, Saraki, Wike and Obi\n\nIn the final analysis, the PDP primary appears an interesting one that is likely to defy some bookmarking.\n\nIt\u2019s a four horse race given, however given that Hayatu-Deen is new in the race, he may not make much impact. But at the end of it all, it\u2019s a matter of cash because delegates are poor need cash. But when all delegates get cash from all the aspirants, the power of cash is neutralised. Other factors, such as sentiments and conscience may play a role to swing the votes. However, for PDP, it\u2019s too close to call as at today, May 24, 2022.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says \u2018we are never on the losing side\n\n\u2022Inaugurates state governorship campaign council\n\n\u2022Urges INEC to be fair\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\n\n\nWith 26 days to the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State, National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has vowed to ensure that his party emerges victorious in the poll, which he called his first litmus test. Adamu stated this yesterday in Abuja at the inauguration of the Ekiti State Gubernatorial Campaign Council.\n\nThe APC national chairman appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be impartial during the election.\n\nAdamu stated, \u201cWith this inauguration today, we are giving a marching order to the campaign council and our great people of Ekiti State on the platform of our great party, the APC.\n\n\u201cEkiti is the first election that we will be having in this dispensation of APC. God has blessed our lives; God has blessed my life and my political career. Once there\u2019s a contest, there will be a winner and a loser; we are never on the losing side.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t take that for granted. We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that we deliver our gubernatorial candidate as the next governor of Ekiti State.\u201d\n\nThe chairman stressed that President Muhammadu Buhari was on his way out of the presidential villa, saying the president has stated clearly that he seeks no extension.\n\nAdamu stated, \u201cThe Nigerian constitution has given him two terms of four years each. He has started his second term and at the end of it, he doesn\u2019t intend to and doesn\u2019t ask for anybody to ask for a third term or any elongation of tenure.\n\n\u201cRecently, he made the same pronouncement sometime earlier this year. So we are on a bond like him to see that he has soft landing and that is to deliver this party to victory and Ekiti State is the first test.\n\n\u201cSo he takes this election very seriously. We will try to do as much as possible, we will be guided by the rules of engagement for elections. We will observe every rule, every guideline and we do hope that those who will be responsible for overseeing the compliance will be fair arbiters, will be fair referees, will be fair umpires.\u201d\n\nNational Organising Secretary of APC, Sulaiman Argungu, said with the inauguration of the committee, the party had commenced the last-mile journey to retaining the government of Ekiti State. Argungu recalled that the party conducted a rancour-free governorship primary election, where Mr. Biodun Oyebanji emerged as the party\u2019s candidate without any of the aspirants sustaining any sort of action against his triumph at any court of law.\n\nArgungu said that was indicative of the cherished democratic ethos of APC and suggestive of its determination to go into the Ekiti State governorship election and any other elections with a united front that would ensure victory at the poll.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn addition to our party\u2019s commitment to respecting constitutionally defined internal processes in our primary elections, we are also determined, and have, indeed, triggered a deliberate policy of mainstreaming the inclusion of our women and youth membership in whatever democratic undertakings we are to embark upon as a party.\u201d\n\nArgungu noted that the inclusion policy was exemplified in the composition of the Ekiti State governorship campaign council. He said apart from the general membership of the council, six more women had been added to specially represent the women\u2019s wing.\n\nHe said the party also added more youths to the campaign council as a reflection of its philosophy of accomplishing the party\u2019s objectives through the contributions and energies of all identifiable stakeholders within the party.\n\nArgungu said, \u201cOur confidence is further reinforced by the legacy of service and delivery of quality projects the outgoing governor of Ekiti State has imprinted on the process and environment of governance in the state.\n\n\u201cWe know that the good people of Ekiti State will pay back the impressive accomplishments of Dr. Kayode Fayemi by voting massively for APC so as to continue enjoying the dividends of democracy being facilitated by the ruling APC in the state.\u201d\n\nChairman of the campaign council and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, however, expressed concern that some members of the council did not appreciate the importance attached to the assignment.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cThis assignment should be acknowledged by all party members because we are only important when we are in power.\u201d\n\nHe said when members \u201ctake the election elsewhere as unimportant or serving the party outside our normal abode as unimportant, then we are dooming the party.\u201d\n\nBagudu assured the APC national chairman of excellent service by the campaign council, and victory in the end.\n\n\u201cYou have said it already that this is the first under your able leadership and because it is a first, it will form a memory of what happened in the last four years, because four years ago, we also had gubernatorial election in Ekiti State and I was privileged and honored to serve as chairman,\u201d the Kebbi State governor said.\n\nBagudu said going into the election would be easier for APC considering Fayemi\u2019s achievements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says NAF has justified govt\u2019s investment in last seven years\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has charged the military and security agencies to ensure a secure and prosperous Nigeria as the nation prepares for the general election in 2023.\n\nSpeaking in Kano Monday at a ceremonial parade to commemorate the 58th Anniversary of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), the president tasked the security agencies to remain committed, steadfast and resolute as government forges ahead to achieving a secure, peaceful and more prosperous Nigeria.\n\nWhile praising the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Staff, the Service Chiefs, as well as the leadership of the security agencies for doing their jobs well, President Buhari particularly lauded the Chief of the Air Staff, officers, airmen, airwomen and civilian staff of the air force for the good work they are doing to support government\u2019s defence and security policies as well as the high level of discipline, loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and support of democratic values.\n\nThe president also had kind words for the Nigerian Air Force for living up to its constitutional responsibilities of securing the nation, and in the process, justifying the investments of the government of the day in the force.\n\nAccording to him, the Air Force had transformed into a formidable entity, ready to confront immediate and future challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt gives me great pleasure to be here to felicitate with you on the Nigerian Air Force 58th Anniversary Celebration. This is particularly because the Nigerian Air Force has over these 58 years transformed to a formidable and resilient air force that is positioned to effectively tackle both contemporary and future security challenges.\n\n\u201cThis adaptability has thus enabled the Service to respond effectively to our dynamic national security challenges. The Nigerian Air Force has been able to meet its constitutional responsibilities thereby justifying the government\u2019s enormous support in the last seven years. I, therefore, congratulate the Chief of the Air Staff, officers and airmen/airwomen as well as civilian staff of the Nigerian Air Force on this occasion of the 58th Anniversary.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that on assumption of office in 2015, he promised to equip and re-professionalize our armed forces to perform their constitutional responsibilities more effectively, adding that: \u201cWe have therefore demonstrated the required political will and leadership, as well as committed resources towards capacity building and re-professionalizing of the armed forces.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday, I can say confidentially that the armed forces have indeed witnessed tremendous improvement in the past seven years. In particular, the provision of modern equipment and personnel motivation through enhanced welfare are also ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the provision of modern equipment and personnel motivation like the Super Tucanos and the Augusta helicopter gunships, among others, had greatly helped turn the tide in the fight against terrorists and other non-state actors, and sustained the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nHe assured the Air Force that the administration will continue to provide more platforms such as the Beechcraft, some modern helicopter gunships and UAV for it to enable it to man Nigeria\u2019s airspace more effectively.\n\n\u201cBe rest assured that as a government, we are willing to do even more to ensure the provision of the requisite support and encouragement to overcome various security challenges,\u201d he further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Suspected killers of Anambra State lawmaker, Hon. Okechukwu Okoye, have reportedly threatened to kill more lawmakers.\n\nThe threat comes less than 24 hours after the gruesome murder of the lawmaker who represented Aguata II State constituency, whose head was found on Saturday at Nnobi, in Idemili South Council Area of the state.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Okoye was abducted along with his driver in Aguata on May 15, 2022.\n\nHe was later beheaded.\n\nA report by Daily Trust said a resident of Nnobi told the newspaper that a note was dropped beside the head of the lawmaker, which was left by the roadside.\n\nIt quoted the resident as saying, \u201cIn the note, the killers vowed that more heads would roll.

But first, the opposition party must conduct seamless, rancour-free primaries and produce formidable candidates to fly its flag in the 31 states where the governorship elections will be held in 2023.\n\nWith the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms now over, the PDP has scheduled May 25 for governorship primaries.\n\nAhead of the eagerly anticipated exercise, TheCable highlights the contenders in four of the battleground states \u2014 Kaduna, Abia, Akwa Ibom and Enugu.\n\nAKWA IBOM\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkwa Ibom will witness one of the most heated PDP governorship primaries on Wednesday. Two leading contestants \u2014 Bassey Albert and Onofiok Luke \u2014 will contend with Umoh Eno, Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s anointed candidate for the race.\n\nEarlier this year, a picture surfaced online, showing Eno, the state\u2019s commissioner of land and water resources, kneeling before the governor in a display of loyalty, stirring controversy among party members in the state.\n\nAlbert, senator representing Akwa Ibom north-east and a former commissioner of finance, is widely regarded as the strongest contender in the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Ephraim Inyangeyen, Emmanuel\u2019s former chief of staff, had said there was an agreement in the party for the governor to hand over power to Albert in 2023 \u2014 an allegation Emmanuel denied.\n\nOn the other hand, Luke, the legislator representing Etinan/Nsit Ibom/Nsit Ubium federal constituency and former speaker of Akwa Ibom house of assembly, has promised to \u201cbuild our people\u201d if elected governor.\n\nSpeaking when he declared his governorship bid, Luke said \u201cwe have built roads and the infrastructure built has opened up our dear state and brought opportunities. It is now time to build our people\u201d.\n\nOther PDP governorship hopefuls are Akan Okon, a former commissioner for economic development; James Iniama, a renowned estate surveyor; and David Okpon, a businessman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP in the state is conducting its primaries despite a court injunction stopping the election.\n\nSome party members said to be loyal to Albert, had filed a suit in a federal high court in Abuja, challenging the result of the PDP ad-hoc delegates election held on April 30.\n\nAccording to the applicants, there were no ward congresses in the state and the delegates\u2019 list is a \u201cfraught\u201d.\n\nThe PDP, however, filed an appeal, praying the court of appeal to vacate the order but the matter has yet to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKADUNA\n\nFour top contenders in Kaduna are blitzing to emerge as the governorship candidate of the PDP to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe four major hopefuls are Mukhtar Yero, former governor of the state; Isa Mohammed Ashiru, 2019 governorship candidate of PDP; Shehu Sani, ex-senator representing Kaduna central; and Sani Abbas.\n\nYero was Kaduna\u2019s commissioner of finance between 2007 and 2010. He became deputy governor to Patrick Ibrahim Yakowa and later governor in 2012 after Yakowa died in a helicopter crash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYero and Ashiru are regarded as loyal members who have stuck with the PDP and are said to be major funders of the party in the state.\n\nIf loyalty is a factor in the contest, the other candidates have an edge over Sani, who recently joined the PDP from the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP).\n\nOther hopefuls in the race are Muhammad Sani Sidi, Haruna Sa\u2019id and Sadik Baba Ahmed.\n\nABIA\n\nThe PDP in Abia is heading into its governorship primary with a split house, and according to political watchers, this could affect the party in the 2023 gubernatorial race.\n\nThree major issues \u2014 zoning, Governor Okezie lkpeazu\u2019s decision to anoint Uche Ikonne as his successor, and the controversial delegates\u2019 lists \u2014 might work against the party if not resolved.\n\nLast week, Enyinnaya Abaribe, the senate minority leader, and 10 other governorship hopefuls issued a statement rejecting the delegates\u2019 list submitted to the party headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe hopefuls said no ward congress was held in the state to elect the three-man ad-hoc delegates, hence the list was manipulated.\n\n\u201cAt the centre of the vexed issues is the obvious manipulation by a tiny segment of the state executive committee of the party to yield to plots at subverting the democratic process, which is geared towards achieving a predetermined goal of imposition at all levels,\u201d the governorship hopefuls had said.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore here in our party\u2019s Abuja national headquarters to alert the party and the Nigerian public of this ugly development, which if not stopped could spell doom for the party ahead of the 2023 general election not only in Abia state but in the south-east as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned issues aside, the Abia governorship primary is expected to be fiercely contested.\n\nThe major contenders in the race are Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader; Ude Oko Chukwu, Abia deputy governor, and Emma Nwaka, former Abia state PDP chairman.\n\nOthers are Chima Anyaso, Ncheta Omerekpe, Samson Orji, and Enyinnaya Nwafor.\n\nENUGU\n\nNo fewer than 10 hopefuls are in the race to clinch the PDP governorship ticket in Enugu state.\n\nSpeculations are rife that Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu, has anointed a candidate but has yet to make it official.\n\nThe uncertainty further heightened when Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president, entered the governorship race.\n\nThere is a debate in the south-east state about orbiting the governorship ticket to Enugu east after the tenure of Ugwuanyi, who is from Enugu north.\n\nBut Ekweremadu, who has been in the senate since 2003, described the zoning arrangement as a \u201ctreachery of politics\u201d, adding that there is no such arrangement in the state.\n\nIn March, amid the zoning debate, some traditional rulers endorsed the lawmaker\u2019s governorship bid.\n\nAs the PDP braces to conduct its primaries on Wednesday, Enugu will be interesting to watch as party members insist on the zoning arrangement in the state.\n\nChijioke Edeoga, Bart Nnaji, Gil Nnaji, Everest Nnaji, Offor Chukwuegbo and Hillary Edeoga and Peter Mbah are some of the other hopefuls in the race.\n\nINCUMBENTS SEEKING RE-ELECTION\n\nMeanwhile, the governorship primaries in Bauchi, Adamawa and Oyo will be interesting to watch as Bala Mohammed, Ahmadu Fintiri and Seyi Makinde are seeking re-election.\n\nAlthough Mohammed is one of the hopefuls seeking to win the PDP presidential ticket, he was said to have secretly bought the party\u2019s governorship nomination form and was screened to contest.",

Two leading contestants \u2014 Bassey Albert and Onofiok Luke \u2014 will contend with Umoh Eno, Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s anointed candidate for the race.\n\nEarlier this year, a picture surfaced online, showing Eno, the state\u2019s commissioner of land and water resources, kneeling before the governor in a display of loyalty, stirring controversy among party members in the state.\n\nAlbert, senator representing Akwa Ibom north-east and a former commissioner of finance, is widely regarded as the strongest contender in the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Ephraim Inyangeyen, Emmanuel\u2019s former chief of staff, had said there was an agreement in the party for the governor to hand over power to Albert in 2023 \u2014 an allegation Emmanuel denied.\n\nOn the other hand, Luke, the legislator representing Etinan/Nsit Ibom/Nsit Ubium federal constituency and former speaker of Akwa Ibom house of assembly, has promised to \u201cbuild our people\u201d if elected governor.\n\nSpeaking when he declared his governorship bid, Luke said \u201cwe have built roads and the infrastructure built has opened up our dear state and brought opportunities. It is now time to build our people\u201d.\n\nOther PDP governorship hopefuls are Akan Okon, a former commissioner for economic development; James Iniama, a renowned estate surveyor; and David Okpon, a businessman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP in the state is conducting its primaries despite a court injunction stopping the election.\n\nSome party members said to be loyal to Albert, had filed a suit in a federal high court in Abuja, challenging the result of the PDP ad-hoc delegates election held on April 30.\n\nAccording to the applicants, there were no ward congresses in the state and the delegates\u2019 list is a \u201cfraught\u201d.\n\nThe PDP, however, filed an appeal, praying the court of appeal to vacate the order but the matter has yet to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKADUNA\n\nFour top contenders in Kaduna are blitzing to emerge as the governorship candidate of the PDP to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe four major hopefuls are Mukhtar Yero, former governor of the state; Isa Mohammed Ashiru, 2019 governorship candidate of PDP; Shehu Sani, ex-senator representing Kaduna central; and Sani Abbas.\n\nYero was Kaduna\u2019s commissioner of finance between 2007 and 2010. He became deputy governor to Patrick Ibrahim Yakowa and later governor in 2012 after Yakowa died in a helicopter crash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYero and Ashiru are regarded as loyal members who have stuck with the PDP and are said to be major funders of the party in the state.\n\nIf loyalty is a factor in the contest, the other candidates have an edge over Sani, who recently joined the PDP from the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP).\n\nOther hopefuls in the race are Muhammad Sani Sidi, Haruna Sa\u2019id and Sadik Baba Ahmed.\n\nABIA\n\nThe PDP in Abia is heading into its governorship primary with a split house, and according to political watchers, this could affect the party in the 2023 gubernatorial race.\n\nThree major issues \u2014 zoning, Governor Okezie lkpeazu\u2019s decision to anoint Uche Ikonne as his successor, and the controversial delegates\u2019 lists \u2014 might work against the party if not resolved.\n\nLast week, Enyinnaya Abaribe, the senate minority leader, and 10 other governorship hopefuls issued a statement rejecting the delegates\u2019 list submitted to the party headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe hopefuls said no ward congress was held in the state to elect the three-man ad-hoc delegates, hence the list was manipulated.\n\n\u201cAt the centre of the vexed issues is the obvious manipulation by a tiny segment of the state executive committee of the party to yield to plots at subverting the democratic process, which is geared towards achieving a predetermined goal of imposition at all levels,\u201d the governorship hopefuls had said.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore here in our party\u2019s Abuja national headquarters to alert the party and the Nigerian public of this ugly development, which if not stopped could spell doom for the party ahead of the 2023 general election not only in Abia state but in the south-east as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned issues aside, the Abia governorship primary is expected to be fiercely contested.\n\nThe major contenders in the race are Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader; Ude Oko Chukwu, Abia deputy governor, and Emma Nwaka, former Abia state PDP chairman.\n\nOthers are Chima Anyaso, Ncheta Omerekpe, Samson Orji, and Enyinnaya Nwafor.\n\nENUGU\n\nNo fewer than 10 hopefuls are in the race to clinch the PDP governorship ticket in Enugu state.\n\nSpeculations are rife that Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu, has anointed a candidate but has yet to make it official.\n\nThe uncertainty further heightened when Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president, entered the governorship race.\n\nThere is a debate in the south-east state about orbiting the governorship ticket to Enugu east after the tenure of Ugwuanyi, who is from Enugu north.\n\nBut Ekweremadu, who has been in the senate since 2003, described the zoning arrangement as a \u201ctreachery of politics\u201d, adding that there is no such arrangement in the state.\n\nIn March, amid the zoning debate, some traditional rulers endorsed the lawmaker\u2019s governorship bid.\n\nAs the PDP braces to conduct its primaries on Wednesday, Enugu will be interesting to watch as party members insist on the zoning arrangement in the state.\n\nChijioke Edeoga, Bart Nnaji, Gil Nnaji, Everest Nnaji, Offor Chukwuegbo and Hillary Edeoga and Peter Mbah are some of the other hopefuls in the race.\n\nINCUMBENTS SEEKING RE-ELECTION\n\nMeanwhile, the governorship primaries in Bauchi, Adamawa and Oyo will be interesting to watch as Bala Mohammed, Ahmadu Fintiri and Seyi Makinde are seeking re-election.\n\nAlthough Mohammed is one of the hopefuls seeking to win the PDP presidential ticket, he was said to have secretly bought the party\u2019s governorship nomination form and was screened to contest.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can proptech solve Nigeria\u2019s urbanisation crisis?",
          "text": "\u201cNearly 75% of Nigerians living in major cities are tenants, and that says a lot about the need for houses,\u201d begins Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, who is moderating a Live session on property technology\u2014proptech\u2014in Nigeria. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing concern, especially as Nigeria is growing at the rate of 2.5% per annum. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is: where will these people live, and can they afford it?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the United Nations projected that Nigeria\u2019s population will double by 2050; that\u2019s over 400 million people living in Africa\u2019s 14th-largest country by land mass.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Nigeria doesn\u2019t have the land mass to accommodate these people; it is the second-largest West African country with 923,768 km2 (356,669 sq mi) surface area. The problem is that 51.96% of Nigeria\u2019s population\u2014the seventh-largest population globally\u2014is situated in densely-populated urban areas while the rest are scattered across rural communities. At the current growth rate of about 2.8%\u20133% a year, Nigeria\u2019s urban population is expected to double in the next 2 decades.\n\nUrbanisation, especially one as rapid as Nigeria\u2019s, comes with challenges, most notably the insufficiency of basic infrastructures. Some studies suggest that rapid urbanisation has caused most cities in Nigeria to undergo urban decay because of a lack of or breakdown in basic services, potable water supply, electricity, efficient city transport services, affordable housing, and waste disposal systems.\n\nAll these challenges have made house-hunting in urban areas a living hell, with searchers reporting problems like extortive rent prices, high agency inspection fees, duplicity of sales, and misrepresentation. In fact, between December 2020 and April 2021, Nairametrics estimates that rent across urban areas like Lagos and its environs increased by 30%.\n\nIn solving this problem, many have turned to tech. If tech can push financial inclusion in Nigeria from 21.6% in 2010 to 64.1% in 2020, then surely it can do the same for housing.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s proptech industry raising $2 million in investments in 2021 alone, TechCabal sought to answer these questions in a Live session. On May 6, 3 startup founders\u2014Naomi Olaghere, co-founder and VP/Operations, RentSmallSmall; Kanyinsade Ademuson, founder, CEO and Principal Architect of Seventh Space; and Dapo Eludire, COO of PropertyPro.ng\u2014sat with TechCabal Senior Reporter Daniel Adeyemi to discuss the prospects of proptech in Nigeria.\n\nIn small small instalments\n\nNaomi Olaghere kicks off the session by explaining what her startup, RentSmallSmall\u2014a Lagos-based on-demand service offering instalment rent payment options\u2014is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset thing,\u201d Olaghere says. \u201cPeople often think they have to have all their money together before they can buy something or even rent a house, but RentSmallSmall is changing that. We\u2019ve been in existence for 3 years now, and we\u2019re letting people know that they can pay their rent like monthly, quarterly, monthly, or annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how does that benefit the landlord,\u201d Adeyemi asks. In Nigeria, annual rent is a practice vigorously upheld by most landlords with some requiring 2 years\u2019 advance from new tenants.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was a herculean task to get landlords to agree to collect monthly rent,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cIt\u2019s still an uphill battle, but we\u2019ve been able to show them the benefits of RentSmallSmall. For example, we can assure landlords that defaulting tenants will be out within a week because of our licensing agreements with the tenants. We\u2019re also very concerned with long-term preservation of assets, and that helps us build trust with landlords.\u201d\n\nDesign for your users\n\nAt Seventh Space, Kanyinsade Ademuson and his team believe in developing houses for the average upwardly-mobile Nigerian.\n\n\u201cLast year, I was in the market for an apartment for 6 months, and I have to tell you, I\u2019ve seen houses,\u201d Daniel Adeyemi exclaims. \u201cSome \u2018affordable\u2019 houses with 2 feet kitchens, and some houses overpriced because of POP ceilings. What kind of solutions are there for affordable and habitable housing?\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes the answer is simple: \u201cStop developing houses that your target market can\u2019t afford.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the property trends today, builders are developing for people who genuinely can\u2019t afford them. However, I think that one of the major solutions we can provide is actually getting designs that are centred around average Nigerians who are genuinely poor.\u201d\n\nThe way to do that, Ademuson says, is by taking advantage of underutilised properties and increasing the speed of production. \u201cThere are a lot of lands that are owned but unused. Part of the solution is to create policies that ensure the usage of underutilised lands. We also have to consider our environment, and build for the environment we are in. We need to look at different technologies or building technology methods, using different materials and materials that we can research and create here, within Nigeria, and which are suitable for our environment.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ademuson says, the next step is to produce quickly and in large quantities. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to produce more, and this means factory-assembled production or linear production that caters to the needs of people while driving the prices of houses down.\u201d\n\nNo space for data or trust\n\nFor Dapo Eludire whose startup, PropertyPro.ng, is one of Nigeria\u2019s leading real-estate search platforms, the solution lies in finding and housing data.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have centralised data,\u201d Eludire laments. \u201cThe data we have is collated by individuals, not by the government so you can\u2019t depend on it. We don\u2019t know the market trends or its movements, and so we are forced to move blindly.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust is the next step, as Eludire believes. \u201cLiquidity in the real estate sector is not enough, so everyone is careful of whom they buy from. A lot of scrutiny goes into deals, and this elongates timelines. But building trust will allow deals to flow accordingly so everyone can manage their time well.\u201d\n\nCollaboration breeds growth\n\nProptech deals across Africa are gradually growing, projected to increase by 6.4% between 2019 and 2024. All 3 founders agree that a large contributor to the growth is collaboration.\n\n\u201cProptech has sub-sectors,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cThere\u2019s the financial part, the construction segment, the user segment etc. And a lot of proptech companies have begun to understand the importance of collaborating with stakeholders in the different sectors. This is what has helped with growth and development.\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes that most of the growth has been on the service or software end at the expense of the hardware end which has been left out. \u201cWe\u2019re lagging on the production end of things, and we need to figure out how to build better and faster for our end users.\u201d\n\nBuilding ahead\n\nIn search of better growth, Eludire believes that the next step in proptech development is for the private financing sector to provide more liquidity for users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always an expensive venture whenever you\u2019re buying or renting a property. People use over 40% of their annual earnings for rent alone. We have to create and enable more liquidity in Nigeria, just like what Naomi and RentSmallSmall is doing. Because of solutions like that, more Nigerians are able to afford housing.\u201d\n\nEludire also calls on the government to enforce licensing of trained real estate agents. \u201cEverybody is a real estate agent in Nigeria, and most are untrained. There are no rules, no guidelines or etiquette that they learn; they\u2019re all just there for the commission. We don\u2019t even know how many agents we have because everyone is in it, and that\u2019s why agents misbehave, extort renters, and misrepresent property owners.\u201d\n\nNigeria has no federal law mandating the registration of real estate agents, but it does it have state laws or policies regulating their activities like the Lagos State Property Protection Law of 2016. However, none of these laws mandates registration for agents, so there is no recourse for tracking the activities of wayward agents.\n\nSolving this problem, as Eludire explains, will help ease renters\u2019 experiences in the sector.\n\nIn closing, Olaghere reiterates the importance of collaboration between the government, the proptech sector, and more importantly, the end users.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share to your network on WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How companies can shape the narrative for tech-enabled mobility in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Nigerian mobility companies were high-flying. Moving around major cities like Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, or travelling between different cities became so easy with the tap of a few buttons on the smartphone.\n\nIn the period in question, companies like GIG Mobility, Max.ng, Gokada, and OPay\u2019s ORide took the mobility space by storm, and soon after Pan-African players like Safeboda came into the mix. Before the infamous Lagos Okada ban, venture capital funding in Nigeria seemingly showed a healthy appetite for the new kids on the block.\n\nSince then, funding for mobility companies ($147m in 2021) have largely gone to companies on the vanguard of innovation and sustainability in Africa\u2019s mobility space.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s mobility companies have witnessed varying fortunes, there are important factors that are currently not being addressed in the sector. Cracks that are currently being papered over with technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent developments suggest that this might be about to change.\n\nLed by mobility giant, GIG Mobility, major players in Africa\u2019s mobility space are gearing up to have important conversations at the first ever Africa Mobility Conference taking place on June 2, 2021 with theme: Pathways to the future of mobility in Africa.\n\n\u201cJust stepping into the mobility space, I realised the players in the space are not trying to shape the narrative,\u201d says Enahoro Okhae, newly appointed CEO of GIG mobility. \u201cWe need to have several important discourses across different spheres for the industry to be stabilised.\u201d\n\nTaking a glance across the globe, you\u2019d realise that Okhae\u2019s assertion holds true. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla, have mastered storytelling to shape the narrative around their industry.\n\nWhat to solve in Africa\u2019s mobility sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you read our 2020 article on the deep challenges of mobility and logistics in Nigeria, by now you should realise that the challenges run even deeper. No matter what wind blows in the universe, people will always need to move.\n\nHowever, Okhae points out that several people are still not aware of the impact that insecurity is having on people traveling in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen you see physical evidence of insecurity in our roads, you\u2019re only seeing it after hundreds of issues have been dealt with. If 1 person is flying, maybe another 1000 is travelling by road.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, the tabloids have been filled with news of insecurity in Nigerian roads. For context, look no further than the hijacking of the Abuja-Kaduna train by armed gunmen, which led to the loss of lives and property. With such chilling stories flying around, some Nigerians have preferred flight over road trips, but given the cost of plane tickets, only a minute percentage of Nigerians have that luxury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), transportation contributes up to 3% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. When you consider that Road transportation accounts for 90% of this GDP contribution, Okhae\u2019s argument really shines through. While Water and Rail transport show decent numbers, the NBS describes Air transport\u2019s contribution as negligible.\n\n\u201cWe need to have very necessary conversations about the issue of insecurity and present these findings to the relevant policy makers in government to have the necessary change.\u201d\n\nWith the heavy reliance on road transport for travel and logistics, Okhae also highlights the impact it would have on our environment.\n\n\u201cWe live in a society where people don\u2019t really care about stuff like sustainability. As a company actively playing in the mobility sector, we need to saddle ourselves with the responsibility of having such conversations early enough.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okhae, the vehicles going out everyday negatively affect the environment, and we need to start taking alternatives like electric vehicles very seriously.\n\nA 2018 World Bank study reveals that air pollution cost Lagos, Africa\u2019s largest city, up to $2.1 billion and 11,200 premature deaths. Road transportation, the report says, was the primary source of air pollution.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve seen innovations in the clean tech space with the likes of Jet Motor company for electric vans, then Max mobility, and Siltech for electric scooters and bikes.\n\n\u201cRather than buy diesel for several vehicles, I\u2019d rather buy just one generator and use that to charge several vehicles before going on a trip,\u201d Okhae adds.\n\nHow to innovate for mobility in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICU monitoring hub\n\nIn other parts of the world, mobility is witnessing defining moments with technology in the mobility sector, but Africa is seemingly being left behind.\n\nJude Odum, COO of GIGM reveals that the rest of the world are making advances with self-driving vehicles and other mouth watering features and Africa needs to get there sooner than later.\n\n\u201cBefore we even start talking of those, we need to overcome the systemic barriers like security and the local economy itself. 4 years ago, we could spend $16,000 to bring in a brand new Toyota Hiace bus into the country. Today, you spend almost three to four times that amount to bring in the same vehicle.\u201d\n\nSadly, Odum reveals that due to the current economic terrain, mobility operators have not been able to increase prices commensurate with the overall market conditions.\n\nAt the mobility conference, Odum hopes the conversation goes beyond just the regular road, rail and air transport.\n\n\u201cCould we have something else that could help mobility in Africa given our current challenges? How is the government developing policies that will create an enabling environment for mobility operators?\u201d\n\nOn some level, Odum\u2019s discourse reminds us of the current rave with the metaverse and how it could upend our lives and move. But in the realm of current reality, the possibilities remain endless and current players need to take action.\n\nThis platform, according to both executives, would be perfect for automotive manufacturers with a huge market in Nigeria.\n\nNames like Toyota, Volkswagen, and Mercedes readily come to mind. Considering the current state of vehicle manufacturing in Nigeria, there\u2019s a lot to be done.\n\nPer Okhae, the conference floor will be open to innovative young minds who are developing solutions for Africa\u2019s mobility sector. He also maintains that the security conversations would be relevant for anyone travelling in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHola,\n\nI\u2019m still riding the high of the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022), and one of the sessions that stood out to me was the Web3 Hackathon.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what the hackathon was about if you don\u2019t already know. The competition sought and rewarded Web3-based innovations, and it recognised teams that created impressive blockchain-based technologies.\n\nSo, following an editorial review of the teams that registered for the Hackathon, six teams were chosen to pitch their solutions to the judges virtually on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeep in mind that the teams were chosen based on the originality and uniqueness of their proposed solutions.\n\nFollowing the completion of the virtual programme, four finalists were chosen from the six teams to compete for cash prizes on Saturday, May 21, 2022. And three teams won the TABS Web3 Hackathon: Team Chemotronix, Team Block Baddies, and Team JPS.\n\nBolu detailed the process \u2014 how it began and ended \u2014 in writing here: Team Chemotronix, 2 others win $2,500 cash prize at TABS Web3 Hackathon\n\nIf you want to watch the hackathon live, kindly check out this link.\n\nSo, today I\u2019ll talk about two different stories that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy:\n\nThe new phone call tax\n\nSylndr\u2019s $12.6 million pre-seed round\n\nTaxing phone calls to help the \u201cVulnerable Group\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government is introducing a new phone call tax. This amounts to a 9% tax on phone calls at call rates of around 11kobo per second.\n\nThis implies that for every phone call you make, you will be charged at least one kobo per second.\n\nYou may be wondering why, given that the government collects income tax, value added tax, stamp duties, and other levies and taxes. Well, the government said they want to assist the \u201cVulnerable Group\u201d in receiving free healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you want to find out if you\u2019re a part of the group? You don\u2019t have health insurance, do you? \ud83d\ude09 To begin with, how many Nigerians have health insurance?\n\nAnyway, if you are a child under the age of five, a pregnant woman, an elderly person, physically or mentally challenged, or indigent, as defined from time to time, you are part of the group.\n\nMoreover, this new law is coming after President Buhari approved a 5% excise duty on telephone recharge cards and vouchers in May 2022. Also, remember that the government increased the VAT rate from 5% to 7.5% in 2020. This raises the question, what is the government using our taxes to do?\n\nIt\u2019s like you don\u2019t understand how much the government expects from this tax annually. For context, the Nigerian Communications Commission reported that Nigerians made 150.83 billion minutes of calls in 2020. =\n\nThis is 9.05 trillion seconds of calls, implying that the new tax will generate at least 9.05 trillion Kobo per year, or \u20a690.49 billion ($18.09 million). You see my point?\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re a regular reader, you\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t trust the Nigerian government. However, I think helping the vulnerable is a good idea if they do so, indeed.\n\nI mean, Nigeria is a poor country with only about 5 million Nigerians, or 3% of the population, covered by the NHIS, and these are mostly members of the formal sector, particularly federal civil servants. If done properly, this could potentially increase the number of people who have access to insurance.\n\nBut why telecommunications, and why now? Could it be because telecom operators in the country are growing faster than some sectors?\n\nAccording to Statista, Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry continues to contribute a larger share of national GDP, reaching 12.61 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAlso, MTN Nigeria is estimated to be worth \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) as of May 20, 2022. This is more valuable than the combined value of all Nigerian banks and insurance companies, which is \u20a64 trillion ($9.6 billion).\n\nFurther, in March, 2022, the country\u2019s telecommunications operators added 2.5 million new broadband users. This increased the country\u2019s total high-speed internet subscriptions to 80.6 million, up from 78.1 million in February.\n\nHowever, recall that the telecom companies proposed a 40% increase in the cost of calls, SMS, and data due to rising operating costs in the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Taiwo Oyedele, PwC\u2019s fiscal policy partner and Africa tax leader, warned the government of the potential consequences of taxing the telecom sector. He said that the sector is interconnected, and the tax burden can have an impact on the growth of other sectors of the economy.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re hoping the editorial team will provide an interesting perspective on such an interesting topic. Well, you\u2019re not wrong. \ud83d\ude0a You can listen to it here.\n\nSylndr\u2019s $12.6 million pre-seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does your ideal car cost? I\u2019m not talking about a used car; I\u2019m referring to the one we call \u201cbrand new\u201d or \u201ctear rubber.\u201d Expensive, right? That, I believe, explains why there is a demand in emerging markets for reasonably priced used vehicles.\n\nAnd in Egypt, brands such as GB Auto, Mansour Automotive, and Nissan have a high resale value. Even so, due to a variety of issues, including a lack of trust and affordability, the buying experience of such cars on classifieds can be disappointing.\n\nConsequently, Omar El Defrawy, co-founder and CEO of Sylndr \u2014 Egypt\u2019s automotive marketplace that allows customers to sell and buy used cars \u2014 wants to address the main issue of market mistrust between buyers and sellers of used cars.\n\nAnd yesterday, Monday, May 23, 2022, the company announced that it had raised a pre-seed round of $12.6 million.\n\nRAED Ventures led the funding. A number of regional and global angel investors, as well as Algebra Ventures, Nuwa Capital, 1984 Ventures, and Global Founders Capital, took part.\n\nThe company\u2019s yet to go public despite being founded in November 2021. Even so, it is modelled after India\u2019s Cars24, which acquires cars from individuals looking to sell, purchases them for an agreed-upon price, reconditions them, and then resells them to new owners.\n\nThe startup plans to generate revenue through retail sales, auction houses, dealerships, and B2B sales.\n\nAlso, El Defrawy claims that it may investigate ancillary revenue streams such as interest from financing, insurance, fees from roadside assistance, and other value added services.\n\nThe funds would be used to expand the company\u2019s operational capability, technology infrastructure, inventory growth, and the development of retail and non-retail customer channels.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort.

We also brought up a report that shows that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales.\n\nInterestingly, Autochek reached out to Chimgozirim to clear things up and we decided to kick off today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast with that.\n\nAs it turns out, the BNPL market for cars is huge and Autochek works with a lot of parties to provide the services they do. Chimgozorim\u2019s analysis of why it might seem like Autochek making a killing from interest rates is interesting and you can tune in to find out more.\n\nWe moved from Autochek to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) rules on cryptocurrencies. Like the Autochek story, we also discussed this last week but our panellists at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit had some exciting things to say about the SEC\u2019s rules.\n\nFounder of the Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), Chimezie Chuta, believes that the regulations issued by the SEC do not address the bigger picture when it comes to cryptocurrencies.\n\nSenator Ihenyen, President of Stakeholders in Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SiBAN) did not quite agree with Chuta. If you missed the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, and want to hear Ihenyen\u2019s view on the rules, you can tune in to the podcast or just see the video here.\n\nWe rounded off today\u2019s podcast with the Nigerian government\u2019s plan to tax calls to give you healthcare. Well, Chimgozirim and Oluwanifemi got into a heated debate about the issue, with arguments ranging from what the government does with the taxes it currently receives and why it is taking more taxes from Nigerians.\n\nFind out who wins the debate by following the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "title": "Telcos weigh strain as 5% airtime tax starts June",
          "text": "Starting from 1 June, every airtime recharge will attract a 5 percent tax that will go to the government, and telecommunications companies (telcos) are weighing the impacts it would have on the industry and consumers.\n\nExperts say the implementation of the tax will increase the burden of taxation that operators in the telecommunication industry are facing and could see consumers paying more for telecoms services.\n\nThe 5 percent tax on airtime was recently added and approved in the Finance Act 2021, which took effect from January 1, 2022. The tax was part of a new excise duty list that included beverages, non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nExcise duties are internal taxes that are levied on sale of specific goods and services, such as alcohol, fuel, and tobacco \u2013 often goods the government wants to discourage the use of. It is an indirect tax that is not paid by the customers directly \u2013 instead, the excise tax is imposed on the supplier or the producer, who then includes it in the product price.\n\nThe inclusion of telecommunication services provided in Nigeria is the most recent change to the excise duty regime in the country. In the case of airtime recharge, the government would impose it on the network operators, which will in turn pass it on the subscribers. President Muhammadu Buhari reportedly approved the 5 percent tax on airtime in May 2022.\n\n\u201cYes, it will affect the consumers of telecommunications services because the telecom companies are already asking for an upward review of the price paid by the consumer,\u201d said Ajibola Olude, chief operating officer of Association Telecommunication Companies in Nigeria (ATCON).\n\nThe proposal for 40 percent upward review of the price of telecom services was championed in a letter written by the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) on May 4, 2022, a day before President Muhammadu Buhari approved the 5 percent tax.\n\nThe 40 percent hike implies the price floor of calls will rise to N8.95 from N6.4, while the price cap for SMS increases to N5.61 from N4.\n\n\u201cWe are not proponents of the request but we supported it because it is obvious that there has been a general increase in the price level of everything,\u201d Olude said.\n\nAccording to the government, part of the proceeds from the tax will be used to fund free healthcare for the vulnerable group in Nigeria. This is included in the National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021 signed into law by Buhari last week.\n\nSection 26 subsection 1c of the new health law states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nThe health law describes the Vulnerable Group Fund as money set aside to pay for healthcare services for vulnerable Nigerians who cannot pay for health insurance. It is intended to subsidise the cost of provision of healthcare services to vulnerable persons in Nigeria. Nigerians under the vulnerable group include children under five, pregnant women, aged, physically, and mentally challenged persons, and indigent people as may be defined from time to time.\n\nGbenga Adebayo, chairman of ALTON, said the imposition of 5 percent tax on the industry constituted an additional burden on operators who are already grappling with multiple taxation.\n\n\u201cThe behaviour of the government is not helping things for anyone. As at today, we have about 36 levies and taxes against operators,\u201d Adebayo said in an interview on Channels Television. \u201cAn additional 5 percent excise tax has now been considered effective for the first of June. All of these affect the sector, and that\u2019s why we want the regulators to see that this is where we are.\u201d\n\nRead also: Telcos\u2019 planned 40% hike threatens digital inclusion drive\n\nRotimi Akapo and Quasim Odunmbaku, in their book, \u2018Nigerian Telecommunications Law and Regulations\u2019 published in 2021, identified 47 taxes and levies paid by telcos to the three levels of government in Nigeria. States and local government areas are involved in the collection of 32 taxes and levies.\n\nTelcos such as MTN have seen their tax contribution balloon in recent years as the government increases the number of taxes and levies. In 2021, for example, MTN paid N757 billion in taxes to all Nigerian government agencies and N618.7 billion to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), representing about 10 percent of the total N6.3 trillion remitted by the service in 2021. This is a significant increase from the N46.9 billion and N95.5 billion MTN paid in 2019 and 2020 respectively for company income tax to the FIRS.\n\nThe government is expecting to fund the Nigerian budget for 2022 from the proceeds of the 5 percent excise duty. At a function in 2021, Ben Akabueze, director-general of the Budget Office of the Federation, said Nigeria was lagging behind most of Africa in implementing the excise tax on the sector.\n\n\u201cLast year, we found that 51 countries in Africa have excise on airtime charges; so we are looking at that as well as an area (to tax),\u201d said Akabueze.\n\nHowever, while it benefits the government, it increases the cost of production for the industry which is not good for capital importation.\n\n\u201cI think the government should not base its revenue generation on the telecom and ICT industry more than necessary,\u201d Olude said. \u201cGovernment should direct the taxes collected to develop other sectors that have potential to give them further revenue.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for accelerated action among global stakeholders to bridge the funding gap in prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged and obstructed labour, without access to timely and quality medical treatment.\n\nObaseki made the call in commemoration of this year\u2019s International Day to end Obstetric Fistula, marked by the United Nations and its sister agencies, with the theme, \u201cEnd Fistula Now: Invest in Quality Healthcare, Empower Communities!\u201d\n\nThe governor, who linked the rising death from obstetric fistula to poor access to high-quality maternal health services, charged stakeholders to increase efforts at ending the menace by improving investment in strengthening health systems, as well as in research, awareness and prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn this year\u2019s International Day to End Obstetric Fistula, we must recommit to ending the scourge by strengthening our healthcare systems to guarantee quality maternal health services and ensuring improved access to treatment of one of the most serious and tragic childbirth injuries, which affects at least two million women and girls worldwide.\u201d\n\nObaseki said ongoing reforms in the healthcare system in Edo will guarantee access to quality reproductive health services, including access to skilled birth attendants and high-quality emergency obstetric care, and address preventable stillbirths, noting that the state has launched the \u2018Help Baby Survive\u2019 initiative, aimed at reducing the incidence of maternal and child mortality in the state.\n\nThe governor further added, \u201cAs a government, we are sustaining efforts at improving quality and affordable healthcare for women and children through the decentralization of our healthcare system and revamp of primary healthcare centres, equipping them with world-class equipment and manpower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have taken deliberate steps to ensure improved access to quality maternal health services and have embarked on several initiatives including the \u2018Help Baby Survive\u2019 initiative, to reduce the incidence of maternal and child mortality in the state.

          "text": "Angered by the alleged killing of its kinsmen in the South-East geo-political zone, the Coalition of Northern Groups on Tuesday vowed to retaliate.\n\nAccording to the coalition which threatened to boycott patronage of the media over what it termed bias by media managers on the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra and Eastern Security Network, killing of its prople had been greeted with the conspiracy of silence.\n\nSpokesperson of CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, who issued the threats in a statement made available to media houses, said it was \u201cin response to the incessant killing of Northerners in South-East\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe note that hate campaigns and propaganda being conducted by created by certain interest groups in the South-East in the form of regional and ethnic agitators have emboldened the outlawed terrorist IPOB/ESN to carry out these unprovoked evictions, attacks, killings, destructions of properties and other forms of violations against northerners in various parts of the South East.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly disturbed by the reports of the brutal murder of a mother and her four children for the only sin of being Northerners. This followed other reports that some trucks conveying goods to the South were also set ablaze in Anambra at the weekend and the drivers and other occupants were killed, injured or disappeared without a trace.\n\n\u201cIn sets of gory video clips trending online and seen by CNG, the victims were seen lying in the pool of their blood with bullets spread around and a narrator speaking in Igbo saying, \u201cEverybody should look at this video that they have shot a woman and her four children. They are from the North. And they are shooting everybody they see on the street; so people should be careful.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we also note the manifestation of a dangerous conspiracy of silence when days after the Sunday\u2019s killing of the Northerners without any provocation, the story has not been told by any of the national print and broadcast media despite wide coverage by the social media with graphic photos of the mayhem and condemnation by security operatives, groups and individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have watched and studied these events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity, to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against Nigerians collectively, and northerners in particular.\n\n\u201cThe intrinsic bias of the media and the double standards, hypocrisy and cowardice of regional, traditional, cultural, political and religious leaders from both the South and the North have become more glaring when they condemned the Deborah incident in Sokoto but conspiratorially and deliberately decline comments on the murderous activities of IPOB/ESN terrorists including the slaughter of a legislator.\n\n\u201cWe note also the deliberate attempt by the media and southern leaders to conceal the true identity of the murderous IPOB/ESN terrorists by concealing it as \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 while in actual sense they are known.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the activities of the IPOB/ESN terror groups are supported morally and politically by the vast majority of the pliant Igbo elites, politicians, traditional rulers, business persons, and the larger population of this ethnic group. It is also a situation that feeds on the docility of the affrighted section of those who pose as Northern leaders today.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks have pushed matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option, making it impossible for us to remain indifferent or silent in the face of such extreme provocations.\n\nAs the representatives of various interest groups from Northern Nigeria, the CNG today declares enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe North will no longer remain passive under such deliberate and sustained attacks on its people and interests, and will henceforth be forced to react to every provocation and unwarranted violation.\n\n\u201cThe North\u2019s reticence in speaking out or taking action is not born of fear or ignorance of how to respond in kind and those who tempt us should know that the North is no longer going to turn the other cheek.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, invite the attention of Southern leaders, their Northern collaborators and the bankrupt section of the Northern political elite and other authors of mindless violence and separatism who see it as their duty to actualise what their fathers started in 1966, to remember that people from other regions are residing and doing businesses all over the North and to warn them that we shall no longer be expected to turn the other cheek if Northerners would not be protected wherever they live as minorities in particularly Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also warn media operators of an imminent boycott of patronage all over the North unless they change to being more restrained and balanced in their reporting of all situations in the country, particularly when matters coming from or affecting northerners are reported or commented on.\n\n\u201cWe caution them to desist from and to eschew the slanted reporting of events with greater bias against a particular religious and ethnic group as is witnessed in the reporting of security situations recently.\n\n\u201cWe warn that editorial policies and restraints imposed by ordinary decency and sanity must not be abandoned by the media establishment for sensational and often biased reporting that only inflame tensions in the country\u201d, the group warned.",

          "text": "Telecom service providers in the country have kicked against the newly proposed tax on phone calls by the federal government.\n\nThe government had imposed a telecom tax in the equivalent of a minimum of one kobo per second for phone calls after President Muhammadu Buhari signed the National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021.\n\nAccording to the new law, this will be part of the sources of funds required to finance free healthcare for the Vulnerable Group in Nigeria.\n\nThe law includes a provision under Section 26 subsection 1c of the act which states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nHowever, the telecom providers under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), argued that the decision was contrary to the position of the government recently when they (the operators) announced plans to increase tariffs because of the high cost of diesel powering their base stations.\n\nAccording to the Chairman of ALTON, Engr. Gbenga Adebayo, telecom subscribers will bear the brunt of the new tax because they will now get less value for what they pay for. He adds that the operators will have no choice but to start deducting the tax from the subscribers\u2019 recharge once mandated by the government.\n\nThe ALTON Chairman said: \u201cFor us as at ALTON, it is bad fate on the part of government and I think it is badly intended. This is because when we came out that the government should look at our cost of operations and give us a room to review tariffs, everybody treated us like outcast.\n\n\u201cThe same government is now coming in a matter of days to say they are introducing new taxes. So, if we cannot review based on the impact it will have on subscribers, why are they bringing in another tax, still on subscribers. Government cannot act in one way and say another thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adebayo, tax could be introduced to another service, not a service that is so live-impacting like telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe reason for it is understandable, but we think it can be sourced from other sources, not telecoms subscribers, whom the government itself has said are suffering because of the high cost of living lately. We will not complain as operators because we will definitely remit, it is the subscribers that will bear the brunt. I say again that for us to have a sustainable industry, we must price right. Government cannot escape from this responsibility for a long time,\u201d he said",

          "text": "United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) yesterday said it had provided 102, 859 children with access to inclusive, equitable and quality education in a safe and protective learning environment in Borno State.\n\nUNICEF education manager in Maiduguri Field Office, Paola Ripamonti, made the disclosure at a press conference held on EduTrac System and the Mainstreaming of Psychosocial Support into Formal Education in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.\n\nRimamonti said the conference was aimed at highlighting the pilot of the EduTrac mobile phone-based data collection system and the mainstreaming of psychosocial support into formal education in Borno State.\n\nShe said the interventions were landmarks to improve educational planning, expand access to education for conflict-affected children and strengthen learning outcomes while also improving their mental health.\n\n\u201cBut first let me acknowledge all media professionals here for your support in promoting the wellbeing of vulnerable girls and boys in Borno State and across north-east Nigeria. From malnutrition to child protection, your unbiased reportage has helped to bring issues that affect children to the limelight. UNICEF commends your efforts as stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI also welcome all our partners not only for your presence here but your commitment to the implementation of the European Union Support to Response, Recovery and Resilience project to ensuring that vulnerable children in Borno State have equal opportunity to quality education, and to be the best version of themselves.\n\n\u201cThe project, which wraps up this month, has provided 102,859 children (51% girls) with access to inclusive, equitable and quality education in a safe and protective learning environment. A total of 29,985 out-of-school youths and adolescents (55% females) were supported with vocational skills, including poultry farming, shoe making, soap and bag production, tailoring, painting, and interlock tiles production.\n\n\u201cThese youths are back in their communities and earning income to provide for their family\u2019s basic needs. Some of them have even returned to school and are supporting their education with income earned from their businesses,\u201d said the UNICEF education manager.\n\nShe said among other achievements of the project, 30 schools have been constructed or rehabilitated, provided with furniture and have sex-segregated WASH facilities, adding that 58 temporary learning spaces were constructed or rehabilitated, and 28 vocational centres were established across six LGAs.\n\nShe added that the interventions supported over 300,000 children and youths (52% females), noting that among them were 20,104 (53% girls) out-of-school children who now accessed informal learning classes and 16,630 children (52% girls) who transitioned into the formal education system; and over 29,000 youths (55% females) gained employable skills through vocational training.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, 750 members of School-based Management Committees (44% females) have improved school management skills; 1,630 teachers and Community Volunteer Teachers (49% females) strengthened skills on various themes such as psycho-social support, gender-sensitive pedagogy and effective classroom management.\n\n\u201cThe education sector in north-east Nigeria is one of the worst hit by protracted armed conflict. Among many other interventions led by UNICEF, the European Union Support to Response, Recovery and Resilience project in Borno State led to a partnership with the state government to provide an integrated education response that generated demand for inclusive, and equitable quality education from communities, strengthened capacity of education personnel to gather and analyze school data for better educational planning and empowered school managers and community leaders as active participants in the education response,\u201d she further said.\n\nStakeholders at the press conference pleaded with UNICEF not to wrap up their intervention but to focus on how to take the intervention to the northern part of Borno State which was backward educationally even prior to the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries of the intervention narrated how it have improved their lives and thanked UNICEF for the intervention.",

          "text": "Terrorists who kidnapped passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna bound train that was attacked on 28th March 2022, have urged the government to release their children allegedly kept in a Yola detention facility.\n\nThey threatened to start killing the passengers in captivity within 7 days unless their demands are met\n\nLeaders of the terrorists spoke on phone to the spokesman of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, Malam Tukur Mamu, \u2018And Dan Iyan Fika.\n\nIn the audio of the conversations between Malam Tukur Mamu and the leaders of the terrorists that executed the Abuja-Kaduna train attack, the terrorists claimed that the Federal Government suspended the resumption of the train service because of their threats,\n\n\u201dThe government suspended the resumption of the train service indefinitely because of our threats and we repeat, if our conditions are not met, the resumption of the train service is to the detriment of the government and the passengers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need money. We have a good reason for doing what we did, until our demands are met none of the victims will come out alive even if it means we all die with them. They are well taken care of as you can see from the pictures we sent to you via WhatsApp but we assure you that this will not continue\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe choose you (Tukur Mamu) to convey this important message to the government, the families of the victims and Nigerians in general because we believe you won\u2019t alter our message and we have seen you severally with Sheikh Gumi in the forest, therefore, we recognized the fearlessness in you\u201d.\n\nThe leader of the terrorists; Abu Barra said that it\u2019s been two months since the abduction and anything can happen to the abducted passengers henceforth.\n\nHe explained their reasons for the abduction as a retaliation for the arrest and detention of their children by the security agencies.\n\n\u201cOur children numbering about 8 between the ages of one to seven years are currently being held at an orphanage in Jimeta, Adamawa State under the supervision of the Nigerian Army\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe names of our children are; Abdulrahman, Bilkisu, Usman, Ibrahim and Juwairiyyah. They were forcefully taken from our wives in Nasarawa and taken to the orphanage in Yola\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor any continued discussion on the release of these passengers and a safe resumption of the train service, our children must be released unconditionally. Only then we will release some of the abducted victims, especially the women while other passengers will be released on a prisoner exchange with some of our arrested comrades by the government, he continued.\n\nAbu Barra said that the pictures of the passengers they sent earlier, were among some of the pictures they sent to the negotiation team of the government as proof of the well being of the victims. They said since then the government had been lacklustre.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarra said they decided to come to a GSM enabled location with one of the female victims to talk to Malam Mamu and as a confirmation of their claims. Mamu said he could hear her cries with a very low voice that probably indicates exhaustion pleading with him to please talk to the government on their behalf for a swift intervention on their release.\u201d\n\nHe threatened that, if within seven days the government does not respond to their demands, they will stop feeding the victims and will start slaughtering them one after the other and if the government doesn\u2019t respond after that, then Nigerians should forget using the Abuja-Kaduna rail line as well as the Kaduna-Abuja high way.\n\n\u201cIf the government decided not to respond so be it. We are warning Nigerians, especially those that are patronizing the train that if this matter is not resolved peacefully, the day they decided to attack us or do anything funny, passengers or commuters should forget to use the train or follow the Abuja-Kaduna road because we will be consistent and they can\u2019t stop us. We believe that you will deliver this message as it is\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we rely on you and urged you to convey this important message to everyone\u201d, Abu Barra said.\n\nMalam Tukur Mamu replied that he understands the predicament of the government in resolving the abduction imbroglio but stated that every responsible government will look into saving innocent passengers\u2019 lives and make painful compromises where necessary even if it\u2019s against the policy of the administration.\n\nMalam Mamu then explained that prisoner exchange with known criminals on matters of national interest is a global practice and has happened in many developed countries like the United States.\n\nHe stressed the need to avoid any military action that will lead to collateral damage and the loss of innocent lives.\n\n\u201cTime is not on our side, the government must understand that they are dealing with persons with a misguided ideology and tainted religious belief. These people are not scared of death, they seem to believe that they are martyrs when they die. It will be a serious mistake to take this threat lightly. I believe an opportunity has been created for us to explore to save the lives of those innocent victims.\n\nFor me, if these innocent will regain their freedom because of my involvement and provided that will lead to relative peace and security on our highways and rail lines I wouldn\u2019t mind if I die in the process. We must accept the fact that security alone on the Abuja-Kadunvictima highways remains more fragile than ever and the solution is not militarily alone, especially in a country where impending attacks can hardly be dictated and stopped\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "Adamu: Non-assent to amended Electoral Act not ploy to elongate Buhari\u2019s tenure",
          "text": "The governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared that President Muhammadu Buhari will serve out his term and vacate the Presidential Villa as stipulated by law.\n\nThe opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had last night said the APC was behind the president\u2019s refusal to sign the amended Electoral Act Bill into law to achieve certain ends.\n\nAlthough the APC chair never made a direct reference to the PDP, his remarks were however a veiled reference to issues raised by the opposition party.\n\nInaugurating the Ekiti state governorship national campaign council in Abuja Monday, APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, dismissed concerns over any planned tenure elongation, urging the council to deliver Ekiti to the president as one of his parting gifts.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari is at the beginning of his trip out of the Presidential Villa. He made no secret of it. He is a man of honour, he seeks no extension. He made it public in this very hall that used to be our National Executive Committee NEC meeting hall. He said it that he has been elected for a second term. He is under oath as president to protect and preserve the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution has given him two terms of four years each. He has started his second term and at the end of it, he does not intend to, and will not ask for anybody to ask for a third term or any elongation of tenure.\n\n\u201cRecently, he made the same pronouncement sometimes early this year. So, we are on a boat like him to see that he has a soft landing and that is to deliver this party to victory and Ekiti state is the first test.\n\n\u201cSo, he takes this election very seriously. We would try to do as much as possible, we will be guided by the rules of engagement for elections, we will observe every rule, every guideline and we do hope that those who will be responsible for overseeing the compliance will be fair arbiters, will be fair referees, will be fair umpires.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope and prayer that God Almighty will be with us, will guide us, will ensure that victory is ours.\u201d\n\nDescribing Ekiti as the first election that the new National Working Committee (NWC) would be overseeing, Adamu said once there is a contest, there will be a winner and a loser, but that the APC will never be on the losing side.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take that for granted. We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that we deliver our gubernatorial candidate as the next Governor of Ekiti state.\n\n\u201cAs we inaugurate this committee, I have one thing in the marching order of this party and that is, don\u2019t come home crying, don\u2019t come home crying. If there is a cry, let them (opposition) go and cry for their principals, not us\u201d, he directed.\n\nIn his response, Chairman of the council and Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, recalled served in same capacity about four years ago, saying it is even now easier to secure victory as the APC is no longer in the opposition in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe committee members, Mr Chairman, you mentioned to me privately, why we have so many members in the campaign council and I agreed with you, particularly, Mr Chairman when some people do not appreciate the importance attached to this assignment.\n\n\u201cThis assignment should be acknowledged by all party members because we are only important when we are in power and we know Mr Chairman said we should not come back to complain. We could recall hilariously, Mr Chairman, the 2018 election in Ekiti state was an election in which stomach infrastructure was thrown at us in which someone broke his neck. Well, that is what was said officially all in an attempt to run away from the hard work of the NWC and the Campaign Council in ensuring that we could win Ekiti state.\n\n\u201cNow, we are even more competent because, in the last four years, Governor Kayode Fayemi has done a lot to ensure that Ekiti remains a progressive state.\u201d\n\nElection observers\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged Monday that political parties may have to go into the primaries without the statutory delegates even as some Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said it is too late to sign the document.\n\nThis position became clearer as President Buhari refused to assent to the Electoral Act amendment bill hurriedly effected by the National Assembly to accommodate the statutory delegates.\n\nAt the time of this report, many of the political parties had proceeded with the primary elections of their parties without recourse to the statutory delegates.\n\nSome CSOs, while reacting to the failure of President Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act amended to include the statutory delegates, said it\u2019s too late for the president to assent to the bill.\n\nA coalition of 24 election monitoring groups under the aegis of Coalition of Election Monitors and Observers (CEMO), Monday, cautioned the president against signing the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe coalition said signing the document few days to the crucial party primaries to elect presidential candidates would be a disservice to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nNational Convener CEMO Dr. Idris Yabu said this while presenting a report after the meeting of the coalition Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe group urged President Buhari to save the nation from a very serious political crisis by returning the amendment bill to the National Assembly for reprocessing for future elections.\n\nCEMO, noted that though the amendment was desirable, signing the bill after most political parties already commenced critical aspects of the electoral process under the current law is \u201cdangerous, counter-productive, capable of triggering widespread political crisis and litigations that can derail the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nYabu said: \u201cIt is now too late since political parties have already commenced activities for the 2023 elections under the provisions of the extant law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a very extensive review and consultations on the issue, we submit that the amendments sought to Section 84 of the Electoral Act 2022, as desirable as they may be, have been overtaken by events leading to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that political parties, especially the two major political parties in Nigeria have already started the electoral processes under the timelines, schedules and rules prescribed by the provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, it must be noted that political parties have already structured their timetables, sold nomination forms, screened aspirants, conducted congresses, elected delegates, with major parties already holding primaries and candidates already emerging under the rules provided for in the current Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, any alteration or amendment to the Electoral Act, at this moment, will amount to changing the rules in the middle of the game. Such will be \u201cdangerous and counter-productive to our democratic process. It will trigger widespread political crisis and result in litigations that can derail the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cOur observation shows that political parties, aspirants and the electorate have already adjusted to the current provision of Section 84 of the Electoral Act. Candidates are already peacefully emerging. Any alteration at this moment has the propensity of dislocating the current political tranquility in the country and disrupt the entire electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cCEMO therefore urges President Muhammadu Buhari to save the nation from a serious political crisis at this moment by returning the Amendment Bill to the National Assembly for reprocessing for future elections.\n\n\u201cCEMO also urges the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to advice Mr. President in this direction to avoid political crisis and ensure the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections,\u201d they said.\n\nAPC Professionals weigh in\n\nAlso, the APC Professionals has said the president has nothing to lose not signing the amended Electoral Act Bill into law.\n\nThey said: \u201cWith current position of the electoral act, the party has nothing to lose, either way, the APC stands a chance to conduct credible primaries across board. We and even Mr. President, have been advocating for the party to be returned to the people to select their leaders. By omission or commission, the expectation is for the delegates, not moneybag politicians, to determine who represents them in government. This will send a strong message to political office holders to account for their stewardship and never to detach themselves from the party that brought them to power.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed in this our government where political appointees close their doors to party that brought them to power, and expect them to be imposed by moneybags in power. This Electoral Act as currently amended, is a blessing in disguise. The legislators and members of the executive seem to be too focused in the scheming game plan rather than concentrate on thorough legislation and execution.\n\n\u201cThe President should not be pressured to sign the piece of legislation that may alter or derail the timetable of the electioneering process. It\u2019s a blessing in disguise for the electorates who are at most times at the mercy of political gladiators who care less about good governance. I will also advise the delegates to choose the country above dollars or naira that might be splashed on them by desperate politicians who are willing to use public money to secure tickets at the primaries.\n\n\u201cThe scenario is also a warning to desperate public office seekers to always participate in local politics, and not always depending on using stolen money and godfathers to impose them on the party. I don\u2019t think President signing the electoral act at this late hour will help anyone except INEC is willing to adjust their timetable. We have to learn from this situation so that we learn to put our house in order next time.\u201d\n\nLegal intervention\n\nIn another intervention, a senior lawyer, Moses Onyilokwu, told one of our correspondents that the Electoral Act does not have the section they wanted the president to sign.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey just amended it and when they were doing the amendment, they did not do a holistic amendment. Now, some of the primaries have been held, we are waiting for others.\n\n\u201cIf you say, sign it now so that statutory delegates will vote, what of the ones that have passed and statutory delegates did not vote? Are you going to hold new primaries in respect of those ones? Even if you do it now that the primaries have started, is it going to take effect on the 2023 or 2027 elections?\n\n\u201cSo, since they did not deem it fit to send it when they were amending the act earlier, I do not think that the President has done anything wrong in not signing it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that the President himself cannot vote because he is a statutory delegate.\n\n\u201cAlso, if it is signed now, some persons may also come up with litigations, troubles and more confusion here and there. So, I think we should leave it the way it is now, until may be the next elections.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, another senior lawyer, Celsus Ukpong, said the political appointees cannot be delegates or vote at the coming primaries except the law is amended.\n\nHe saipd: \u201cSo, there is no dilemma at all because the law must be followed to the letter. If they wanted political appointees to vote as delegates, what they should do is for the National Assembly to amend the law, if they amended it and the President has not signed it that means the law is not yet completed, so, we still fall back to what the law is at this stage.\n\n\u201cThat law as it were, was not meant to help or punished anybody, it was the law of this country.\n\n\u201cOn a final note, let me restate here that other delegates apart from the appointees will vote. So, if appointee wants to vote, they should resign.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",
          "summary": "\u201cIn this regard, any alteration or amendment to the Electoral Act, at this moment, will amount to changing the rules in the middle of the game.\n\u201cOur observation shows that political parties, aspirants and the electorate have already adjusted to the current provision of Section 84 of the Electoral Act.\nAPC Professionals weigh inAlso, the APC Professionals has said the president has nothing to lose not signing the amended Electoral Act Bill into law.\nThis Electoral Act as currently amended, is a blessing in disguise.\nI don\u2019t think President signing the electoral act at this late hour will help anyone except INEC is willing to adjust their timetable.",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Boris Johnson is facing fresh questions after photos showing the prime minister drinking at an event during a Covid lockdown were published.\n\nThe pictures, released by ITV News, are believed to show the prime minister at a leaving party on 13 November 2020.\n\nThe BBC has been told that at least one person who attended the event was fined, but the PM was not.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police are facing calls to explain why Mr Johnson did not receive a fine.\n\nA government source told BBC News the photos may have been taken by the official No 10 photographer and proved Mr Johnson was there in a work capacity.\n\nThe police investigated two events in Downing Street on 13 November. Asked in Parliament by a Labour MP whether a party had taken place on that date, Mr Johnson said \u201cno\u201d, adding that \u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026all the rules were followed\u201d.\n\nThe Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held\n\nWhat did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties?\n\nMeanwhile, a government source has also told the BBC that civil servant Sue Gray may hand her report on parties to Downing Street on Wednesday, followed by a statement in Parliament and a press conference by the prime minister.\n\nResponding to the leaks, Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth said it would be difficult for the PM to reconcile his statement to Parliament that no party had taken place with the pictures and called on Tory MPs to remove him from office.\n\nThe peer and former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, said the prime minister had lied to Parliament and his position was now untenable.\n\nSenior Conservative Tom Tugendhat was also critical telling the BBC that: \u201cSeriousness in government matters. It costs us all. And I\u2019m afraid this just doesn\u2019t look serious.\u201d\n\nFormer justice secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio Wiltshire that: \u201cIf there\u2019s a deliberate lie, I can\u2019t see how anybody, including this prime minister, can continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things we say honestly and genuinely at the time that we believe to be true\u2026 now that\u2019s one thing. Going and deliberately saying X is Y knowing that is the case is, of course, beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that while he found the picture \u201cdifficult to look at\u201d, he suggested the presence of the PM\u2019s ministerial red box \u201csuggests he was probably on his way through\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s popped down there to raise a glass and say thank you to a long term member of staff who is leaving,\u201d he said, adding that the police would have \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d the event.\n\nHe also said the prime minister was \u201cmortified\u201d.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman said the prime minister would address Parliament \u201cin full\u201d after senior civil servant Sue Gray published her report into the gatherings \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\n\nThere was support for the PM from Conservative backbench MP Sir Desmond Swayne, who said he believed it was a \u201cwork do\u201d, adding \u201cthat\u2019s what people do at work\u201d.\n\nHe told BBC Newsnight: \u201cNow I understand entirely the public anguish at a time when they were locked down and they were not supposed to be together, but there clearly was a distinction between the workplace \u2013 where people work together and are effectively in a bubble \u2013 and what was taking place outside.\n\nThe prime minister and the Met are under fresh scrutiny after ITV News published four new photographs on Monday which it says were taken at the leaving do for Mr Johnson\u2019s communications chief, Lee Cain on 13 November 2020.\n\nMr Johnson is pictured toasting colleagues while standing by a table laden with wine bottles, wine glasses, food and other drinks.\n\nA second coronavirus lockdown was in place in England at the time the photographs were taken, with indoor gatherings of two or more people banned, except if \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for work purposes.\n\nAllegations about gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall throughout the pandemic led to a Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 events.\n\nThe inquiry concluded last week, with a total of 126 fixed penalty notices being issued to 83 individuals for parties held over eight separate dates.\n\nMr Johnson, his wife Carrie, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak all received one fine each for attending a birthday party thrown in the PM\u2019s honour in June 2020.\n\nBut No 10 confirmed the PM was not facing any additional fines from the police.\n\nThe emergence of the photographs has sparked fresh claims from opposition MPs and others that Mr Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he previously told them no Covid rules had been broken in Downing Street.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Labour MP Catherine West asked Mr Johnson in the Commons if a party had taken place in Downing Street on 13 November 2020 \u2013 though it is not clear if she was referring to the event photographed.\n\nThe PM replied: \u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure whatever happened the guidance was followed and all the rules were followed at all times.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister faces a probe by the Commons\u2019 Privileges Committee about whether he lied to MPs. Under government guidelines, ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament are expected to resign.\n\nMPs are also awaiting the outcome of an investigation by Durham Police into a gathering in the city on 30 April 2021 attended by Labour leader Keir Starmer and his deputy Ms Rayner.\n\nSir Keir has said he will resign if he is fined for attending the event.\n\nMeanwhile, questioned about its decision making, the Met has declined to explain why the prime minister was not fined over the leaving party.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have written to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, urging it to investigate the Met\u2019s probe into events in No 10 and Whitehall during lockdown.\n\nThe party\u2019s deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cIf anyone else had been pictured at a party like this during lockdown, surely this would have been enough evidence for them to be fined.\u201d\n\nThe Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he though the police should \u201cexplain why they have reached their conclusions and provide that clarity\u201d.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman said the Cabinet Office and the police had been given access to information, including photographs.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "The cost of importing petroleum products of all kinds into Nigeria has soared to over $28 billion on an annual basis, Blackgold Energy Authorities, an oil and gas consulting and advisory firm, has revealed.\n\nThe Principal Consultant, Blackgold, Dr. Oladunni Owo, disclosed this on.Monday in Lagos at the ongoing two-day Nigerian Content Midstream/Downstream Oil and Gas Summit, with the theme: \u201cTowards Maximising Potential in the Midstream and Downstream Oil & Gas Sector \u2013 A Local Content Perspective.\u201d\n\nThis was just as the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, also disclosed at the event that Nigerian firm, Temile Development Company Limited, would this week sign an agreement with a South Korean shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, for the construction of the second Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) vessel under the $120 million contract earlier signed in 2018.\n\nIn her presentation at the summit, on the topic, \u201cChallenges and opportunities in the Nigerian petroleum refining sector\u201d, Owo put Nigeria\u2019s per capita refining at 0.002 barrels per day, describing the situation as embarrassing.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total import for petroleum products is about $28 billion per annum. Nigeria is the largest producer of crude in Africa and third largest importer of refined products in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s per capita refining is about 0.002 barrels per day, that\u2019s very embarrassing,\u201d she stated.\n\nOwo stated that the country had not done enough in building refining capacity, saying in 2015, about 65 modular refinery licenses were approved by the federal government.\n\nAccording to her, of those 65, only few including Waltersmith Refinery and Niger Delta Refinery have commenced production.\n\nShe said the refining sector had been tainted with, \u201cuncertainty due to adverse effect of regulator, subsidy, poor maintenance, general operational failure, inconsistencies, supply of feedstock, vandalisation, piracy, all sorts and all kinds.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this is just to bring out the fact that our consumption is high and our import is also very high.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, after the delivery of the first Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) vessel in 2020, out of a two-vessel-building contract valued at over $120, signed in July 2018 between Nigerian oil and gas company, Temile Development Company Limited and South Korean shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, will this week sign agreement for the construction of the second vessel.\n\nWabote, who disclosed this in his welcome address at the summit, said the agreement signing for the vessel construction between the two companies would be one of the key highlights of the World Gas Conference holding this week in South Korea.\n\nWabote said that the vessel owned by a local indigenous company would further enhance the supply capability of the LPG across the country.\n\nHe explained that the agreement for the first vessel was signed in 2018, and that the vessel was delivered in 2020, noting that agreement for the second vessel was a sign of self-propelled growth for Nigerian indigenous companies in the midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cAs you may be aware, the World Gas Conference is holding this week in South Korea. One of the key highlights at the event is the signing of the agreement construct the 2nd LPG Vessel owned by a local indigenous company to further enhance the supply capability of the LPG across the country.\n\n\u201cAgreement for the first vessel was signed in 2018 and the vessel was delivered in 2020. I am pleased to note that agreement for the second vessel is being executed which is a sign of self-propelled growth for our indigenous companies in the midstream and downstream sectors of the industry\u201d, Wabote stated.\n\nHe, however, said the initiatives put in place by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, in line with the Decade of Gas declaration of the federal government was the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) with three key elements namely Domestic LPG Expansion, Autogas, and Power Generation.\n\nHe said the Domestic LPG Expansion element of the programme targeted 20 million homes to increase the country\u2019s LPG penetration currently estimated at national average of 13 per cent.\n\nHe said a glimpse of the LPG value chain in the country presented another plethora of opportunities for which the board had also gone into partnership with some investors to develop different areas of the value chain.\n\nWabote maintained that the NCDMB\u2019s touchpoints in the LPG value chain covered inland LPG production, LPG jetties/terminals, storage facilities, inland transportation, cylinders manufacturing, bottling, and retail.\n\nHe added that their partnership investments in the gas value-chain included Partnership with NEDO Gas Processing Company in Kwale, Delta State, for the establishment of 80 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas processing plant and a 30mmscfd Kwale Gas Gathering hub.\n\nOthers, according to him included \u201cpartnership with Triansel Gas Limited in Koko, Delta State, for the 5,000MT LPG Storage and Loading Terminal Facility; Partnership with Brass Fertiliser for the development of a 10,000MT/day Methanol Plant at Odiama in Brass\n\n\u201cPartnership with Butane Energy to roll out LPG Bottling Plants and Depots in Abuja and 10 Northern States of Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Bauchi, Nassarawa, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Gombe, and Jigawa states; Partnership with Southfield Petroleum for the establishment of 200MMscfd gas processing plant at Utorogu, Delta State to produce 123,000MTPA of LPG.\n\n\u201cThis represents about 10 percent of current LPG demand nationwide which will be produced in-country instead of being imported; Partnership with MOB Integrated Services for the construction of the 500MT Inland LPG terminal which is currently in operation at Dikko, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe partnership includes the construction of a Cylinder Refurbishment plant, procurement of 80,000bottles of LPG Cylinders and acquisition of distribution assets consisting of Bridgers, bobtails and cylinder distribution trucks to enhance LPG penetration across the target catchment areas.\u201d\n\nThe executive secretary said the board also had partnership with Amal Technologies to set up plant in Abuja for the production of Smart Gas/Smoke Detector Alarm devices that monitors and detects smoke and all types of gas leakages thereby enhance the safe usage of LPG in our homes.\n\nHe expressed delighted that the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the African Export Import Bank (Afreximbank) to set the ball rolling in addressing the funding challenge in the continent\u2019s oil and gas sector\n\nWabote said based the board\u2019s 10-year Strategic Roadmap to achieve 70 per cent Nigerian Content target in the Nigerian oil and gas industry by the year 2027, the midstream and downstream sectors of the industry represented key areas to derive and extract value to meet their set target.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "title": "Higher Energy Prices Could Trigger Global Recession, IEA Warns",
          "text": "A rise in energy demand in the summer could send prices higher and risk a global recession, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol has warned.\n\nBirol, who called on, \u201ceverybody in the global energy markets\u201d to do what they can to keep a lid on prices, told Bloomberg TV in an interview on the sidelines of the ongoing World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday, that all players in energy markets should make a, \u201cpositive contribution\u201d to avert price rises.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nHis warning came as multiple threats to the global economy topped the worries of the world\u2019s well-heeled at the annual Davos think-fest, with some flagging the risk of a worldwide recession.\n\nPolitical and business leaders are meeting in Davos against a backdrop of inflation at its highest level in a generation, in major economies including the United States, Britain and Europe.\n\nThe Chairman of the WEF, Prof. Klaus Schwab called for a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, said the war in Ukraine, tighter financial conditions and price shocks, for food in particular, have clearly \u201cdarkened\u201d the outlook in the month, noting however, that she was not yet expecting a recession.\n\nThe IMF had last month cut its global growth outlook for the second time this year, citing the war in Ukraine and singling out inflation as a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d for many countries.\n\nOn her part, European Central Bank (ECB) President and immediate-past IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, who was expected to speak in Davos today, has warned that growth and inflation were on opposing paths, as mounting price pressures curb economic activity and devastate household purchasing power.\n\n\u201cThe Russia-Ukraine war may well prove to be a tipping point for hyper-globalisation,\u201d she said in a blog post on yesterday.\n\n\u201cThat could lead to supply chains becoming less efficient for a while and, during the transition, create more persistent cost pressures for the economy,\u201d Lagarde added.\n\nAccording to agency reports, the WEF Chairman, Prof. Klaus Schwab, in his opening remarks at the Davos meeting said: \u201cOur first thoughts are with the war in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s aggression on their country will be seen in future history books as the breakdown of the post-World War II and post-Cold War order.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why we speak about a turning point in history. In Davos, our solidarity is foremost with the people suffering from the atrocities of this war.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the repercussions on oil and food markets of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February \u2013 which Moscow described as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, and COVID-19 lockdowns in China with no clear end have compounded the global gloom.\n\nAccording to German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck: \u201cWe have at least four crises, which are interwoven. We have high inflation \u2026 we have an energy crisis\u2026 we have food poverty, and we have a climate crisis. And we can\u2019t solve the problems if we concentrate on only one of the crises.\n\n\u201cBut if none of the problems are solved, I am really afraid we are running into a global recession with tremendous effect .. on global stability,\u201d Habeck said during a WEF panel discussion.\n\nEnergy prices have risen sharply in 2022 after Russia, a major supplier, invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\nThe comment by Birol that a rise in energy demand in the summer could send prices higher and risk a global recession came in the context of a sharp rise in global energy prices as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWestern countries are trying to cut their reliance on Russian energy, with the European Union (EU) trying to reach an agreement on a total ban of oil imports from the country.\n\nBirol said these efforts were necessary to punish Russia, but warned they increased the risks for energy markets and the world economy.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "title": "Lagos Develops Off-Grid Electrification Strategy, Action Plan",
          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Lagos State Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Monday announced that it had developed the Lagos State Off-Grid Electrification Strategy and Action Plan with support from the British-funded Africa Clean Energy Technical Assistance Facility (ACE-TAF).\n\nThe government said the programme, which was being implemented by Tetra Tech International Development and funded by the UK\u2019s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), was geared towards improvement of the off-grid energy access in Lagos State.\n\nSpeaking during the formal handover ceremony in Ikeja, the Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Engr. Olalere Odusote, explained that the ministry was working to improve energy access in the state. He recalled that in 2021, the government developed the Lagos State Electricity Policy to articulate its vision for creating a viable sub-national electricity sector that catered fully to the needs of its citizens, while also enabling significant socio-economic growth.\n\nOdusote explained that with the emergence of the off-grid solar sector as an important component in achieving access to energy for all in the State, the ministry had developed the Lagos State Off-Grid Electrification Strategy and Plan with the support of ACE-TAF to ensure the implementation of the electricity policy.\n\nSpeaking also at the event, ACE-TAF Nigeria Country Manager, Mr. Chibuikem Agbaegbu, said he was delighted to see the collaboration with Lagos State government to improve energy access to Lagosians. Agbaegbu said in 2021, AC-TAF had committed to supporting the state government in improving the environment for off-grid solar. The organisation had done so through its support in the development of the Lagos State Electricity Policy and the Lagos State Off-Grid Electrification Strategy and Action Plan, he said.\n\nAgbaegbu stated that the Off-Grid Electrification Strategy and Plan further underscored the state government\u2019s commitment to clean off-grid electrification, thereby enabling private sector investment in its off-grid electricity market.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State government Monday said its attention had been drawn to a video circulating online showing officials of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) at Alaba-Rago Market.\n\nThe video, according to a statement by the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, was accompanied by a voice, which was not that of any official of the two agencies.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe voice is that of a faceless blogger trying to whip up ethnic and political sentiments over the planned relocation of traders for the remodelling of Alaba Rago Market.\n\n\u201cThe video is authentic because Commander, RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi and Chairman, Lagos State Task Force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, were in Alaba Rago last Thursday, to brief the traders on the planned relocation. The traders have 14 days to vacate the area to pave the way for the re-modelling.\n\n\u201cAlaba Rago is occupied by traders from many parts of Nigeria and neighbouring West African countries. Any insinuation towards any ethnic attack is a lie and purveyors of such are mischievous.\n\n\u201cIt is a devious attempt to cause trouble among peaceful traders. Such actions should be disregarded. Engagements are ongoing towards a hitch-free temporary relocation of the traders.\u201d\n\nIt further pointed out that the planned relocation was part of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration\u2019s Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cLagos State Government and the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing have just demolished market stalls under Apongbon Bridge ahead of the reconstruction of the bridge, which got burnt.\n\n\u201cIt is illegal to bring ethnic, religious or political colourations to such an exercise, which is designed to ensure development and better security in our communities.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of some locally made shotguns by Ojo Police Division a few weeks ago was part of many other reports that prompted the government to expedite action on the remodelling of this market.\n\n\u201cAbout 4:00 a.m. on April 3, 2022, officials of RRS intercepted a busload of illicit drugs at Mile 2 en route Mushin. The suspects confessed that the consignments were loaded at night in Alaba Rago.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos-Badagry Expressway is an international route. It will be insensitive of the government not to redevelop an unplanned and filthy market, such as Alaba Rago, with many shanties lined up on such an international route.\n\n\u201cBesides, Alaba Rago is directly opposite the Lagos State University, Ojo Campus. Keeping a very busy market like that directly opposite a reputable institution of learning is not right.\u201d",
