Peter Mbah, weekend, said that the state should be regarded as an oil-producing state due to the quantity of crude oil and mineral deposits in the state.\n\nHe said that apart from Oil Prospecting License, OPL 916 with 13 oil wells which the state shares with Anambra and Kogi States, it also has three other oil fields.\n\nHe made the disclosure at the university town of Nsukka during his thank-you-visit to members of PDP at Adada House in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\n\u201cWe would revamp our energy and oil sectors if you give us your mandate in 2023 election. We have OPL 916 which has lateral formations across Anambra, Enugu, and Kogi States. Out of its 13 oil wells, 11 are already producing. So, Enugu should be an oil-producing state.\n\n\u201cApart from the OPL 916, Enugu State has three other oil fields; including OPL 905, 907 and 914. We have the data of the oil deposits in these fields and we would begin to make money from them. We have a lot of other mineral resources such as limestone, and coal among others,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile commending Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, for provision of adequate security of lives and properties in the state and for the prompt payment of workers salaries, he pledged to consolidate on his achievements, adding that he would grow the state\u2019s economy from its present \u20a64.4 billion to \u20a630 billion when he becomes the governor of the state.\n\nHe also said that he would achieve a zero percent rate in poverty head count in the state, adding that the state would operate on government-driven private sector economy.\n\n\u201cThe nation is in dire economic strait. What this means is that we may not be relying on federal allocations alone to run the state.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen the level of insecurity in our country today. So, we already have existential threats and looming danger both as a people and as a country. Therefore, we need people who can profer solutions to these problems because we have compelling social and national problems. Therefore, we need creative minds who can think out of the box and people who have aversion for convention in solving these problems.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will not regret the decision you made on the 25th May, 2022, which produced me as the governorship candidate of People\u2019s Democratic Party in our state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairman of Nsukka Local Government Area, Barr. Walter Ozioko, while making his remarks said that the local government is for the PDP, assuring the gubernatorial candidate that he would be victorious at the polls in 2023.\n\n-30-\n\nPhoto:R-L: PDP governorship candidate in Enugu State, Barr.

The fight for quality education for the children of the masses has become a class war among the economic elite, the working class and the ruling class and until we rise up and demand accountability from those in office to do what is in the best interest of the majority, cycle of strikes and underdevelopment will not stop.\n\n\u201cNigerians continue to elect people who don\u2019t care about them. We worship those who have money than those with right virtues and have interest of the society at heart.\n\n\u201cOur renegotiation ought to have ended by 2012 but here we are in 2022 and yet the government is playing games with us.\n\n\u201cWe are asking for a renegotiation of existing agreements that will position our members as human beings working in a decent place.\n\n\u201cWe are asking for Revitalization of Public Universities through appropriate funding.\n\n\u201cWe are saying we have a better homegrown alternative of University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS), we are saying check proliferation of Universities that you cannot fund and we are saying Nigerians deserve to be ranked among top 100 in the world if our leaders invest in education.\n\n\u201cWe should be developing our own solutions not depending on others.

          "text": "Dr. Dapo Thomas is a lecturer in History and International Relations at Lagos State University (LASU). For eight years he served as Special Assistant to the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during his two terms as Lagos State governor. In this interview with EFEMENA ONODJAE , he recounts his experiences working with his erstwhile boss, shedding light on the man his opponents seek to define in unflattering ways.\n\nHow did you meet Bola Ahmed Tinubu?\n\nI met him in 1991 through my uncle, Dr Frederick Fasegun Machado. He was a big politician in Lagos State before he died. The two of them were in the same Dapo Sarumi faction of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Besides, Bola Tinubu\u2019s campaign office was right opposite my house in Otigba Street now known as Computer Village, Ikeja. At that time, the young members of the SDP rebelled against Alhaji Lateef Jakande for what they called: \u201cOga Sope\u201d. The rebellion was led by Dapo Sarumi, Kola Oseni, Segun Machado, Hakeem Giwa, Bola Tinubu, Sunbo Onitiri, Ademola Adeniji-Adele, Yomi Edu, Rahman Owokoniran, Omolayo Thomas and AA in Alimosho. Most of the \u201crebels\u201d were from Lagos Island. The Jakande faction was led by Muniru Baruwa, Ol\u00e1t\u00fanj\u00ed Hamzat, father of the present Deputy governor of Lagos State, Prof. Agbalajobi and others. It was an exciting rebellion that saw the two factions presenting two gubernatorial candidates against the NRC sole candidate, Sir Michael Otedola, Femi Otedola\u2019s father. Eventually, the national exco of SDP disqualified both Sarumi and Agbalajobi and settled for Yomi Edu as governorship candidate and my uncle as his deputy. In the general election, SDP lost to Otedola because the Jakande faction decided to vote for NRC against the SDP. I was a journalist then with the Daily Times. It was in the course of reporting all these events that I got so close to the group in general and Bola Tinubu in particular. All my exclusive reports then were as a result of this closeness and connection to the Sarumi group.\n\nHow did you come to work for him?\n\nIt was in 1991, during the NRC and SDP election. I was on the campaign train for the group so that I could get exclusive stories from them. As a result of this involvement, I got so close to all of them. One day while preparing to go out for campaign, my uncle just said it casually to Tinubu: \u201cBola, this is my brother. He lives opposite you. He is a journalist. Please take care of him.\u201d That house belongs to Kafaru Tinubu. His children, Wale and Deji Tinubu, were like my brothers because they were friends to my younger brother who died in February this year. Tinubu was using the top floor of the three-storey building as his campaign office while Kafaru Tinubu and his family were on the second floor. He was contesting for the Lagos West Senatorial seat. That\u2019s how we started our relationship.\n\nWhat is your reaction to those who argue that because Tinubu never went to the Southeast to campaign in the period leading to the primary, he\u2019s therefore not friendly towards the zone?\n\nWe are in a season of propaganda. One of my friends who is from the Southeast called my attention to the fact that he (Tinubu) did not visit the zone during the primary \u2013 an accusation that I later confirmed to be true. All these are unfortunate. However, I want to disagree with you on some of the things you said about him.\n\nI disagree with you that he\u2019s an ethnic bigot. In the whole Southwest when he was governor of Lagos State, Tinubu was the only one who appointed two notable Igbo sons into his cabinet. These guys are still in government at the state and federal levels. I am talking about Joe Igbokwe and Ben Akabueze. I will want you to help me find out if we had or have any Igbo governor who appointed two Yoruba sons into their cabinets between 1999 and 2007.\n\nSecondly, we employed 2,000 graduates in year 2000 to usher in the new millennium. As the Special Assistant, I was given some slots. Through one of my Igbo friends and my younger sister, two Igbos were on my list. The then Head of Service (HOS) wanted to remove them from the list. I reported to Tinubu and he summoned the HOS and scolded him in my presence. He told him: \u201cAre Igbos not Nigerians? My instruction was clear: let us employ 2,000 Nigerians to usher in the new millennium. I didn\u2019t say Lagosians\u201d. The two of them are directors in the Lagos State civil service today. Another Igbo that I got into LASU through Tinubu is Secretary to the VC as at today. Please go and ask for Mrs. Onwordi in LASU. With these little facts I gave you, I am sure you will agree that Tinubu doesn\u2019t hate Igbos.\n\nWhat is your take on APC\u2019s same-faith ticket?\n\nThis is one of the evil backlashes of Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s \u2018Maradonic\u2019 dribbles when he was the president for eight years. You know because of his desperation to hang on to power, there was no evil shrine that Babangida did not visit for communion service with power deities. It must have been during one of such consultations that he was told to tinker with the peace of the nation. One peaceful morning, the man just woke up to inform the nation that Nigeria had joined the Organisation of Islamic countries (OIC). Some of us thought it was a joke by a man who considered everyday April Fool\u2019s day. Though we were told that we had withdrawn from the organisation officially after so much hoopla, the nation had already inhaled the stench of this religious putrefaction with its attendant eternal contamination. Having given you the background to this fragile insanity, let me submit that as a social scientist, there is no way I can condemn a political party which prioritises electoral victory above religious mollification. My position is hinged on the belief that politicians, regardless of their operational territories, invest in the enterprise called politics with one sole objective: to win power. The strategy is to always place premium on expediency rather than impropriety. How do you go for an arrangement that pacifies a section of your party members but guarantees you no electoral victory? What is the cost or consequence of an arrangement that makes a section of your membership happy in the short run but leaves the entire party spectrum in quandary in the long run? I am so sure that all relevant variables, both dependent and independent, must have been evaluated and interrogated before the final decision was made. We should always remember that whoever becomes President, the Vice President, the governor or the deputy governor ceases to be a Christian or a Muslim as he becomes father of the nation or father of the state as the case may be. When you vote for a candidate as President and another one as Vice President and you expect them to be operating in their different religious modes, you are calling for anarchy. By doing this, we are helping to fester Babangida\u2019s concentric anomaly thereby engendering the polity and our territorial space.\n\nIf Tinubu is going to lose the election, it should not be for this tendentious hyphenated combo tagged Muslim-Muslim ticket. During his tenure as governor, he was more sympathetic and sentimental towards Christians. He was very close to Wilson Badejo, former General Overseer of Foursquare Gospel Church, Methodist Primate Sunday Mbang, RCCG General Overseer, Pastor E.A Adeboye. He was the one who initiated the \u201cJanuary Thanksgiving\u201d held at the Government House. This has been on since 2001 till date. In fact, Pastor Adeboye presides over it year in, year out. It was during his time that LASTMA was drafted to Redemption Camp to control traffic. I know they are still being used for traffic purpose till today. I supervised the deployment in 2002 in conjunction with Pastor Fola Aboaba who sent us the request letter.\n\nI don\u2019t think any of these three pastors I have mentioned earlier will tell their members not to vote for Tinubu. Tinubu, like any Lagos boy, is very liberal when it comes to religion and that\u2019s the way we do it in Lagos. Hardly can you find a family in Lagos that doesn\u2019t have this religious amalgam. I am a Pentecostal Christian and my mother and some of my siblings are Muslim. I never made any attempt to convert them because it is the way we do it in Lagos. So, the fear that Tinubu will subscribe to an Islamisation agenda is unfounded. Let one person come forward with incontrovertible evidence to show that he had that tendency when he was Lagos State governor for eight years.\n\nHis role in NADECO\n\nNADECO was a movement founded by some activists to help restore and promote democracy which we lost in 1983 when the Buhari-Idiagbon government removed Shehu Shagari from office in a bloodless coup. We were almost regaining it when Babaginda truncated it in 1993. NADECO was thus formed in May 1994 after Sanni Abacha removed Ernest Shonekan as Interim National Government Chairman and declared himself the new Head of State. M. K. O. Abiola who won the election was arrested and killed in jail. Most human rights activists and politicians including Tinubu, operating within the Nigerian space went into exile when they saw the spate of assassinations going on in the country. Tinubu was the major financier of the NADECO movement. The international community recognised NADECO as the mouthpiece for Nigeria\u2019s democratic struggle. Consequent upon its campaign, most countries did not recognise Abacha\u2019s government. A lot of things happened during that time. So, by the time Abacha died, Abubakar Abdulsalam who succeeded him quickly came up with a transition programme to usher in the present republic. As they say, the rest is history.\n\nWith his supposed health challenge can he lead a country like Nigeria?\n\nYour question reminds me of what Ayo Fayose said when Muhammadu Buhari won the 2015 presidential election. He said Buhari would not live long in power because of his health. But because Fayose is not God look at Buhari, he is still kicking. He did the first term, he didn\u2019t fall. He is almost completing his second term and he is still standing. So, what health challenge does Tinubu have? He did knee surgery, so what? Knee surgery is not a terminal disease. People are saying that his hands are shaking and therefore he cannot hold the flag. Some even said he cannot hold biro. I have some documents that he minuted on with his own hand in my library. The only difference between the two of us is that what will take me five minutes to write may take him 6 minutes. Even with all of that, he still performed well as Lagos State Governor. Do you know that since Tinubu came back from London in June 2021, he has only travelled out once and that was before the primary. He only spent one or two weeks. That was when he went to London to meet with members of APC London. Since then, he has been traveling all over the country moving to the north and south, east and west. The man was not relenting in his campaign and this showed in the results of the primary when he defeated his opponents with a landslide.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any health challenge with Tinubu. It\u2019s unfair for people to talk about what they don\u2019t know. Before the primary, he was moving to every nook and cranny of Nigeria, meeting with traditional rulers and delegates. If you know him very well, he does not joke with his campaign at all. Look at the result of his campaign in 2003. He was the only governor in the Southwest that won his election. The PDP took all the states except Lagos. He was then referred to as the last man standing.\n\nAge saga\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with his age. He is 70. Besides, when you are a politician, everything about your anatomy comes under public interrogation. Your opponents, for public entertainment, take delight in creating controversies around you as a way of distracting you from things that are of more strategic importance.",

          "title": "Road to 2023: Tinubu\u2019s choice of Muslim-Muslim ticket anachronistic, senseless, says former police boss Simon Okeke",
          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi\n\nFormer Chairman of Police Service Commission, Chief Simon Okeke, has described the Muslim-Muslim ticket the All Progressives Congress (APC)\u2019s candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has adopted for the 2023 presidential election as anachronistic and senseless.\n\nHe said for the APC candidate, Tinubu to have overlooked the multi-religious nature of Nigeria was a great error that would not be tolerated by the Christians.\n\nChief Okeke in a telephone interview was of the opinion that Tinubu should have recognised the Muslim-Christian pair as had been the case in the past in the issue of presidency.\n\nHe cited past presidents ranging from the former Prime Minister of Nigeria at Independence, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Belewa, a Muslim with Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, a Christian and a ceremonial President through the Muslim military heads of state and their Christians Chief of Army Staff; President Shehu Shagari, a Muslim and his Vice, Alex Ekwueme, a Christian; President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian and his Vice, Atiku Abubakar, a Muslim; Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Ebele Jonathan up to Muhammadu Buhari and Prof Yemi Osibanjo who are Muslim and Christian, respectively.\n\nHe expressed disappointment in Tinubu\u2019s action as, according to him, no leader of Nigeria had ever led with the same faith in the history of the country, saying that it had always been either Muslim-Christian or Christian-Muslim.\n\nChief Okeke said it appeared Tinubu had bought into the idea of Islamising Nigeria as feared by some Christians.\n\n\u201cIt is unthinkable. It is impunity that cannot be tolerated. We will see how far he can go. It is absolutely not acceptable and very anachronistic. It will not work,\u201d he insisted.\n\nHe berated the APC and the PDP for not considering an Igboman for a presidential ticket. He traced the leadership history of Nigeria since 1960 and asserted that no Igboman had ever been elected president of Nigeria.\n\nEvery Nigerian, he said, had expected that it would be the turn of an Igboman to become president this time but regretted that the Igbo were schemed out from the major political parties which he said made Mr Peter Obi defect from the PDP to join the Labour Party.\n\nHe noted that Obi left when he saw the handwriting on the wall.\n\n\u201cHe decamped from the PDP to join LP. As soon as he joined the LP, he was unanimously accepted in the East, North and West, all over the country. He is a movement now. My advice to Igbo and indeed all Nigerians is that you already know where to put in your vote. You should be \u201cobedient\u201d as the saying goes, \u201d he said.\n\nChief Okeke also advised Mr Peter Obi to be security conscious in his movement across the country.\n\nOn security challenges, he said it was surprising that experts in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), cyber security experts and service providers in Nigeria could not checkmate rising cases of kidnapping.\n\nIn a telephone interview with our Correspondent, Chief Okeke noted that it was an indictment to the stakeholders in the communication industry to claim to be experts in their fields when kidnappers could comfortably kidnap their victims, and negotiate for ransom without being located.\n\nHe noted that the situation had made kidnapping a lucrative and thriving business since those who called themselves ICT and cyber security experts including service providers in Nigeria proved to be confused as they watched the hoodlums having their way undisturbed on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cSomeone will be kidnapped and the kidnappers call their victim\u2019s family, negotiate for so much money and will never be located. It is an indictment of those who claim to be experts. I feel disappointed that this is going on in Nigeria. I don\u2019t know about other countries.\n\n\u201cThose that are experts on security issues should do more work on kidnapping and negotiation for ransom. Once they are able to identify the kidnappers during their negotiations and deal with them, kidnapping will certainly reduce.\n\nOn Anambra security, the former police boss commended Governor Charles Soludo on his security strategies to save lives and property in the state.\n\n\u201cSecurity is cost-effective and financial resources are required to secure lives and property. I think Governor Soludo is trying. He has tried to raise money from private individuals who have responded comfortably.\n\n\u201cHe is doing well. A lot of security challenges are going on, especially about those unknown gunmen or whatever you call them. I\u2019m satisfied with what the Governor has done so far, trying to dislodge the unknown gunmen in forests, bushes and all the enclaves where they are.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that in a little way I give the Governor my own advice including the Commissioner of Police, Anambra State, the Director of State Service (DSS) in Anambra and the Commander, Onitsha Garrison. I do speak with them and we discuss from time to time. They are all very much concerned in the security of the state,\u201d he said.",

Echono includes the need for curriculum review, skill acquisition/Entrepreneurship, advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as deepening Research, Development and Innovation.\n\n\u201cOthers are the provision of funds for capacity building of lecturers to equip them with requisite skills for Entrepreneurial Studies and Research Studies in Digital Technologies and prepare Nigerian students for global competitiveness with the end goal of building a knowledge economy and increasing the country\u2019s global presence.\n\n\u201cHe has also initiated a series of partnerships with notable institutions globally and locally, such as the University of Brazil, Vicosa on tuition-free agreements for the training of more Nigerian professionals in Agriculture, transnational cooperation with the Government of Britain, Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), African Union (AU), signing of an MoU with the University of Sussex for the development of tertiary education in Nigeria, partnership with the European Union (EU) on Research, Development and Innovation at Brussels among others; all aimed at articulating new strategies to reinforce existing efforts of the government at improving the standard of education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInternally, he is undertaking a holistic review of the operating procedures of the Fund, operationalized the zonal offices with delegated functions and set targets for all departments and standing Committees.\n\n\u201cFor example, the Book Development Committee which last published books in 2014 have been directed to publish at least 40 standards, peer-reviewed academic textbooks on diverse topics by 31st December 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Monitoring and Evaluation Department must complete site visits and process recommendations for tranche releases within 2 weeks of receipt of a request from institutions.\n\n\u201cStarting with ICT interventions, beneficiary institutions shall henceforth make submissions electronically (Online) to minimize human contact.\n\n\u201cStaff of the Fund were also requested to make sacrifices by forgoing certain privileges in response to the sharp drop in tax collections in 2021, with a promise that they will be restored when the situation improves.\n\n\u201cHe is also committed to the completion of ongoing projects rather than starting new ones, and has taken steps in that direction.\n\n\u201cHe interacted and secured the buy-in of Management and Staff of the Fund for the reforms, which have received widespread support from stakeholders.\n\n\u201cPerhaps more problematic are the Procurement and Project Management reforms introduced to eliminate corruption, reduce delivery time of projects, prevent cost escalation and improve general efficiency in the discharge of the Fund\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cUnder the new dispensation, all projects to be executed by the Fund are to be planned, packaged and selected by the beneficiary institutions for review and concurrence of the Fund. No more TETFund or vendor-promoted projects, as the needs of the institutions shall prevail.\n\n\u201cAnnual disbursement allocations were made directly to the beneficiary institutions at a public ceremony held at the National Universities Commission (NUC) on 9th May 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Vice-Chancellors, Provosts and Rectors were directed to advertise and procure their projects through open, competitive bidding to achieve value for money.\n\n\u201cThis was widely reported in the media and commended by the Procurement Professionals Association of Nigeria along with the threat to punish erring contractors who delay project execution or deliver poor quality jobs. Hardly the stuff of a wheeler and dealer.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore laughable that these measures are being described by some aggrieved vested interests as \u2018unwholesome practices\u2019.\n\n\u201cEqually instructive is the fact that TETFund is not a contract awarding agency on behalf of beneficiary institutions so the reference to contract splitting and padding are totally baseless and incomprehensible.\n\n\u201cThe design and costing of projects are done by the respective institutions. So also is the supervision and management. TETFund only monitors milestones attainments ahead of releases in tranches.\n\n\u201cTo allege that someone who publicly distributed allocation letters \u201cis in the habit of asking for advance payment in dollars before grants are given\u201d is standing truth on its head.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that since the resumption of duty, Arc Echono has not personally issued any grant or letter to any beneficiary institution but rather through technical departments responsible for each intervention area.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed cruel to insinuate that Vice Chancellors will be happy to meet the monetary demands without complaining, and the same Vice Chancellors will be instructed to award the contracts to anointed contractors.\n\n\u201cWhen people are consumed with evil and hate, logic departs. It is noteworthy that no institution or Vice Chancellor was cited to buttress or corroborate this callous claim. Is anybody hurting? Why?\n\n\u201cEqually curious is the allegation that Arc Echono has a list of anointed firms that execute TETFund projects, yet the author failed to mention even one of them for fear of rebuttal.\n\n\u201cIt was even asserted that his control of TETFund contracts preceded his appointment judging from the singular example of a twin lecture theatre in a University in Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSahara reporters should find the courage to mention the institution so that serious-minded investigative journalists can unearth the truth and debunk the fat lies.\n\n\u201cThe suspicion is that since 2022 allocations were only made recently in May and the projects are still being packaged and prepared by the institutions, it will be difficult to sustain any allegation under his recent tenure. Solution? Backdate the allegations.\n\n\u201cBrilliant though incomprehensible attempts were also made to make a link, as well as draw, parallels with an alleged phantom contract scam at NECO some years back.\n\n\u201cWhat Sahara reporters did not say is that those allegations were thoroughly investigated by five (5) different anti-corruption and regulatory agencies and not a single one of them even mentioned, let alone, associated Arc Echono with any allegation of wrongdoing or misdemeanour.\n\n\u201cIn fact, neither Arc Echono as Permanent Secretary nor the Federal Ministry of Education\u2019s Ministerial Tenders Board approved any contract for NECO throughout the period and not a single contractor with NECO was associated or linked to him in whatever form.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Arc Echono met and recognized Mr Ibrahim Peter Alih for the first and only time at Jalingo, Taraba State at the close of the 2021 National Council on Education Conference, more than one (1) year after the allegations were made. So much for relation (not even from the same State), front and tacit support.\n\n\u201cYet Sahara reporters chose to rubbish the reputation and character of an individual without an iota of evidence or proof.\n\n\u201cThe allegation of lobbying powerful Vice Chancellors to facilitate his appointment betrays further ignorance of how such appointments are made and does not merit further comment.\n\n\u201cIt is however unfortunate that the sacred duty of the fourth estate of the realm (media) to hold institutions and public officers accountable has been misappropriated for lucre and as a weapon for slander, libel and character assassination in this particular case.\n\n\u201cEqually tragic is the fact that a once credible and respected medium has reduced itself to a purveyor of falsehood and trash.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive that some of the measures introduced have led to stepping on many toes of individuals and firms whose services were considered not necessary, wasteful or lacking in value, and have had to be disengaged/discontinued.\n\n\u201cThe public may therefore expect further false allegations with maximum prejudice.\n\n\u201cWe seize this opportunity to reassure our stakeholders and the general public that TETFund is being run with a deep sense of responsibility,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Clement Mudiaga Enajemo: A Timeless Pan-African Fashion Czar and His Craft \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Clement Mudiaga Enajemo\u2019s intriguing creations evoke awe, transforming tangible and mundane materials into ethereal and dreamlike experiences for both the wearer and the admirer. His world is a twist of art and commerce. Making powerful statements on the elite fashion scene, \u2018Mudi\u2019 as he is fondly called, has redefined beauty and style. Adedayo Adejobi, in an encounter, captures his craft and how he makes fashion a tool for cultural emancipation.\n\nSince tastes vary across generations, it may be hard to decide who is the best among the best in the Nigerian fashion scene. But one name resonates speedily, Mudi- one of Nigeria\u2019s most iconic, unique genius and successful names in fashion.\n\nOver the past few years, Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, has emerged as an epicentre for fashion in Africa, and one of the busiest names to emerge from the scene, Clement Mudiaga Enajemo of Mudi Africa has played a major role in the country\u2019s evolving industry.\n\nFrom the prime of his life and humble beginning in a one-store Adebakin in Ikosi \u2013 Ketu outlet as dressmaker assistant to his world-class factory, showroom and Headquarters located on Mudi Lane in Anthony, Lagos, his works emphasise structure and purity of form. His other multiple upscale outlets across Abuja, Accra, Senegal, Nairobi, Ivory Coast, and South Africa; speak to Mudiaga\u2019s testament to hard work, dignity of labour and street sense, and grace to grace story which reads like a Netflix storyboard. Revered as the pinnacle of luxury and craftsmanship, Mudi uses the most ingenious fabrics and rigorous tailoring techniques to painstakingly construct and envelope the manly form with the flourish of couture.\n\nThe rain was coming down heavily last week Thursday when Mudi pulled to his courtyard, in a black Tundra truck clad in white three-quarter-length trousers and a gait that could stop any woman in her tracks. On exchanging pleasantries at the car park, he ushered this reporter into the big grey edifice. He was charming from the moment we sat down. His easy laughter emitted confidence. And yet Mudi is pleased to live within his creative contraption. It may be the thing that makes him able to create eclectic work: at his core, he is equally unafraid of failure and success.\n\nThe entrance to the Mudi headquarters, a viewing delight, has all the charm of a fascinating diversion whilst also connecting the viewer to Mudi\u2019s vision of personal transformation. An unmarked glass door gate welcomes you to a staircase, whose white plaster of Paris ceiling frames the all-white and lemon green, yet colourful walkway.\n\nStanding at about five foot five inches usually gives little away to strangers, but having known and kept tabs on him over the years, he is always ready to open out of his enigma. Some designers are trend seekers, but Mudi is the trend, season after season, leaving others spinning at his heels as he unfolds his remarkable vision of what an African man can be.\n\nHaving enjoyed longevity with more than three decades in the business, he\u2019s known to many as the pinnacle of luxury and craftsmanship in Nigeria. Mudi uses the most ingenious fabrics and rigorous tailoring techniques to painstakingly construct and envelope the manly form with the flourish of couture. True to type, the celebrity clothier has evolved over the years into a cultural icon of some sort with his works worn by the top echelon of society, cutting across all walks of life.\n\nHaving stayed long in business reinventing the wheel, it was on my mind to ask him the same question he had been asked repeatedly: \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d For the designer, the secret may lie in how he connects to the spirit of all age brackets: he is a curious conservative mortal with a brilliant instinct for modern desire and a designer not afraid to reach into what makes people human, asking odd questions, then coming back with very elegant answers.\n\nWith a radical shift in fashion trends and the outcry to reclaim our lost African identity and heritage, Nigerians at home and abroad, and Africans, have come to appreciate, patronize and wear purely Nigerian brands. Ahead of his peers in the fashion space, Mudi no doubt originated and has been at the forefront of smart wearable art for corporate and social functions, using the same fashion as a tool for the cultural expression of the Nigerian social identity.\n\nAccording to the culturally aware craftsman, \u2018\u2018gone are the days we wore African fabrics during traditional ceremonies and/or cultural festivals only. Nigerians and the rest of Africa have become awake to, and reclaim our African identity. For over twenty years, I have and counting, I have through my designs, shown that wearing traditional attires patterns and prints can be fashionable among the old and young; for casual and corporate functions as well. If you look at our people, they have become so fashion aware and they stand out representing an emancipated social African identity so much so our European and Asian brothers have taken to our fashion, style and dress sense. I love Nigeria and Africa and so I design with Africa in mind\u2019\u2019\n\nAsides from his love for exquisite fabrics, one thing Mudi would spend his hard-earned sweat on are vintage cars, paintings and tasteful interior accessories. As an extension of his love for fashion, he acquires vintage cars like the 1957 Mercedes Benz 290 series, and the 1955 Peugeot 404 series, five years older than Nigeria. The designer who founded his eponymous label in 1993 with a view to recontextualising Nigeria\u2019s maximal aesthetic rich design heritage in a fresh new way is not shy about his love for them.\n\nFor a man who has over the years, proven himself adept not only at scale but also at sensuality, with a firm understanding of how to make the Nigerian man feel his best, these words bare the core of what you might call his inspiration, \u201cI wanted to put forward a bolder mix, combining the excess Nigeria has to offer\u2014from exquisite handwork to vibrant colours\u2014with clean tailoring and a minimal aesthetic. I am always trying new materials, colour combinations, and altered approaches to age-old techniques. I enjoy putting a collection together mixing the traditional and contemporary, minimal and maximal. Each combination speaks differently,\u201d Enajemo enthused.\n\nFor him, luxury must be comfortable, otherwise, it is not luxury. He\u2019s one interesting and creative African designer with Nigerian roots who has conquered hearts, pockets and his place in the fashion world. No wonder he\u2019s the darling of the celebrity world, thus yielding endorsements from top Nigerian and African politicians and businessmen who have endorsed his collection of clothes.\n\nMudi\u2019s sensual, irreverent style continually challenges creativity, by embracing the freedom of masculine sexuality. His style is known to challenge standard views of fashion. Although he wasn\u2019t born into an aristocratic family, his life has mirrored the mantra, \u2018\u2018dignity in labour and days of little beginnings.\u201d\n\nFew designers can reference their own archives deftly and do so without it looking like they\u2019ve run out of ideas. For the last two decades, Mudi\u2019s institution dedicated to contemporary art and culture has continually questioned perceptions and challenged intentions through an evolution of projects.\n\nThis writer could not help but notice some of his most recent collection, particularly some vintage 1950\u2019s jacquard fabrics, embroidered and bow embellishments on nipped-waist kaftans, knee-length shirts and masculine tops. For the Fashion Czar, \u2018\u2018intuition is a strong masculine quality and I have managed to apply that instinct to my career. The idea of seeing everybody clad in the same outfit is not really my thing.\u201d\n\nWorking on a 2023 avant-garde collection set to be unveiled later in the year, Mudi\u2019s work is colourful, airy, and fun and he does not shy away from creativity in the service of self-expression.",

          "text": "*Says former VP ill-prepared to be Nigeria\u2019s president\n\n*I dare you to appear for TV interview, Atiku replies APC\u2019s candidate\n\n*You are seventh-time aspirant, Obi\u2019s group mocks former VP\n\n*Wike: I will speak about Atiku soon\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nThe presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, yesterday responded to the fireworks by his counterpart in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, accusing the presidential candidate of the main opposition party of offering him a vice presidential ticket in 2007.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on ARISE NEWS Channel on Friday, Atiku had stated that he rejected Tinubu\u2019s request to be his running mate on the platform of the Action Congress (AC) in 2007 because of his aversion to a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\n\nAtiku stated that his refusal to accede to Tinubu\u2019s request made the former Lagos State governor switch his support to the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who was the presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\nBut in a swift reaction by Tinubu\u2019s media aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, the APC presidential candidate stated that it was Atiku that offered him the vice presidential ticket in 2007.\n\n\n\nTinubu Campaign Council (TCO) has also reacted to Atiku\u2019s claim, saying that the former vice president was ill-prepared to be the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nHowever, Atiku has challenged the APC presidential candidate to subject himself to a one-hour interview, like he did, to test if he will be able to be as articulate and mentally present as him (Atiku).\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Rivers State governor, Mr Nyesom Wike has disclosed that he would soon speak about the former vice president and the recent events in the PDP.\n\n\n\nIn the statement by Tinubu\u2019s media aide, the APC presidential candidate disclosed that the former vice president knew nothing about the formation of AC at the time, adding that after he clinched the presidential ticket, he offered him the vice presidential slot.\n\nHe said Atiku in his desperate attempt to win the presidential election by stoking religious bias reduced himself to uttering baseless lies on national television.\n\n\u201cAtiku may want to be president. However, all he has shown is that he is a pathological liar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever moral compass he had has been lost. During a 22 July television interview, Atiku assaulted historic truth by lying that he did not name Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the Action Congress ticket because Atiku did not want a Muslim as his running mate.\u201d\n\nTinubu disclosed that the actual founders of the AC offered the party\u2019s flag to Atiku.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for dear old Atiku. Love of his ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge. When President Obasanjo virtually exiled him from the PDP, we lent him our support by giving him the AC platform for the 2007 election.\n\n\u201cLet me say openly that Atiku offered me the vice presidential ticket in 2007. Let me also say that my religion has not changed. When he offered the position to me, I was a Muslim and I believe he was aware of my religious faith at the time.\n\n\u201cAtiku\u2019s calculations and deceit had nothing to do with religion or his sensitivity to it. His conduct has everything to do with what we discovered about his paucity of character and love of intrigue,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nTinubu alleged that 15 years later, Atiku promised the Governor of Rivers State, Mr Nyesom Wike the same vice presidential ticket and also reneged.\n\n\u201cAtiku has no business raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket except as a hypocrite. Perhaps he believes people have forgotten his antics during the 1993 election. After he woefully lost his bid to be the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, what did he do? He canvassed and lobbied harder than anyone to become the running mate to late Chief MKO Abiola. When it benefitted him personally, Atiku did not see anything wrong with a Muslim-Muslim ticket. He saw everything right in such a ticket as long as he was on it.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, Atiku criticises my selection as running mate based on religion. He does so because he cannot criticise it on other grounds,\u201d Tinubu added.\n\nAlso in a separate reaction by the TCO, the Director of Media and Communication of the organisation, Mr Bayo Onanuga, said it was most shocking that Atiku admitted that he cheated the system for decades and engaged in gross misconduct as a government worker.\n\nTCO added that as a customs officer at the Idi-Iroko border, Atiku revealed that he ran a commercial taxi service, claiming \u201cthere is no law stopping public officers from doing business in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\n\nTinubu Campaign Organisation argued that every officer in the civil service is expected to comply with a code of conduct and service rules which bar civil and public servants from engaging in private business while in government employment to the detriment of the service he/she is employed to render to the public.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIt is our considered view that Atiku gamed the system all through his career in public service, culminating in his founding of Intel Logistics along with the late Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and some Italians, even while he was still in the employment of the Nigeria Customs Service.\n\nTCO said it was also surprising that the PDP presidential candidate does not know the contribution of the oil and gas industry to Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nI Dare You to Appear for an Interview, Atiku Replies Tinubu\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku through his media adviser, Mr Paul Ibe has challenged Tinubu to a prolonged interview, saying that the APC presidential candidate has not sat down for any prolonged interview due to some obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cNigerians have seen him talk in public and can themselves gauge the reason why he is mortified to do so,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe statement added that the Tinubu Campaign Organisation exposed its gross desperation by citing the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) 1999, to declare Atiku\u2019s stance on engaging in a side business while he was a young customs officer as a breach of the law.\n\nIt reminded TCO that Nigeria is not under a military regime, adding that the Constitution is not retroactive.\n\nThe statement accused the TCO of betraying either dishonesty or lack of attention to detail by claiming that Atiku said oil contributed 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a lie. What the Waziri said is as follows: Oil only maybe accounts for about 20 per cent of our GDP. The use of the word maybe by the Waziri was in reflection of the different figures given. While the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics states a figure close to 10 per cent, other multilateral organisations have given a much higher figure of between 15-20 per cent,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement further disclosed that Atiku has an earned Masters degree from Anglia Ruskin University, and challenged any of the present presidential candidates to present an equal or higher degree.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we would like to challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour-long interview, as the Waziri did, and if he can be as articulate and mentally present as our candidate, then he can talk. Until then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\nAlso reacting to Atiku\u2019s scathing comments against the presidential candidate of Labour Party in the 2023 election, Mr Peter Obi, the Peter Obi Support Network (POSN), yesterday mocked the former vice president, describing him as \u201cseventh-time presidential aspirant.\u201d\n\nAtiku had said during the interview that Obi could not win the 2023 presidential election because the Labour Party did not have any governor and National Assembly members elected on its platform.\n\n\n\nBut the POSN in a statement by its spokesperson, Sani Altukry, titled, \u2018Atiku Abubakar takes Nigerian masses for granted\u2019, said Atiku in the \u201crecorded interview,\u201d gave unsolicited and erroneous political consultancy on who could win elections and who could not win.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe seventh-time presidential aspirant reportedly claimed that today\u2019s most popular presidential candidate, Peter Obi, cannot.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the former vice president based his entire permutation on the assumed influence of corruption promoting and vote-buying mercenaries euphemistically called political structure, and failed to consider the unassailable powers of the masses of Nigeria, who are the most powerful force in a democracy and the key determinants of election victory.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs every political philosopher knows, sovereignty resides with the people. Alhaji Atiku Abubakar\u2019s assertion speaks to the illusions of the fascist school of thought that believes that the masses do not matter and erroneously believes that the masses cannot think for themselves.\n\n\u201cIn essence, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is saying that Nigerians are some kind of slaves who cannot take a political decision on their own, except as imposed on them by their slave masters,\u201d POSN explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis erroneous idea belongs to the past, and so we assure the former vice president and those of his class who hold such derogatory perception of Nigerians that a new Nigeria is here and Nigerians are ready to take their destiny into their own hands,\u201d POSN added.\n\nAlso reacting to Atiku\u2019s interview on ARISE NEWS Channel, the Rivers State governor, Wike, in a statement by his Special Assistant Media, Mr Kelvin Ebiri, said he would soon speak and reveal to Nigerians all that has transpired in the PDP since the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cOn Atiku, I will speak soon and Nigerians will know the actual truth of all that has transpired in the PDP in recent times,\u201d Wike said.",

          "text": "* Bill is draconian, imperialistic, say Niger Delta leaders\n\n*FG wants to deprive indigenous people of their lands, Afenifere alleges\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) have kicked against the recent reintroduction of the widely-rejected Water Resources Bill in the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Water Resources, Mr Suleiman Adamu and a clique of lawmakers at the National Assembly have been desperately pushing for the passage of the bill which was rejected by the eighth National Assembly following public outcry.\n\n\n\nTheir relentless campaign to ensure the passage of the bill has fuelled speculations that they have ulterior motives.\n\nOne of the offensive provisions in the bill is that while there is popular agitation for resource control and devolution of powers to the states and local governments, the bill seeks to compel Nigerians to permit and pay tax to the federal government like oil and gas operators before they drill boreholes at the backyards.\n\nThe bill also seeks to cede ownership of waterways, Benue Valley and river banks to the federal government apparently for the resettlement of foreign herdsmen.\n\n\n\nAfter the bill was rejected by the eighth National Assembly, it was recently reintroduced in the ninth House of Representatives.\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom had described its \u201creintroduction as \u201cevil\u201d and part of the agenda of the federal government to seize land from the 36 states of the federation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to urge Benue indigenes to rise and reject the bill because it is targeted at our ancestral heritage. In their attempt to take over our inheritance they came with Ruga and a cattle colony among others. But the people behind this plot can rest assured that Benue will resist any attempt to take over our land and water resources through any guise.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bill is an evil bill by the federal government to take over the river banks and allow herdsmen from other parts of Africa to take over the Benue Valley.\n\n\n\nAlso reacting, the PANDEF, through its spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, told THISDAY at the weekend that it would continue to reject the bill, which it described as an obnoxious, draconian, imperialistic and unnecessary evil.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Niger Delta region, particularly of the South-south geopolitical zone had rejected the Water Resources Bill from the beginning, and our position has not changed; it remains rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat bill is not only obnoxious but draconic and imperialistic. It is an unnecessary evil. That was why it attracted wild condemnation when it was first introduced. The eighth National Assembly heeded the voice of the people, by throwing it out. It was likewise stepped down when it was reintroduced in this ninth National Assembly in 2020, following similar denunciation by citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, troubling that the Bill has again been introduced in the House of Representatives, more so, with less than a year to the end of the session of this National Assembly. The questions we would want the sponsors of the Bill to answer are; why the insistence on this Bill? Whose interest are they trying to satisfy?\u201d PANDEF queried.\n\n\n\nIt said it was most absurd and callous that in the face of increased clamour for the devolution of powers to the federating units, the federal government was plotting to accrue further powers to itself through this abhorrent bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo we need to further apprise that our oil and gas resources have been plundered, over the years, by the federal government and its agents; our hitherto luxurious ecosystem has been decimated and basic means of livelihood destroyed, with little or nothing to show, in terms of the development of our communities and improvements in the living conditions of the people? Yet, they now want to control our water resources; the people of the Niger Delta Region say a big no to it,\u201d PANDEF added.\n\n\n\nThe Niger Delta leaders urged the members of the House of Representatives and Senators not to allow themselves to be used by self-seeking officials and groups to secure legislation that would exacerbate the tension and crisis in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe caution, in particular, the federal lawmakers of South-south extraction, and indeed, of the entire Southern and Middle Belt regions not to support a bill that is anti-peace, dangerous and that could destroy the fragile unity of this country,\u201d PANDEF said.\n\nPANDEF also described the claim by the sponsors of the bill that southern governors are now in support of the bill as illusory and preposterous, adding that such a claim should be discarded.\n\n\n\nOn its part, Afenifere has also kicked against the reintroduction of the bill at the National Assembly.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Comrade Jare Ajayi, told THISDAY in Ibadan, Oyo State capital that the bill was another way of bringing RUGA through the back door, describing it as unacceptable.\n\nAccording to him, the reintroduction of the bill was to deprive the indigenous people of their land, insisting that this is not in the best interest of the ethnic nationalities.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThe reintroduction of the Water Resources Bill is unacceptable to Afenifere; this is because it is another way of depriving the indigenous people of their land and this is not in the best interest of the various ethnic nationalities given the experience with the federal government.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo has also condemned the bill, describing it as completely obnoxious.\n\n\n\nThe organisation\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Dr Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia told THISDAY that the bill is completely at variance with present national realities.\n\n\u201cAt a time we are canvassing for devolution of powers to states and local government areas, some people are still toying with the idea of controlling river banks and all that. It\u2019s so sad.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but another RUGA. The same way we resisted the bill the last time, we are even more resolute now. It is unacceptable and totally out of tune with realities,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nHe further asked the governors and members of the National Assembly from the South-east to completely resist and reject the said bill.\n\n\u201cOur position is clear and has not changed. We say no to the bill and we are urging our governors and federal lawmakers to also reject it. Apart from the South-east, political leaders from the South-west, South-south and North-central should also reject this obnoxious bill,\u201d the organisation insisted.",

          "text": "*Sylva proposes multi-pronged approach to tackle crude oil theft\n\n*Port Harcourt to begin refining of 60,000bpd in 2023\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe European Union (EU) has intensified pressure on Nigeria to supply gas to Europe as it attempts to wean itself off Russian gas on the back of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war with Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, at the weekend suggested a multi-faceted approach to resolving the massive oil theft, vandalism and outright sabotage of Nigeria\u2019s oil facilities which have combined to hobble Nigeria\u2019s ability to meet its crude production quota.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Sylva by yet another delegation from Europe led by the Deputy Director General, EU Energy Platform Task Force, Mr Mathew Baldwin, the leader of the delegation, reiterated the EU\u2019s commitment to making the ongoing gas projects a reality.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to be working with you in a big way\u2026the more the security situation can be improved in the Niger Delta region, the more investment we will see,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe stated that the visit was part of an effort to establish a new sustainable partnership and renewed investment drive with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of supporting such efforts. The more there are improved investments in the Niger-Delta and the minister is leading in this direction, the more the investments will come in\u201d, he restated.\n\n\n\nA major area of collaboration, the parties agreed on is the ongoing Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Project and the Trans Sahara Gas Pipelines (TSGP) project regarded as one of the world\u2019s longest offshore pipelines and is expected to transport gas from Nigeria through Morocco to Europe.\n\nDespite its intention to raise gas supply, Nigeria has been unable to do so as a result of declining funding, attacks on upstream facilities and theft of petroleum products.\n\n\n\nBut Sylva while speaking during a visit by the delegation from Europe, advocated the deployment of technology, security forces, community collaboration and increased government action to halt the menace.\n\nIt would be one of the several visits in the last few months to Nigerian authorities, including the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) by officials from Europe.\n\n\n\nThe minister called for collaboration with the EU in the areas of security, technology deployment, project financing and more private sector participation to meet the country\u2019s plan of stepping into the void created by the aftermath of the Russian-Ukraine altercation.\n\nHe frowned on the decision by the EU and Western nations to withdraw investment in fossil fuels, insisting that hydrocarbons will continue to be relevant while gas would be used as a transition fuel in the coming years.\n\n\n\nSylva, therefore, appealed to the delegation to impress upon their businessmen and financial institutions to debottleneck the process of obtaining loans and other sources of funding to ramp up the exploration of oil and gas.\n\nThe minister recalled that the delegation was earlier in the Niger Delta to see for themselves the situation, assuring that the region would be secured for oil and gas investments to continue to thrive while the country\u2019s production quota would be raised.\n\n\u201cSecurity is one area of cooperation with the EU. They went to the Niger Delta to see the security situation for themselves. Part of the solution is technology deployment.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always advocated for collaboration in this regard. We have to have a four-legged approach. We have to have the government, security agencies and communities working together. We also need to have the technology. We\u2019re discussing with the EU how we can collaborate on developing technology.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of gas projects like the Trans-Saharan gas pipeline and so on and we need the environment to be conducive to achieve all this. The project will deliver gas to Europe in a few years to come,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nThe minister assured the EU delegation of the federal government\u2019s commitment to deepening investment in gas since it had been adopted as Nigeria\u2019s energy transition fuel and expressed confidence that the EU had given a lot of commitment in that regard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re together on the same page with the rest of the world in using gas as the energy transition fuel. We\u2019re working together in technology development and financing.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s the private sector that invests but the EU is responsible for policy direction and they have shown a lot of commitments. We\u2019ve been having discussions. This is not the first and won\u2019t be the last. it\u2019s a good beginning for us,\u201d the minister explained.\n\nPort Harcourt to Begin Refining of 60,000bpd in 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the Managing Director of the Port Harcourt Refining Company Limited, Mr Ahmed Dikko, has assured that the rehabilitation of the old Port Harcourt Refinery with a refining capacity of 60,000 barrels per day will be completed and put to use by the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHe gave the assurance when the House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on the state of the country\u2019s refineries visited the facility in Rivers State for an on-the-spot assessment of the $1.5 billion rehabilitation project of the facility.\n\n\n\nDikko said the old Port Harcourt refinery, referred to as Area Five, would be the first of three phases of the project.\n\nHe said by the time the entire project is completed by the end of 2024, the facility would have a refining capacity of 210 bpd.\n\nDikko expressed confidence that they would stick to the timelines and within the cost approved for the project.\n\nHe said despite costing more, some of the equipment required for the rehabilitation had to be air freighted to ensure that they stick as much as possible to the schedule that they have.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe plan to finish Area 5 by the first quarter of next year, so we can begin to run it. It is the old refinery. It is a 60, 000 barrels per day capacity plant and it is a priority for us at this point. The other parts of the refinery would come a few months after that.\n\n\u201cWe are on track and managing the process very well and would continue to do the best we can at all times to ensure that we meet these expectations we put on ourselves so we all would be proud of all these activities and begin to have some refining capacity in Port Harcourt,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives for their support.\n\nChairman of the House Ad-Hoc Committee, Hon. Ganiyu Johnson, who was conducted around the facility along with his members by the MD expressed satisfaction with the level of work.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far on behalf of my committee members, we are satisfied with the level of work because we did not expect this level of performance when we left Abuja. But after going round we are satisfied with the level of performance.\n\n\u201cNigerians should bear with the company. We know that the solution to all oil subsidies is refineries. The oil subsidy would be a thing of the past. We should be able to reduce it to the barest minimum.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe owe Nigerians the duty to ensure this place is working. Because if these refineries are not working, we would continue to suffer and God forbid we hope it would not get to a stage an average man cannot buy fuel and that is why we want to encourage you and support you and make sure you complete this refinery. Even if it is just Port Harcourt for now, it means we would be able to deliver 210, 000 bpd.\u201d\n\nHe urged the MD to fast-track the completion of the refinery and make sure it is delivered on schedule.",

          "title": "The peculiarities of the presidential poll",
          "text": "A friend, who is a pastor, chatted me up on WhatsApp recently. We often discuss Nigerian politics. When he buzzed, I knew it was time for another session in view of the prevailing circumstances. \u201cWho are we voting for o\u2026 been looking forward to your analysis,\u201d he asked. Of course, I do not endorse candidates. No matter the soft spot I have for them, I do not say \u201cthis is the candidate to vote for\u201d. I prefer to analyse them, list their good and bad sides and let the readers judge. When people seek my opinion, I always try to make them pipe down on their enthusiasm that a messiah is in town. Nigeria\u2019s problems will not disappear overnight. The direction of leadership is the key thing.\n\nAfter chatting back and forth on each of the top presidential candidates and how we think the elections would go, my friend and I concluded that a credible election will be more imperative than ever. I expressed faith in the ability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), under the leadership of Prof Yakubu Mahmoud, to deliver the goods. My friend then fired a parting shot: \u201cThis election\u2019s throwing us into a rare situation. Muslim-Muslim ticket. Igbo presidency. Power remaining in the north. Either of tribal or religious sentiments will have to give way for the other.\u201d I was wowed! \u201cI didn\u2019t even see things this way,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve just inspired an article in me.\u201d\n\nThere is a sense in which we can say every election in the fourth republic comes with its peculiarities and 2023 would not be an exception. In 1999, we had two candidates of the same ethnic stock and religion on the ballot \u2014 Olusegun Obasanjo and Olu Falae. In 2003, we had the first election to be organised by a sitting government and many feared it would end the way the 1964 and 1983 elections did \u2014 in chaos, ultimately leading to the termination of democratic rule. Our democracy survived the sad predictions. In 2007, we had the transfer of power from one elected president to another \u2014 the first in our history. The elections were a sham but we managed to survive.\n\nIn 2011, we elected the first president from a southern ethnic minority but he had to ward off a strong northern challenge from within and without his party. It was also noteworthy because the entire southern states, minus one, voted in one direction, coupled with support from seven northern states, to defeat a candidate from one of the major ethnic groups. In 2015, we recorded perhaps the biggest landmark so far \u2014 an incumbent being defeated by the opposition candidate and conceding the election before the final results were officially announced. In 2019, the novelty was not that much, just that an incumbent retained power for the second time since 1999. Small statistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs my friend noted, 2023 may be the most significant yet. There are more that the regular two major candidates. We now have four: Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), and Alhaji Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). If Atiku or Kwankwaso wins, that means power will be in the north for 12 years non-stop. If Tinubu wins and is inaugurated, a Muslim-Muslim presidency will be a first. It nearly happened in 1993. And if Obi wins, he will become the first elected president from the south-east. Another sensational novelty.\n\nAtiku, unlike Tinubu, does not have any issues with religious balancing \u2014 he is a northern Muslim and expectedly picked a southern Christian as his running mate. But a peculiarity, or novelty, is also on the horizon. By May 29, 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari, a northerner, will have spent eight years in office. Conventional wisdom is that power should move to the south after that. However, Atiku, who harbours a lifelong ambition to be president, was backed by the \u201celders\u201d of the PDP to win the party\u2019s presidential ticket. In this fourth republic, Atiku has always participated in the presidential race since 2007 irrespective of where the position is zoned. This is nothing new to him.\n\nAlthough southerners might be calculating that if Atiku wins, power will be in the north for 12 to 16 years non-stop, his calculation is different: that the PDP has only produced one northerner, Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, as president. Yar\u2019Adua fell terminally ill and died before his third anniversary in office. Therefore, Atiku would argue, the 16 years of PDP in power was overly dominated by southerners and it is only fair for a northerner in the party to finally get it. He has always argued, openly, that national unity is not a function of what region produces the president but the way the president handles matters of equity and fairness in office. He has promised to be fair to all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe that the PDP decided to go north for practical purposes. That is the only advantage it can gain in the race. The assumption before the primaries was that APC was going to pick a southerner. If PDP had also picked a southerner, the field would be wide open to APC in the north where it controls 14 of the 19 states. By going north, PDP would hope to get northerners to prefer a fellow northerner to a southerner. PDP can also hope to enjoy the fallouts from the Muslim-Muslim ticket in the south and the Christian north. If Atiku wins, there will be novelties to it: the first time power would stay beyond eight years in a region and the first president to be elected from the north-east.\n\nFor those who are religiously sensitive when it comes to politics, a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-no, and this is one battle Tinubu will have to fight \u2014 and win \u2014 if he is to actualise his presidential ambition. The peculiarities of Nigerian politics, as I have pointed out in the past, are evident in the dilemma. It is usually thought that a southern presidential candidate must be Christian and a northern one must be Muslim. Since we like to do balancing, we always prefer a Muslim-Christian match and a north-south pairing. If this understanding holds forever, a northern Christian will struggle hard to be president or vice-president and a southern Muslim will find it very hard as well.\n\nWith Tinubu, a southern Muslim, as the APC presidential candidate, he was faced with a dilemma in choosing a running mate. It had to be a northerner, no questions about that. But should it be a Muslim or a Christian? That was the question. The north is predominantly Muslim, plus Tinubu will be up against Atiku, a \u201chomeboy\u201d in the region. I guess Tinubu did his calculations and decided that he would stand a better chance up north with a Muslim-Muslim ticket \u2014 with the hope that he would also win convincingly in his south-west base and put up a decent showing in the south-south. It is a big gamble, I would say, but some political analysts were expecting this scenario all along.\n\nTinubu probably calculated that those who would vote for him would still do so irrespective of the faith of his vice-presidential candidate and those who would not vote for him would not change their minds even if he picked someone of a different faith. It is possible he reasoned that many of those opposed to the Muslim-Muslim pairing even before he picked Ahaji Kashim Shettima are known to be opposed to the APC. In the final analysis, nonetheless, if Tinubu wins with a Muslim-Muslim ticket, a major jinx will have been broken and political balancing at the national level may experience a re-engineering. After all, this is how precedents are set. We eagerly await how it will pan out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Obi wins, that, in my opinion, will be the biggest landmark. Virtually everything about it would be novel. That would be the first time a party without a state under its control would win the presidential election. It would be the first time a party without control of the national assembly would produce the president. Above all, it would be the first time an Igbo would be elected president. The icing on the cake, of course, would be that an Igbo is elected president without \u201czoning\u201d. Before the presidential primaries, Igbo leaders were asking the APC and PDP to concede their presidential slots to the south-east. Achieving this without zoning would be extraordinary.\n\nObi\u2019s candidacy is, as it were, accidental. He wanted to contest for PDP\u2019s ticket. With the signals not looking bright for him, and with the possibility of being picked as the vice-presidential candidate not looking good either, he defected to LP. Before you knew what was happening, his popularity caught fire on Twitter as he was branded the \u201cfrugal\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d president Nigeria needs. Soon enough, his Twitter popularity started translating to tangible support on the streets, so much so the notion of him being anyone\u2019s running mate was no longer something to be contemplated. Although much of his Twitter base is considered ill-mannered and foul-mouthed, I believe it is working well for him.\n\nMany things are aligning for Obi: the home support in the south-east, the passion of the youthful #EndSARS movement, and the displeasure in sections of Christendom over the choices of the other parties. Plus he is the new symbol of those searching for \u201cchange\u201d. Buhari was the symbol in 2015. Obi\u2019s strength outside the south is not considered significant enough to turn the table, but he can also make use of the relatively long period between now and the February 2023 presidential election to widen and deepen his base. If he wins, it will be one of the most momentous developments in our politics since 1960, ranking almost side-by-side with the defeat of a sitting president in 2015.\n\nWe have quite an election in our hands. It will be the third president-to-president transition via the ballot, thereby consolidating our democratic experience. Beyond that, the election will challenge some received wisdoms. Will the voters choose to have power retained in the north \u2014 in spite of the power rotation understanding? Will they vote for a Muslim-Muslim ticket \u2014 overlooking lack of religious balancing? Or will someone from the south-east finally break the jinx by winning organically \u2014 proving that zoning is overrated? No matter who wins, something unusual is bound to happen next year. INEC and security agencies must put in their utmost best to help us make history. Epic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nLIFE AND DEBT\n\nWe have finally done it! We are now spending more than we earn to service our debts. Imagine you earn N1 million and pay N1.2 million as interests on your debts! When we were told last year that we were spending 95 percent of our revenue to service debts, I joked: \u201cWe will soon start borrowing to pay our debts.\u201d Sometimes, I crack jokes that I feel are outlandish and impossible. Now it has happened. The Budget Office released the data on Thursday. We earned N1.63 trillion between January and April 2022 and serviced our debts with N1.94 trillion. We effectively borrowed N310 billion to pay the debts. And fuel subsidy will cost more than N4 trillion in 2022 alone. Wonderful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSUBSIDY JEOPARDY\n\nFederal government has projected to spend N6.7 trillion on petrol subsidy in 2023, according to Mrs Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance. The subsidy budget for this year is N4 trillion, although it looks likely to surpass that except Russia decides to end its campaign in Ukraine. There are plausible economic arguments about why it does not make sense to spend that kind on money on subsiding petrol consumption, notably the thinking that N4 trillion pumped into health and education sectors will be more beneficial to Nigerians. That is a good argument, but my worry today is that Nigerians are already buying petrol above the subsidised N165/litre. That is double jeopardy. Short-changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVARSITY TRAVESTY\n\nAre we about to see an end to the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU)? Since the latest action started on February 14, 2022, also known as Valentine\u2019s Day, there has been no love lost between the government and the university teachers. I grew up hearing of ASUU strikes. I experienced a couple myself while I was in the university. Whatever the federal government and ASUU resolve now will be temporary, from experience. There will be another ASUU strike next year and the year after that. Until we address the regressive structural and ideological issues with public university management system in Nigeria, strikes will continue to be an annual event. Foundational.\n\n\u2018FAKE BISHOPS\u2019\n\nThe criticism of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for picking a fellow Muslim as running mate is obviously getting to his handlers or camp. That is the only way I can explain the spectacle of the \u201cChristian clerics\u201d that flooded the unveiling of Alhaji Kashim Shettima as the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja on Wednesday. Please correct me if I am wrong: I have never seen clerics attend the unveiling of a presidential or vice-presidential candidate before. This is ridiculous. Whoever came up with this silly stunt should get a befitting knock on the forehead. I am sure those who will not vote for Tinubu will not change their minds, bishop or no bishop. Pointless.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Nigeria to the UK with the Global Talent Visa",
          "text": "Japa (verb, /d\u0292a pa/, Nigeria): to leave one\u2019s home country in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhen writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In 2020, the UK instituted the Global Talent Visa which allows leaders or potential leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology, to work in the UK for up to 5 years, without a sponsor or a job offer.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Adedeji to TechCabal in an interview. \u201cFrom start to finish, the whole process probably took about 2 months. And from an application perspective, I was most surprised about how effective it was.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 surprise was that a 5-year residence visa existed for writers. \u201cVisas like these are usually reserved for STEM careers or even tech professionals. Writers and poets like me usually focus on fellowships or masters\u2019 degrees,\u201d he commented in a Twitter Space he and Adedeji held earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 own application process, from submission to approval, took a total of 2 weeks, but he\u2019d taken 5 months to plan, and the only major delays he experienced were with his medical tests.\n\nOpe Adedeji, managing editor at Paystack\n\nAdedeji and Jones are just 2 out of many Nigerians who have taken advantage of the Global Talent Visa to leave their home countries to work abroad. In fact, Nigeria ranked third for the total number of applications processed for the visa in 2021 while South Africa ranked 10th.\n\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\n\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional Promise\n\nThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\n\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\n\nPeople who apply under Exceptional Talent are established leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology. They have won prestigious awards, appeared in notable publications, and have many years of experience under their belt.\n\nApplicants under Exceptional Promise have a record of outstanding work in their field over a 5-year period. They are intentional about developing outstanding international track records.\n\nEach of the 6 endorsing bodies has its own requirements for the Exceptional Talent and Exceptional Promise, and you can check them out here.\n\nAdedeji and Jones, both of whom have glowing track records of excellence in writing, applied for the visa under Exceptional Promise for arts and culture, which is open to creatives with careers in literature, dance, architecture, fashion design, film, and animation. The documents they needed were basic: passports, tuberculosis test results, and more importantly, 3 recommendation letters from organisations and people established in their fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been published in quite a number of notable magazines and publications over the years, and I also had a few literary awards to my name. I\u2019d also been a speaker at some literary festivals, so all I had to do was gather these in a document and submit it to the Arts Council,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nChika Jones, poet and digital marketing manager\n\nWhen she first heard of the visa, Adedeji, who is also managing editor at Paystack, had thought endorsement would be the most difficult part of the application process. \u201cI was sceptical at first because I thought I probably didn\u2019t qualify. After reading a bit more and speaking to people who\u2019d already gotten the visa, I realised I had a chance, and I took it.\u201d\n\nAdedeji mentioned that she collated links to her appearances and awards, her published stories, and news mentions in a Google Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took,\u201d she said.\n\nJones concurred, adding that the process is less stressful than people think it is. \u201cVisas are notoriously difficult to get, and so people don\u2019t even try. But with this, it wasn\u2019t as mind-numbing as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe UK Global Talent Visa website states that endorsement takes about 4 weeks, but both writers got their arts and culture endorsements within 2 weeks.\n\nFunfere Koroye, a design engineer whom TechCabal interviewed for an earlier episode of Digital Nomads, applied under Exceptional Talent. His route was a bit different from Adedeji\u2019s and Jones\u2019. While the creators had to apply to the Arts Council England, the endorsing body for arts and culture, Koroye had to apply to Tech Nation, the endorsing body for digital technology.\n\nUnder the digital technology option, people with technical and business skills can apply for endorsement.\n\nThe careers eligible for the digital technology Talent Visa\n\nKoroye already had over 8 years of experience building and designing products, and even building a startup, NuPay Technologies. All he had to do was dust up his resume, gather the links to sites like Figma and GitHub which highlighted his projects, and submit them to Tech Nation. Koroye\u2019s application was so successful he was also invited to become an ambassador for Tech Nation. \u201cMy job as an ambassador is to create more awareness about the visa,\u201d Koroye said. \u201cAcross Africa, not a lot of people know about the visa, so I\u2019m here to spread awareness and give people information about their applications.\u201d\n\nAfter getting endorsed, all the professionals had to do was get their tuberculosis test results, schedule a date for biometric capturing, and submit their applications. Adedeji, who had already been living in the UK for her masters\u2019 at the time, did not have to get a tuberculosis test or buy a ticket.\n\n\u201cMy process took 5 months because it was difficult to get my tuberculosis test, but that was the only stressful part. Everything else was pretty smooth,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAnd the best part\u2026\n\nThe whole process costs about \u00a32,000, said Jones who applied with and moved with his wife.\n\nTotal amount Chika Jones spent applying for the UK Global Talent Visa\n\n\u201cBut it can be more expensive, depending on how many years you apply for, and how you\u2019re moving.\u201d The visa itself costs \u00a3623\u2014\u00a3456 for endorsement and \u00a3167 for the visa application itself. You\u2019ll also have to pay \u00a3624 per year for every year you plan to spend in the UK for up to 5 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, the costs for endorsement, health insurance and biometrics all added up to about \u00a33,500,\u201d said Adedeji.\n\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round. The visa only requires awardees to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every year they have applied for; the rest of the time can be spent in any country of their choosing. \u201cIt just opens you up to a more expansive world,\u201d Koroye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re open to applications from Digital Nomads. If you\u2019re an African who\u2019s travelling the world while working or living abroad for work, please send me an email at timi@bigcabal.com and sultan@bigcabal.com or fill this form.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "When writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional PromiseThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round.",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How to navigate delivery apps and traditional logistics companies in Lagos and Kaduna",
          "text": "This week\u2019s Everyday People comes with a little twist. In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Co-founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Co-founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up.

          "title": "2023: Beam searchlight on child-voting, Nigerians task INEC",
          "text": "They set out for voting at dawn, move in droves; unconsciously waiting in line that stretches for a long distance, walk up to a polling booth, obtain a ballot paper, and make their choice by voting on the ballot despite not constitutionally recognised under the voting age.\n\nThis has been the practice in some parts of the country, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has appeared incapable of halting the unconstitutional act.\n\nNo doubt, young people have a strong interest in Nigeria\u2019s future but the country\u2019s constitution and Electoral Act say a citizen must attain the age of 18 before he or she can exercise his or her franchise, and anyone who goes contrary to the provision falls afoul of the law because such actions undermine the power of the ballot box, which is the most regular way in which the citizenry engages in the political process.\n\nReports have shown that thuggery, vote buying, faulty card readers as well as child voting in Nigeria, especially in some northern parts of Africa\u2019s most populous country, had, over the years, been identified as major factors fueling electoral fraud and posing serious threats to the credibility of elections.\n\nWith the upgrade to the electoral laws and as the election year fast approaches, citizens have said it was another golden opportunity for Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to demonstrate its strength, bequeath a legacy to generations yet unborn by ensuring no slip is entertained and make history in 2023 that will engender a rebuild of the nation.\n\nAlthough Nigerians eagerly await to cast their votes next year on the back of the different off-cycle governorship elections supervised by INEC, which pundits ranked better than previous elections, there are concerns about obstacles impeding the electoral processes and the strategies that will be deployed to counter these issues.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the recent assurance made by the electoral body that the commission was determined to conduct the best election ever in 2023, political watchers say unless INEC beats the menace of child-voting, among other challenges, these factors will continue to be a bottleneck to the strengthening of the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nMahmood Yakubu, chairman of INEC, had recently given the assurance while addressing a delegation from the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute on the assessment of the preparation for the 2023 general election at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThank you very much for all the kind words you have said about Osun. We are encouraged but there is still a lot of work to do, and we assure you that we will continue to work not only hard but even harder to deliver the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cBut as for the preparation for the 2023 general election, I want to assure you that we promised Nigerians that Ekiti was going to be good and Ekiti was a good election. We promised that Osun was going to be better, Osun was a better election. We are promising that the 2023 general election will be our best election ever and we are committed to delivering the best election ever,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nOsazee Edigin, a human rights activist and coordinator of Action for Socio-political and Economic Change (ASEC), opined that there are noticeable enhancements in the electoral process but INEC officials need to put on their thinking caps to stamp out illegal interferences in elections because Nigerians are gradually regaining confidence in the nation\u2019s electoral arbiter.\n\n\u201cThere are somewhat improvement in our electoral process over the years, hence incidents of ballot snatching had been replaced with vote buying, a financial inducement mechanism. The new technology deployed by INEC has also eliminated the issues of missing ballots and all whatnots.\n\n\u201c2023 preparation by INEC might likely build more confidence in the minds of the people. The rate politicians are taking campaigns seriously is changing because they already know and understand that the forthcoming election may not be the same as before,\u201d Edigin said.\n\nRecommending on how INEC can surmount the challenges of underage voting, the human rights activist said: \u201cThe electoral body needs to design a system that is integrated with the Bank Verification Number (BVN) and National Identification Number (NIN) platforms to be able to filter out such attempt to register underage voters.\n\n\u201cThere should be a synchrony of database across national databases. For instance, when you are requested to mandatorily tender any of the following; your International passport, driver\u2019s licence, BVN or NIN before voter\u2019s registration, it becomes a little bit difficult for one to declare a different age from original age.\u201d\n\n\u201cChild voting still remains a major issue INEC has not been able to surmount. This is prevalent in the northern part of Nigeria. Election rigging is the reason child voting is still very much in practice. We don\u2019t see this being eradicated in the near future as it has become endemic in the northern region,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe latest development in monitoring results online will engender confidence and reduce voters\u2019 apathy which hitherto was as a result of lack of confidence in the process. More less privileged citizens can now have confidence to contest in elections if they feel they are popular because rigging of elections is more difficult with the innovation.\n\nEdigin, therefore, canvassed for the adoption of electronic voting, noting that \u201cUntil we get to the point that we don\u2019t need to go to the physical poll to be able to cast our votes, vote buying and thuggery will not be eliminated. I think the problem with this method is the consideration for the elderly and rural dwellers who might not be too familiar with the operation of new technology.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay Sunday in Benin City, Bright Oniovokukor, project director, Indomitable Youths Organisation (IYO), a non-governmental organisation, called for additional means of biodata confirmation to verify ages of registrants with a view to erasing ineligible voters.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that it has happened even though it was denied in some quarters. The picture and video evidence have proven this beyond reasonable doubts that it happened.\n\n\u201cFor those underage children to be on the voters\u2019 register, it\u2019s either their ages were falsified or someone manipulated the system that was supposed to accept only 18 years and above. Yes, it is disappointing and INEC needs to step up effort to clean up the voters\u2019 register by removing those names whose ages are below 18 years.\n\nRead also: The enemy has a vote\n\n\u201cOther means of verification can be utilised to verify the actual age of the person. Again, it\u2019s unfortunate that our data are yet to be synchronised fully.\u201d\n\nOn the recently conducted elections and the big tasks before INEC as regards the 2023 general election, Oniovokukor said the recent development where election results can be monitored online and the online results tallying with results declared is gradually reawakening the confidence of the people, and it can be improved on in next year\u2019s poll.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections is a special one because of the challenges \u2013 particularly insecurity, economic crisis, collapsing education system \u2013 confronting the country. Based on this, the citizens are looking forward to a leader who can take them off this quagmire.\n\n\u201cConsidering the awareness, technology and investment that have been made, INEC is not expected to do less as far 2023 election is concerned. They can make positive or negative history, it depends on the leadership but one thing that is sure is that the people are better informed now than when the 2015 or 2019 elections were conducted. So, INEC needs to take serious note of that.\n\n\u201cAs the system continues to improve, thuggery during elections is gradually fading away. Cases of ballot box snatching have dropped and with effective online monitoring of results, it would drop further. The form of thuggery that is common now is destabilisation of opponents\u2019 strongholds. This, again, can be addressed if the citizens can make peace within themselves.\n\n\u201cAnother major challenge is vote buying. Beyond giving people money in the field, there are other tactical methods in place which INEC do not have the resources to monitor. Vote buying is way beyond INEC and it lies with the citizens. All stakeholders need to play their role in addressing vote buying as INEC cannot do it alone,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Ugolor, executive director of Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ), said the issue of child voting can be avoided if INEC is transparent in disclosing the identity of the voters\u2019 register so that people can go there and validate it before the election.\n\nWhile calling for collective efforts from every Nigerian in the enhancement of the electoral process, Ugolor, however, expressed the optimism that INEC will achieve the desired results in next year\u2019s election.",

          "title": "Why young people will determine Nigeria\u2019s fate in 2023",
          "text": "Few months to the 2023 general election in Nigeria, it is argued that next year\u2019s elections could go down as the most exciting since the country\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\nObservers say the general election would be significant, because the election would be held amid serious socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country.\n\nWith heightened spate of insecurity, widespread corruption and a general sense of dissatisfaction among Nigerians, one can say that the 2023 election represents, perhaps the most pivotal election year in Nigeria.\n\nThus, the obvious reality in today\u2019s Nigeria has reinforced the growing yearning of Nigeria\u2019s youths to play a more active role in the leadership recruitment process in Nigeria ahead of 2023.\n\nThough they failed to take advantage of their numerical strength of over half of the 84,004,084 Nigerians registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in the 2019 elections, the Nigerian youths seem ready to correct that mistake in the 2023 general election.\n\nPerhaps, the #EndSARS nationwide protests by Nigeria\u2019s youths in 2020 brought a new awakening to their minds about their capability to play a pivotal role in governance of the country.\n\nPolitical watchers say that the #EndSARS movement was a clear indication that if Nigeria\u2019s youths unite, they can change the narrative through the ballot.\n\nHowever, such can be seen in the euphoria to get the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) embarked upon by the INEC, which updates have shown that the registrants between 18-34 years are high.\n\nAccording to INEC, out of this number, 4,550,847 are youths between the ages of 18-34 while 1.36 million are those between the ages of 35 to 49.\n\nIt also noted that 556,572 of the fully registered voters are between the ages of 50-69, while only 76,186 are 70 and above.\n\nINEC further revealed that students lead the freshly registered population with 2.33 million while people in business follow with 1.21 million.\n\nFarmers and the fishing population came third with 811,630, followed by 726,255 housewives.\n\nThis implies that, perhaps the youths would have a strong say in the outcome of the 2023 general election.\n\nA sign of the youths voting strength was seen in the just concluded gubernatorial election in Osun State, where David Adeleke, a Nigerian musician, who is popularly known as Davido, used mass mobilisation of the youths to swing victory for Ademola Adeleke, the People\u2019s Democratic Party\u2019s candidate.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has grappled with general low turnout in elections in recent decades, this was noticed in 2019, where only 28 percent of young people who registered voted at the presidential elections and 29 percent of them at the governorship election.\n\nBut stakeholders are optimistic that the situation would improve ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAre the young people ready? I think it is about the young people deciding that they can change the narrative with their numbers.\n\n\u201cIs not to play football on election day, the way they are going out to register, I hope it would also be the same on voting day?\n\n\u201cI think there is a new spirit among young Nigeria, if you see the crowd rushing to get their PVCs that the country needs a new direction in 2023, Wale Ogun, public affairs analyst said.\n\nSpeaking recently, Samson Itodo, executive director, Yiaga Africa, said the 2023 elections is about the young people because demographically they actually have the population.\n\nHe expressed disappointment on the number of youths who came out to vote in the last elections in 2019, adding that the nation is in a stage where young people are not showing interest in the electoral process of the country, not to talk of voting during elections.\n\n\u201cSo it is going to be an election about the young people and they have to make their numbers count and the only way they are going to make their numbers count is if they collect their PVC and they vote for leaders of their choice,\u2019\u2019 Itodo said.\n\nGodfrey Otiono, an Ndokwa, Delta State-born politician, noted that the youths can enforce true change in the country if they work on the same purpose, insist on good leadership and shun juicy offers from vote-buyers and moneybags.\n\nRead also: 2023 elections: Technology, religion, \u2018third forces\u2019, eager youths raise stakes\n\n\u201cIn my senatorial zone, two popular politicians lost shamefully at the party primaries because the youths staged a weeklong protest before the election insisting that if the candidates sail through at the primaries, they will vote against them at the main election. The parties failed them and gave the tickets to more reasonable candidates.\n\nWith the reawakening of the youths today, this kind of good change can happen nationwide\u201d, Otiono observed.\n\nBut Kola Ogunyemi, a lawyer and part-time lecturer, fears that the awakening might be short-lived considering the high level of economic hardship across the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is currently experiencing the highest level of insecurity, inflation and unemployment in the history of the country and the people impacted more by the challenges are the youths. So, we need to be cautious with the optimism of the youths to deliver for the 2023 election because hunger is the weapon of the political class and it has been used very well since 1999,\u201d Ogunyemi said.\n\nOtiono countered the view, saying that every Nigerian should join hands with the youths to salvage the country in the 2023 elections instead of discouraging them.\n\n\u201cShould we give up because of poverty? Let us get angry, sufficiently to oust the looters, haters of development and welfare of the masses. They have stolen enough and are not bothered if the price of petrol is N1000 per litre. The ball is in the court of the youths and we should encourage them to kick it for goal,\u201d Otiono admonished.",

The cost of rod has also gone up and it\u2019s going up by the day.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, beyond the global tendencies of Russia-Ukraine war which has also devalued our naira and making it to depreciate on daily basis and this goes a long way to affect the original cost of contracts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who was conducted round the project by the Commissioner for Works (Highways and Urban Roads) Mr Noel Omodon, explained that government was left with no option than to review the cost of the projects to ensure their timely completion amid biting inflation.\n\n\u201cHaving looked at everything, we needed to save the budget and the earlier we find a pathway to completing the projects the better, otherwise the escalation continues even more on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s quite difficult and we wished we didn\u2019t get into the kind of difficulties we are in to, but we have no choice.\n\n\u201cWe have started the projects and we have to complete them otherwise the contractors will move out of site and when they move out, to remobilise is at a higher cost and we don\u2019t want to go through that route at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unfortunate situation we find ourselves; it distorts our budgeting and we just hope that we are able to continue realigning our budget to keep pace with the construction that we are undergoing.\n\n\u201cBeyond having the infrastructure in place, it also creates jobs for our young ones and we cannot afford to have the contractors move out of site because it will mean that you are going to take food off the table of families which is also not good for us.\n\n\u201cI have been informed that the project would be completed by the end of December, 2022.\n\n\u201cFrom what we are seeing, life is coming back to Isheagu from the excitement on the faces of the people because the road would help them to evacuate their farm produce,\u201d he stated.\u200b\n\nOkowa also inspected ongoing works at the Sector C1 of the Ughelli-Asaba road by Obo River where the contractor said the bridge construction would be completed in October while the road would be ready in December, 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

The answer is no.\n\n\u201cI believe government has been unfair to the Ijaw people given their contributions to the economy of the contribution to the struggle to what comes to Delta State.\n\n\u201cWe will do better than this government; We are prepared to change the narrative.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to judiciously use the resources that will come to Delta State for the benefit of the majority of our people,\u201d Omo-Agege, who was in company of his running mate, Rt. Hon. Friday Ossai Osanebi and the State APC Chairman, Elder Omeni Sobotie, had averred.\n\nReacting to Omo-Agege\u2019s submissions in a statement, Chief Ariyo, himself a former chieftain of the APC, said such utterances were undignifying and short of unifying the ethnic nationalities and political blocs in the state.\n\n\u201cI have carefully watched the campaign of Omo-Agege with regard to the coastal areas of Delta State, where there are Itsekiris and Ijaws.\n\n\u201cHe constantly isolates the Ijaws and neglects the Itsekiris. Apart from being divisive, it is against the rules of campaign and constitutes an insult on the collective intelligence of people of the area; both Ijaws and Itsekiris. This is low!\n\n\u201cIt is not about keying in or keying out.

          "text": "Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has said that Bola Tinubu, his All Progressives Congress (APC), is mentally unstable and cannot sit for a one hour interview.\n\nThe former vice president who tackled Tinubu over his earlier attack on him via a statement issued by media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, said the ex governor of Lagos has not sat down to do any prolonged interview for obvious reasons.\n\nThe Tinubu Campaign Organisation had stated that it was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the PDP\u2019s presidential candidate during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nThe organisation accused the former vice president of violating provisions of the 1999 constitution when he decided to have other business interest as a young Custom Officer.\n\nBut reacting in a statement on Saturday, Atiku\u2019s aide expressed amusement in what he described as a knee jerk response from the Tinubu Campaign Organisation to the \u201cwave making interview granted by Waziri Atiku Abubakar to Arise TV.\u201d\n\nIbe mocked Tinubu, saying the former governor has not sat down to do any prolonged interview for obvious reasons.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians have seen him talk in public and can themselves gauge the reason why he is mortified to grant any prolong interview.\n\nAtiku\u2019s aide said: \u201cThe Tinubu campaign exposed its gross desperation and vacuousness by citing the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) 1999, to declare Waziri Atiku Abubakar\u2019s stance on engaging in a side business while he was a young custom officer as a breach of the law. It is pertinent to educate the Tinubu campaign organisation that Nigeria is not under a military regime and our Constitutions are not retroactive in nature.\n\n\u201cAgain, the Tinubu campaign betrayed either dishonesty or lack of attention to detail by claiming that Atiku Abubakar said oil contributed 20% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. That is a lie. What the Waziri said is as follows: \u201cOil only maybe accounts for about 20% of our GDP\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe use of the word maybe by the Waziri was in reflection to the different figures given. While the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics states a figure close to 10%, other multilateral organisations have given a much higher figure of between 15-20%. So, while the jury is still out, it is right to qualify the contribution of oil and gas as a maybe. However, we do like to point out that Waziri Atiku Abubakar mentioned both the PDP and the APC during the interview and did not forget the name of his own party.\n\n\u201cIt seems the Tinubu campaign organisation (can a disorganised body be called an organisation?) does not know the meaning of rotation of power and micro zoning. So, we will gladly educate them. Rotation of power refers to a constitutional provision where power is zoned between North and South. Micro-zoning refers to a non constitutional idea, where power is zoned not between North and South, but amongst geo-political zones. We hope this cures the political illiteracy of the authors of that document.\n\n\u201cThe rude response also accuses Waziri Atiku Abubakar of having \u201climited education\u201d. Atiku Abubakar has an earned Masters degree from Anglia Ruskin University. We challenge any of the present Presidential candidates to present an equal or higher degree. Moreover, his university attendance is a matter of verified record. Can we say the same about some other persons?\n\n\u201cOn President Lincoln, we are afraid the poor student of history is the Tinubu campaign disorganisation. Yes, it is true that Lincoln ran for President with his name on the ballot twice. But he ran at other times, and failed to get his name on the ballot.\u201d\n\nAtiku challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour long interview, like the Atiku did, promising to engage with the former Lagos State Governor if he is able to be as articulate and mentally present as the PDP candidate.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat,\u201d Atiku\u2019s aide stated.",

          "title": "2023: You\u2019re a desperate liar \u2013 Tinubu attacks Atiku over Muslim-Muslim ticket",
          "text": "Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has berated Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party Party (PDP), describing him a desperate who should never be president of Nigeria.\n\nTinubu\u2019s attack on the former vice president is in reaction to an Arise Television interview aired on Friday in which he addressed a lot of issues including a claim that he fell out with Tinubu in 2007 because he (Atiku) was opposed to a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nIn response to a question on his thoughts on the Muslim-Muslim Presidential ticket of the APC, Atiku said: \u201cMy fundamental disagreement with Asiwaju since 2007 was on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket. That was my fundamental disagreement and departure from Asiwaju.\n\n\u201cTogether with Asiwaju, we formed ACN and I was given a ticket in Lagos and he insisted to be my running mate and I said no, I am not going to have a Muslim-Muslim ticket and because of that he switched his support to the late Umaru Yar`Adua and that was the departing point and of course, it is also a fact that when Buhari emerged in Lagos in 2015 that I also opposed a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cI opposed it and my opposition actually reinforced the decision of President Buhari to pick a Christian running mate. So, I have all along opposed that. I don\u2019t believe in that. I don\u2019t believe it is right for a country like Nigeria that is multi-ethnic, multi religious that there should be balancing of interests, whether religious or otherwise.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as Tinubu\u2019s running mate would not damage his (Atiku\u2019s) chances in the Northeast, the PDP candidate said, \u201cCertainly, prospects are much higher. If you know the composition of the Northeast, you have Borno and Yobe; these are essentially two Kanuri states, then you have the other states which are essentially Hausa-Fulani. So, even if people are going to vote on that basis, I think I have a more favourable (support) from the Northeast.\u201d\n\nHowever, speaking through his campaign organization on Saturday in a statement, Tinubu faulted most of the claims made by the former vice president, noting that the APC was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the PDP presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIn the interview, Alhaji Atiku exposed himself as a man who is not prepared for the job he is applying for and a man who can not be entrusted with our commonwealth. He was flippant in his response to important questions about his record of service and how he made money while serving in Customs. He muddled up facts and exhibited befudling absence of mind\u201d, Tinubu said through the Director, Media and Communication of his campaign organization, Mr Bayo Onanuga.\n\nStating that the PDP candidate bungled the interview, Tinubu also described him as a lawbreaker.\n\nHe said; \u201cPDP candidate is a law breaker: It was most shocking Atiku admitted that he cheated the system for decades and engaged in gross misconduct as a government worker. As a customs officer at the Idi-Iroko border, Atiku revealed that he ran a commercial taxi service, claiming \u2018there is no law stopping public officers from doing business in Nigeria\u201d. He punched harder, claiming there is no conflict of interest in doing so.\n\n\u201cWe found this to be untrue. Every officer in the civil service is expected to comply with a code of conduct and service rules which bar civil and public servants from engaging in private business while in government employment to the detriment of the service he/she is employed to render to the public. The 1999 constitution further codifies this in Part I, Fifth Schedule, Section of 2 (b).\n\n\u201cIt says a public officer shall not, except where he is not employed on full-time basis engage or participate in the management or running of any private business, profession or trade. The rules however allow a public officer to engage in farming.\n\n\u201cWe wonder which rule or which law Atiku was relying upon for his gross misconduct as a public officer. It is our considered view that Atiku gamed the system all through his career in public service, culminating in his founding of the Intel Logistics along with Late Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and some Italians, even while he was still in the employment of the Nigeria Customs Service\u201d.\n\nHe said Atiku also has a poor knowledge of key sectors of the economy, adding; \u201cWe also found it surprising that the PDP presidential candidate does not know the contribution of oil and gas industry to Nigeria\u2019s GDP. He claimed the sector represents 20% of our national GDP whereas it is below 10 percent and it is still falling owing to the growth of non-oil sector under the current All Progressives Congress led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cFalse Data from Egypt: Atiku Abubakar wanted to impress his audience with his supposed knowledge of international affairs. He ended up embarrassing himself with false data he cited from Egypt. We found his claim that Egypt has 2 million police officers on the streets to be untrue. Various sources put the number at about 500,000 for a population of 104 million and not 80 million as falsely claimed by Atiku\u201d.\n\nOn the issue of Rotational Presidency, Tinubu said Atiku should be more focused on the issue and not a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cAsked to justify why the PDP jettisoned Section 3c of its own constitution which enshrines power rotation between the North and South, Atiku tried to fudge his answer by focusing on Governor Nyesom Wike and his effort to reconcile with him after he, a northerner snatched the presidential ticket that ought to have been taken by a southerner. While Atiku was playing to the gallery on APC\u2019s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, he didn\u2019t see seeking to be President after 8years of a President from his part of Nigeria as politics of exclusion.\n\n\u201cProbed further, Atiku provided several contradictory answers. In one breath, he said power rotation is not in the constitution. In another breath, he said the PDP has never \u2018micro zoned any position\u2019. Then he admitted that the party has always rotated power between the North and the South. Atiku\u2019s justification as to why he became PDP\u2019s presidential candidate, instead of a southerner is a perfect example in ellipsis: \u2018In politics\u2019, he said, \u2018we negotiate power through negotiations(sic)\u2019. Whatever that means.\n\n\u201cAtiku ever an expert in not telling the truth also did not come clean over his once-upon a time preference for same-faith ticket. In 1993, after Atiku and Kingibe lost to MKO Abiola in the SDP presidential primary in Jos, Atiku was the choice of the Yar\u2019Adua camp to become Abiola\u2019s running mate. Abiola overlooked him and picked the more cerebral diplomat and bureaucrat, Babagana Kingibe. In all the tonnes of biographies written about him, there was no where he said he opposed Shehu Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s support for his candidacy as Abiola\u2019s VP. He was not against it, since it favoured him. Now, it is politically convenient and opportunistic for him to oppose Tinubu-Shettima ticket.\n\n\u201cPolitical Credentials: Most reprehensible was Atiku\u2019s lies about how many times he ran to become the governor of Adamawa or old Gongola state.\n\n\u201cMr. Presidential candidate, in case you don\u2019t know due to your limited education, you run for an office, only, when you are on the ballot in an election. Your signifying interest in an office does not mean the same as running for the office. From available records, the first time you contested the governorship election in your state was in 1999. Your name entered the ballot for the first time and you won.\n\n\u201cPoor grasp of history: Atiku Abubakar also exhibited poor Knowledge of history when he claimed that Abraham Lincoln, one of America\u2019s famous leaders contested the presidency five to six times before he eventually won.\n\n\u201cThis is a beer parlour tale that has been recycled over time. Lincoln contested U.S. presidency twice. He ran in 1860 and 1864 and won both, before he was assassinated on 15 April, 1865.\n\n\u201cThe false story about Lincoln\u2019s failed presidential bids sprang from his previous failed state and national elections, from his state of Illinois. They were not the same as America\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cAccording to historians, Lincoln lost his first election in 1832 for Illinois state legislature. In 1834, he ran again and won.\n\n\u201cIn 1843 he ran for Congress. He lost. Three years after in 1846, Lincoln ran for Congress again \u2013 this time he won and went to Washington. From established history, in 1848, Lincoln ran for re-election to Congress and lost. In 1854, he ran for Senate of the United States. He lost. Lincoln also made another failed bid for U.S. Senate from Illinois in 1858. He lost to Democrat Steven Douglas.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is ill-prepared to be President of Nigeria if he could bungle a Television interview that was planned well ahead of the day and time the duo of Dr. Reuben Abati and Ms.Tundun Abiola conducted it.\n\n\u201cWe expected the PDP presidential candidate to be well informed on any issue before coming on national television to expose himself to avoidable ridicule\u201d, he stated.",
          "summary": "In response to a question on his thoughts on the Muslim-Muslim Presidential ticket of the APC, Atiku said: \u201cMy fundamental disagreement with Asiwaju since 2007 was on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket.\nStating that the PDP candidate bungled the interview, Tinubu also described him as a lawbreaker.\nOn the issue of Rotational Presidency, Tinubu said Atiku should be more focused on the issue and not a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\nPresidential candidate, in case you don\u2019t know due to your limited education, you run for an office, only, when you are on the ballot in an election.\n\u201cWe expected the PDP presidential candidate to be well informed on any issue before coming on national television to expose himself to avoidable ridicule\u201d, he stated.",

China will likely cede the title to Japan, as Chinese imports of LNG are set for the largest-ever annual plunge since China started importing the super-chilled fuel in 2006.\n\nThough LNG imports by state-owned companies coming into China from Nigeria LNG have risen in January 2015.\n\nSimilarly, Japan, bought the largest share of Nigeria\u2019s LNG exports the same year, data from the World Oil and Gas Review 2014 has shown.\n\nWeakening gas demand in China, increased domestic production of natural gas, policies to support coal as the \u201cenergy security\u201d tool, and of course, the much higher spot LNG prices this year, have all combined to reduce Chinese purchases of LNG so far in 2022, consultants Wood Mackenzie said in an analysis.\n\nWood Mackenzie expects China\u2019s LNG imports to drop to 69 million tons (Mt) this year, which would be an unprecedented 14 per cent annual decline the steepest drop since China first imported LNG back in 2006.\n\nAccording to WoodMac, China\u2019s gas demand fell by 5 percent year over year in the second quarter due to high gas import prices, economic slowdown with COVID-related lockdowns, warmer winter than usual, and support for \u2018cleaner\u2019 coal as Chinese authorities have been prioritising energy security since the power outages last autumn.\n\nSo far this year, China has stayed away from costly spot LNG cargoes as prices soared with the energy crisis last autumn and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sent Europe racing to buy LNG to replace as much Russian pipeline gas as soon as possible.\n\nThe altered energy markets have upended Chinese LNG import policies, too. In 2021, China was the biggest buyer of LNG in the world, and the United States was the largest supplier of spot LNG volumes to China, the EIA said earlier this year.\n\nFrom February to April 2022, Chinese imports of LNG from the U.S. plunged by 95 per cent compared to the same period in 2021. So far this year, the United States has sent the occasional LNG cargo to China, but most American exports have headed to Europe, which is paying more for spot LNG supply.\n\nEurope is pricing out Asia for spot deliveries and is turning to LNG, mostly from America, to cut its still heavy dependence on Russian gas. At the same time, China is buying more LNG from Russia, which the West doesn\u2019t want to touch.\n\nHigh spot LNG prices and lackluster demand due to China\u2019s zero-COVID lockdowns have significantly reduced Chinese appetite for spot U.S. LNG this year. Chinese firms have signed several long-term agreements for U.S. LNG, joining the trend of buyers returning to long-term deals to avoid costly spot LNG supply in a market where Europe is scrambling to secure volumes to avoid a winter of rationing and industry collapse.\n\n\u201cChinese buyers have minimised their exposure to costly spot LNG. Spot purchases were muted, and reportedly, some Chinese players resold cargoes into the European market,\u201d Wood Mackenzie research director, Miaoru Huang said.\n\nHigh spot prices and weaker demand from the power sector as coal is being prioritized are set to lead to the biggest Chinese LNG import decline on record.\n\nChina has been putting more emphasis on energy security since the autumn of 2021.\n\nEarlier this year, just after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China said it would continue to maximize the use of coal in the coming years as it caters to its energy security, despite pledges to contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions.",

Both the banking industry and the organized private sector play major roles in growing the economy. The need for the two sectors to work closely cannot be overemphasized. ACAMB is therefore reaching out to secure the participation of relevant speakers at the conference,\u201d Bolarinwa said.\n\nChief executive and registrar, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Dr Seye Awojobi, also speaking on the forthcoming conference, said the main focus of the event is to bring together the main sectors for the benefit of the national economy.\n\nAccording to him, the conference will correct any perceived misunderstandings between the two sectors which would be examined critically to proffer common grounds that can foster understanding and progress.\n\nThe governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) is expected to be the keynote speaker just as presidents of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), NACCIMA and Manufacturers Association of Nigeria(MAN) will also be speaking at the event.\n\n\u201cConstant engagement and communication are at the heart of building synergy for cooperation and collaboration. An excellent mutual relationship between the banking industry and the Organised Private Sector will promote the desired sustainable growth and development of the national economy. This would in turn enable both groups to compete effectively in the regional and international markets,\u201d Bolarinwa said.\n\nHe added that the forthcoming ACAMB conference is expected to chart the course for effective areas of collaboration for the growth of the national economy at this challenging time.\n\n\u201cThe conference offers a unique platform for private sector players and the banking community to share perspectives on how the synergy, communication, cooperation and mutual understanding between these two critical segments of the Nigerian economy can be improved to benefit the Nigerian people and economy progressively.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the session, we expect a robust communique that will provide a road map for a new relationship between the banking and the OPS,\u201d Bolarinwa said.",

          "text": "The hottest places in Hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.\u201d (Dante Aliegri)\n\nThe unfolding certificate forgery scandal hanging around the neck of Pastor Umo Eno, the man whom Deacon Udom Emmanuel and his boys \u2013 Barr. Emmanuel Enoidem , Enobong Uwah and Frank Archibong imposed as the \u2018governorship candidate\u2019 of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) in our dear State is such that men and women of good conscience who mean well for this State can no longer sit back and watch or stand and stare as if it is of no consequence. Yes , the threesome have made their money , extended their empires and are living large , bestriding the state and country as colossuses. The unfortunate and unfolding Ordinary level certificate forgery saga has brought an unmitigated embarrassment and shame on Akwa Ibom people and the whole state with potentials of even wider implications. Akwa Ibom State has a solid standing as a land that has produced well educated men and women who have excelled in academia, businesses and the professions over the years. For crying out loud , this is the home state of revered icons like the late international jurist, Hon.Dr.Egbert Udo Udoma , who distinguished himself as a first class scholar in Dublin in the 1930\u2019s. This state also produced the legendary Barr. O.O.Ita of Oro extraction. This state had the educationist, Professor Eyo Ita , the 7 merchants of light , including Professors Essien Udom, Donald Ekong , Reuben Uko , Sam Akpabot , Etim Essien , Okon Uya , Enyenihi and thousands of others in the state , across Nigeria and in the Diaspora. The dead , among them would be turning in their graves over this shame that has turned Akwa Ibom into a butt of jokes and a laughing stock everywhere in the 21st century.\n\nHow have the mighty fallen ?\n\nWho would explain to future generations that the state that produced world class public Administrators like Chief Ntieyong Akpan , Ekukinam Bassey, Ime Ebong, Clement Isong, public intellectuals like Moses Ekpo, Nelson Etukudo, Ahaziah Umana, Ray Ekpu , Effiong Essien , Timtiniko Enodien, Nsikak Essien , Udeme Ufot , a guru in advertising and Anietie Usen to name just a few among several others is now using state resources to promote a Governorship candidate with questionable basic academic qualifications ? What shall we tell our children ?\n\nWould we tell them that lying one\u2019s way to appointment and government position is just okay and that they should muddle their way through life like Umo Eno ? Is this not witchcraft ? Are the sponsors of Umo Eno not bewitching Akwa Ibom people while singing and dancing during Government house prayer gatherings ? Who does not know that failing examinations is not bad but no reasonable person should support the deliberate procurement of fake examination results to gain advantage in any society. Why is Udom Emmanuel paying Akwa Ibom back with a counterfeit coin ?\n\nWhat would Prelate Mbang and other Fathers of Faith tell their grandchildren about this saga ? Is Prelate Mbang who prayed during the unveiling of Umo Eno at peace with himself ? Does a man who went to the best schools , served as National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria and President of World Methodist Communion sleep well at night in his old age for not questioning the process which threw up Umo Eno as the right choice to lead Akwa Ibom State from 2023 ? What would Archbishop Joseph Ekuwem say about this ? That the home state of the first Cardinal of West Africa has gone this low ? And that his younger brother , a well known ICT expert was a part of the decision making cabal ?Who bewitched Obong Victor Attah to eat this humble pie and become the person assigned to bless this mess at every turn ? Does Obong Attah now listen to himself ?\n\nOne recalls that Deacon Udom Emmanuel had told the people of the state that it was God who revealed Umo Eno to him but at different interviews with Journalists recently, Obong Attah has declared that there was a group behind that choice. Who constituted that group and who were the Members ? He hasn\u2019t said ! How on earth can Arc. Victor Attah emerge as the new spokesperson to a man young enough to be his son ? No wonder , Ekerete Udo , the greatest pretender to the office of Chief Press Secretary to the Governor since the creation of that office has gone into hiding because former Governor Attah has taken over his job ! What a time to be alive in Akwa Ibom State !\n\nBut must Umo Eno be Governor at all cost and by all means ? What does Deacon Udom Emmanuel want to hide that another person could not have covered up for him ?\n\nWhy is the sneaky ambition of one man bigger than the collective health and sustainable wellbeing of a state with more than 7 million people ? Why are the promoters of this particular Candidate so obstinate and bullish in wrongdoing in a wrong direction ?\n\nOkay, Enobong Uwah wants to become the Secretary to the State Government, and Frank Archibong wants to continue in his present office, while Enoidem plans to run the show from the Senate in Abuja and prepare to take over in 2031! These are the three \u2018wise\u2019 henchmen who have brought this roof down on Akwa Ibom State and pressed the entire state to it\u2019s knees.\n\nSo far , the image of this state has been tarnished , it\u2019s high time people moved to save what remains of it for the sake of posterity.\n\nAkwa Ibom leaders should not be seen to be condoning bad behavior bordering on criminality. It is trite saying that evil rules when good people keep silent.\n\nA stitch in time, they say, saves nine , Governor Udom Emmanuel should pull back and back off from this wretched path now to save this State from eternal shame.\n\nWhether the SANs hired to defend Umo Eno succeed in buying the case or not , the conflicting certificates, birthdates, marriage date, the legal imbroglio has damaged Candidate Umo Eno beyond redemption and derobed him of every value to serve in any capacity in Akwa Ibom State going forward. He should be released to return to his hotel business.\n\nUdom Emmanuel should come off his high horse , humble himself , proceed on a weekend dry fasting with all the fathers of faith for using the name of God in vain and for \u2018playing the street\u2019 with the generality of Akwa Ibom people. A stitch in time , indeed , saves nine !\n\nBassey Udosen writes from Mkpok, ONNA in Akwa Ibom State.",

          "text": "The United Nations, UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has indicted both Nigeria and Kenya Governments for the arrest and extraordinary rendition, torture and continued detention of the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, without due process.\n\nUN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\nIt also recommended that Government officials responsible for the torture meted to the IPOB Leader be investigated and punished.\n\nThe UN body further directed Nigeria to report back within six months of the transmission of its opinions on Kanu\u2019s matter, steps taken to comply with all the recommendations thereof.\n\nIt referred the case of Kanu\u2019s torture to Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration\n\nThe UN Working Group also threatened to take further action to ensure the recommendations are complied with, noting that both Nigeria and Kenya are signatories to the Convention and should comply.\n\nThe 16-page report dated July 20, 2022 was adopted on April 4 by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its 93rd session, held between March 30 \u2013 April 8, 2022.\n\nThe unedited version of the document sighted by Vanguard, was marked:\u201dOpinion No. 25/2022 concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu (Nigeria and Kenya).\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established in resolution 1991/42 of the UN Commission on Human Rights.\n\nIn accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group, on December 30, 2021, transmitted to the Nigeria and Kenya Governments, a communication concerning\n\nMr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria replied to the communication on 25 January 2022 while the Government of Kenya did not reply.\n\nBoth countries are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe Working Group said in the report that Kanu was a victim of State persecution as Nigeria failed to provide convincing explanations with proof that he is guilty of treason and other criminal allegations levelled against him.\n\n\u201cNoting the failure of the Government to explain what actions of Mr. Kanu amounted\n\nto such criminal acts and how, and observing the lack of any evidence that any of his actions may in fact amount to such crimes, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu is in fact being persecuted for the peaceful exercise of his rights, most notably his freedom of opinion and expression.\n\n\u201cIn the present case, the Government of Nigeria has presented no exceptions permitted under article 19 (3) of the Covenant nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Kanu\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression was anything but peaceful.\n\n\u201d In fact, the Government has chosen not to provide any explanation for the arrest, detention and subsequent proceedings against Mr. Kanu. In these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\n\nThe Working Group also said there was no evidence that International laws were observed in the arrest and rendition of Kanu from Kenya.\n\nThe 16-page dossier read in part: \u201cIn the present case, Mr. Kanu was not furnished with an arrest warrant by Nigerian\n\nauthorities nor was he promptly informed of the grounds for his arrest in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, the Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu\u2019s continued deprivation of liberty\n\nviolates his rights under articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article\n\n9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4, and 10 of the Body of Principles and constitutes\n\narbitrary detention under category I.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning to the uncontested allegations that following his rendition to Nigeria,\n\nMr. Kanu remained in pre-trial detention with his trial having been scheduled to commence\n\nin January 2022, the Working Group recalls that it is a well-established norm of international law that pre-trial detention should be the exception rather than the rule, and should be ordered for the shortest time possible. Put differently, liberty is recognised under article 9 (3) of the Covenant as the core consideration with detention merely as an exception.\n\n\u201cTherefore, detention pending trial must be based on an individualised determination that it is reasonable and necessary for such purposes as to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrence of crime. Such determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, in accordance with article 9 (3) of the Covenant, an arrested person is to be\n\nbrought before a judge within 48 hours.27 This was not satisfied in the case of Mr. Kanu and\n\nthe Working Group therefore finds a violation of articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration\n\nof Human Rights, article 9 (3) of the Covenant and principles 11, 37 and 38 of the Body of\n\nPrinciples.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in order to establish that a detention is indeed legal, anyone detained has\n\nthe right to challenge the legality of his or her detention before a court, as guaranteed by\n\narticle 9 (4) of the Covenant. The Working Group wishes to recall that according to the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures on the Rights of Anyone Deprived of their Liberty to Bring Proceedings before a Court, the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court is a self-standing human right, which is essential to preserve legality in a democratic society.\n\n\u201cThis right, which is in fact a peremptory norm of international law, applies to all forms of deprivation of liberty, 29 to \u201call situations of\n\ndeprivation of liberty, including not only to detention for purposes of criminal proceedings but also to situations of detention under administrative and other fields of law, including military detention, security detention, detention under counter-terrorism measures\u201d.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it also applies \u201cirrespective of the place of detention or the legal terminology used in the legislation. Any form of deprivation of liberty on any ground must be subject to\n\neffective oversight and control by the judiciary. This was also denied to Mr. Kanu, thus, violating his right under article 9 (4) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFinally, turning to Mr. Kanu\u2019s pre-trial detention in Nigeria, the Working Group\n\nrecalls that according to international human rights law, in particular article 9 (3) of the\n\nCovenant, any person detained while awaiting trial is entitled to trial within a reasonable\n\ntime, or otherwise shall be released. Article 14 (3) (c) of the Covenant also guarantees the\n\nright of anyone charged with a criminal offence to be tried without undue delay. In the\n\nabsence of a substantive response from the Government of Nigeria, the Working Group finds no legitimate grounds for the delays in the trials against Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Working Group finds that the Government of Nigeria failed to\n\nestablish a legal basis for the detention of Mr. Kanu. His detention is thus arbitrary under\n\ncategory I.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said that both the Nigerian and Kenyan Governments should take responsibility for Kanu\u2019s rights violations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group wishes once again to underscore the collusion between the\n\nGovernments of Kenya and Nigeria in the rendition of Mr. Kanu and reiterates that both\n\nGovernments bear joint responsibility for any violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in Kenya and\n\nNigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group has already established in its discussion of the detention of Mr. Kanu in Kenya that he was arrested and detained due to the peaceful exercise of his rights (see paras 52-54 above). The Working Group notes that the source has argued the same in relation to Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest, detention and trial proceedings in Nigeria. Notably, the\n\nGovernment of Nigeria has chosen not to address the substance of these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group notes that it is not contested that Mr. Kanu is accused of the crime of conspiracy to commit a treasonable felony through an agreement with others to be broadcast from London, in view of the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty. The source notes that, while treason consists of \u201clevying war\u201d against Nigeria under Nigerian law, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not allege any action implicating Mr. Kanu in the contemplation, planning, or incitement of war against Nigeria. The source argues that\n\nMr. Kanu was in fact advocating for a peaceful referendum for the establishment of a Biafran\n\nsovereignty, in conformity with international and other relevant laws.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group recalls that freedom of opinion and expression, as expressed in article 19 of the Covenant, is an indispensable condition for the full development of the person. It is essential for any society and constitutes the foundation stone for every free and democratic society. It also recalls that freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and that this right includes the expression and receipt of communications of every form of idea and opinion capable of transmission to others, including political\n\nopinions.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in Resolution 12/16, the Human Rights Council called on States to refrain\n\nfrom imposing restrictions which are not consistent with article 19 (3), including on the\n\ndiscussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights; engaging in peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group further said that the Nigeria Government could not disprove claims by Kanu that he was denied effective lagal representation including access to his US lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe source has submitted, and the Government did not address, that Mr. Kanu was denied effective legal representation. The Working Group considers legal representation as being a core facet of the right to a fair trial. Legal assistance should be available at all stages of criminal proceedings, namely, pre-trial, trial, and appellate stages, to ensure compliance with fair trial guarantees. Any denial of access to lawyers substantially undermines and compromises an accused individual\u2019s capacity to defend him or herself in any judicial proceedings.\n\n\u201cAs the Working Group has stated in principle 9 and guideline 8 of its Basic Principles,\n\npersons deprived of their liberty have the right to legal assistance by counsel of their choice,\n\nat any time during their detention, including immediately after the moment of apprehension, and must be promptly informed of this right upon apprehension. Access to legal counsel should not be unlawfully or unreasonably restricted.\n\n\u201cArticle 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant entitles defendants to adequate time and facilities\n\nfor the preparation of their defence and to communicate with counsel of their own choosing. Defendants must have access to documents and other evidence, including \u201call materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that could assist the defence.\n\n\u201cRecalling general comment No. 32, a detainee has the right to have \u201cprompt access\u201d to legal counsel, meaning that a lawyer must be able to have private communications and\n\nmeetings with the detainee and be able to attend all the investigations without interference or restrictions. A detainee also ought to have access to \u201ceffective counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this was denied to Mr. Kanu. In the Working Group\u2019s view, by failing to allow\n\nMr. Kanu to be represented by lawyers of his choice, including an international counsel,\n\nthe Government denied Mr. Kanu\u2019s right to legal assistance at all times, which is inherent in the right to liberty and security of the person as well as the right to a fair and public hearing\n\nby a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in accordance with articles 3, 9, 10 and 11 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 14 of the\n\nCovenant, articles 37 (b) and (d) and 40 (2) (b) (ii) and principles 15, 17 and 18 of the Body\n\nof Principles and principles 1, 5, 7, 8, 21 and 22 of the Basic Principles on the Role of\n\nLawyers.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also disturbed by the source\u2019s report of the treatment of\n\nMr. Kanus\u2019s lawyers and recalls its jurisprudence highlighting that such treatment of lawyers is entirely unacceptable and violates articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant.41 It is the legal and positive duty of the State to protect everyone on its territory or under its jurisdiction against any human rights violation and to provide remedy whenever a violation still occurs.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s presumption of innocence was\n\nviolated as the Department surrounded the court complex with an array of armed forces,\n\ncreating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger (see para. 9), a submission which the\n\nGovernment has chosen not to contest. The Working Group recalls that defendants should\n\nnot be presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals, as this also undermines the presumption of innocence.The Working Group finds a breach of article 14 (2) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following his\n\nrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters\n\nof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria. He is reportedly currently still held in a very small cell where he is exposed to daily psychological and mental torture without access to other inmates or any other person except for the Department officers. Mr. Kanu is also allegedly denied access to reading or writing materials and has been refused access to professional medical care despite a serious heart ailment.\n\n\u201cThe source reports that Mr. Kanu\u2019s life is in jeopardy and that he suffers from a medical condition occasioned by gradual depletion of potassium in his system, which has defied any medical solution given to him within the Department facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is seriously concerned about the treatment to which Mr. Kanu\n\nhas been subjected. Especially noting its finding that Mr. Kanu was subjected to\n\nextraordinary rendition as well as his treatment prior to that, the Working Group considers it unlikely that Mr. Kanu would have been able to effectively assist with and participate in his own defence during the proceedings against him, and that such treatment roceedings against him, rendering them inherently unfair and unjust, in violation of article 14 of the Covenant. For all the reasons above, the Working Group finds that the fair trial rights and procedural guarantees of Mr. Kanu under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant and other relevant human rights standards, were not observed and that such violations are of such gravity as to render Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention arbitrary under category III.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said Nigeria also failed to disprove that Kanu was a victim of political persecution.\n\n\u201cMr. Kanu is an activist and the leader of the organisation Indigenous People of Biafra,\n\nwhich he founded in 2012. The source alleges that the Government of Nigeria is targeting\n\nMr. Kanu due to his political expression, in particular, due to his membership in a group\n\npolitically opposed to the Nigerian Government on the question of Biafra, his widely published criticism of the Government, and his work with and advocacy for the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Government has chosen not to address these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu has indeed been targeted by the Government\n\nas a human rights defender on account of his freedom of opinion and expression as well as\n\nhis position regarding the sovereignty of Biafra. As Mr. Kanu has been targeted on account of his activism in galvanising momentum for a referendum on the sovereignty of Biafra, the Working Group considers that his detention violates articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1) and 26 of the Covenant, and is arbitrary under category V.\n\nConcluding remarks: \u201cThe Working Group wishes to record its very serious concern for the well-being of\n\nMr. Kanu, who, according to the source and uncontested by the Government of Nigeria,\n\nremains in solitary confinement since his arbitrary detention in Nigeria on 29 June 2021. He has been denied medical treatment and medication for his heart condition. The Working Group recalls that prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under rules 43(1)(b) and 44 of the Mandela Rules.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also obliged to remind the Government of Nigeria that in accordance with article 10 of the\n\nCovenant, all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human person and that denial of medical assistance constitutes a violation of the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 24, 25, 27 and 30 in particular.\n\n\u201d According to the source, throughout Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention in Kenya and transfer to\n\nNigeria, no family members knew about his location or could access him, and Mr. Kanu was not permitted to contact his family during this detention. These allegations have not been contested by either Governments. The Working Group stresses that, under international human rights law, all detained and imprisoned individuals have the right to communicate and be visited by their families.\n\n\u201cThe right to receive visits applies to all detainees, \u201cregardless of the offence of which they are suspected or accused.\u201d Under Principle 19 of the Body of Principles, this right could be subject only to conditions and restrictions that are appropriate to a legitimate aim. Neither Governments have argued that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family conformed with this requirement. As a result, the Working Group finds that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family violated his right to contact with the outside world under rules 43 (3) and 58 (1) of the Nelson Mandela Rules and principles 15 and 19 of the Body of Principles.\n\n\u201cNoting the treatment to which Mr. Kanu has been subjected at the hands of both\n\nKenyan and Nigerian authorities as well as his continued solitary confinement, the Working\n\nGroup refers this case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also wishes to reemphasize its very serious concern over the\n\napparent collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria in this case and reiterates its findings that both Governments are jointly responsible for the violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in both jurisdictions. The present Opinion concerns solely the treatment and rights of Mr. Kanu and is sposition\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion:\n\nIn relation to Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nThe deprivation of liberty of Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu, being in\n\ncontravention of articles 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights and articles 2, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 and 26 of the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within Categories I, II, III and V.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr. Kanu without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms, including those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201d The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the\n\ncase, the appropriate remedy would be for the Government of Nigeria to release Mr. Kanu\n\nimmediately and for both Governments to accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.\n\n\u201d In the current context of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of Nigeria to take urgent action to ensure the immediate unconditional release of Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201d The Working Group urges the two Governments to ensure a full and independent\n\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Kanu and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of hisrights.\n\n\u201d In accordance with paragraph 33 (a) of its methods of work, the Working Group refers\n\nthe present case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.\n\nFollow-up procedure:\n\n\u201cIn accordance with paragraph 20 of its methods of work, the Working Group requests\n\nthe source and the Governments to provide it with information on action taken in follow-up\n\nto the recommendations made in the present opinion, including: (a) Whether Mr. Kanu has been released and, if so, on what date;\n\n(b) Whether compensation or other reparations have been made to Mr. Kanu;\n\n(c) Whether an investigation has been conducted into the violation of Mr. Kanu\n\nrights and, if so, the outcome of the investigation; (d) Whether any legislative amendments or changes in practice have been made to harmonize the laws and practices of Kenya and Nigeria with its international obligations in line with the present opinion;\n\n(e) Whether any other action has been taken to implement the present opinion.\n\n\u201cThe Government is invited to inform the Working Group of any difficulties it may\n\nhave encountered in implementing the recommendations made in the present opinion and whether further technical assistance is required, for example through a visit by the Working Group.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the source and the Government to provide the abovementioned information within six months of the date of transmission of the present opinion.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Working Group reserves the right to take its own action in follow-up to the\n\nopinion if new concerns in relation to the case are brought to its attention. Such action would enable the Working Group to inform the Human Rights Council of progress made in\n\nimplementing its recommendations, as well as any failure to take action.\n\n\u201d The Working Group recalls that the Human Rights Council has encouraged all States\n\nto cooperate with the Working Group and has requested them to take account of its views\n\nand, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken\u201d\n\nVictory for freedom fighters \u2013 Kanu\u2019s family\n\nMeanwhile, Kanu\u2019s family has expressed delight over the UN recommendations, describing the report as victory for freedom fighters.\n\nKanu\u2019s younger brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu, who conveyed the position of the family in an exclusive interview with Vanguard, said that Nigeria must comply with the UN recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn as much as they are lawless, they must obey. After now they must still face the music because Internationally they must be held accountable.\u201d",
          "summary": "UN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\nIn these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\nSuch determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following hisrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquartersof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nManufacturing giant of mining explosives, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, yesterday, organized a capacity building training of over 50 mining companies on use of explosives at their sites this is following issues on safe- mining in the solid minerals sector.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the \u2018Two-day Technical Training In Explosives Management and Optimization\u2019 , the Founder and Chairman, NIGACHEM Nigeria Limited, Engr Sylvanus Ghasarah, represented by the Executive Director, Administration and Human Resources, Maureen Tiamiyu, explained that the company deed it fit to give back to its customers across the country through capacity building that would cushion effects of high cost of materials via optimization.\n\nGhasarah also noted that the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent, and there was need to optimize this cost to continue in business.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know how the inflation rate has gone up. We know the exchange rate, how much is gone up. So the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent.\n\n\u201cI know that our product has gone up a lot. So for us to give back a little bit to a customer to appreciate their patronage, we have put up this optimization so that even though the cost has gone up, if they can know how to manage the explosives properly, they can manage their costs more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them to be able to carry out that blast with profits. We don\u2019t want the increase in prices to affect them because sometimes some businesses are closing down. So the aim is for people to be aware. I mean, mining engineers versus the accountants in the organizations versus the owners of the business, everybody needs to come together and put their heads together; the miners need to understand that there is a cost to blasting and the better they can efficiently manage their blasting, the better for the business owners.\n\n\u201cAnd they effect of all the other factors; diesel price has gone up, exchange rate, the effect could be cushioned with optimization basically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he added that the training would be taken to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have started this at this time. We have planned to go to different regions where we have our customer cluster, like I said, is a give back to our customers and our customers all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to have one programme or another to give back to our customers\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Sales, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, Engr Bayo Yusuf, described the capacity building workshop as reawakening training for customers.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody here is not a greenhorn but professionals, and they understand the language, and what we need to do is to just follow up on the product we supply them to make sure they get the best value in the application against the value for their money for using our product\u201d, Yusuf said.\n\nOn the areas lacking among mining companies as customers, he said, \u201cThe emphasis is on security and safety of our products because of global wave of terrorism and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cExplosive if it gets into wrong hands could do a lot of damage. We have to emphasize that whoever buys our products, we have the technology, capacity, and infrastructure to be able to track and trace whatever takes our material.\n\n\u201cWe say to our customers to safeguard our products, ensure you have proper human reliability of your workers so it doesn\u2019t leak out of your premises. Leakage can hardly happen with us but when it gets to the end-user we don\u2019t have control\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also explained that there was difference between his company\u2019s product called Super Power Explosives or 90 Super Power 80, and it is not an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, rather is for civil works- mining, quarrying and oil and gas exploration\n\nHowever, he called on government to make sure roads across the country are reconstructed, rehabilitated and properly maintained, and if not safety and security of Nigerians cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of insecurity on the mining sector, the Director, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Mining and Steel Development, Engr Frank Odom, said there was need to track and monitor movement from point of manufacture to usage or storage as the case maybe, and stressed the need for companies in the mining sector to copy what Coca-cola Bottling Company, Dangote Company, and others are doing to track their trucks.\n\n\u201cThese trucks carrying mining explosives are not monitored while moving on the roads. It is important putting additional measures to know probably on your phone or tablets you can see when a material leaves from the point it was sold or conveyed from or loaded from or even the sea port and to look at it as making progress to where it will be delivered for usage or storage.\n\nThis will prevent diversion, you can raise alarm over delay on the road by calling nearest security agency, you will know what it is happening to the truck every minute.\n\nHe made it known that there will designated companies specifically for explosives movement of explosives, that would be registered and licensed for that purpose, but not there yet because mechanisms are being put together, and he added that the tracking would be done by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHowever, when those companies come on stream they would be compelled to do the same because there is no too much monitoring because it is for the same purpose in order for us not to be lost in anything or caught unawares. So that is the main purpose,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the workshop organised by NIGACHEM will boost and improve productivity of miners as far as safe mining and profitability are concerned, which is also the key in capacity building.\n\nOne of the participants at the workshop, Assistant, Manager, Section 9 (1) Manager, Mines Department, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant, Kogi State, Engr Caleb Aransiola, commended Nigachem for the capacity building and new knowledge acquired as far as optimisation is concerned.\n\nAransiola said Nigachem did not only focused on profit but showed concern to help its customers by giving back to their customers\n\n\u201cDespite two decades of practical experience on the field I still gained a lot from the resource people, who have four decades of experience, especially on the issues we are talking about I\u2019m terms of optimisation\n\n\u201cWhat I am taking back home is to make sure my employer, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant have more profit and the turnover of the business, improve on the cost analysis and making more because if the company doesn\u2019t make profit we also will be out of job.\n\n\u201cI need to improve more on safe-mining because we basically focus on blasting because blasting is the most technical aspect of mining. I need to avoid misfire which at the end we will record success; no fatality and also maximize cost\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the company has strong policy on tracking movement, use, storage and management, which no explosives have left the company since exception due to the high technology and discipline put in place to curb ay breaches, but more will be done to improve on what the company has security of explosives and movement.\n\n[7/22, 1:57 PM] Palma Jennifer: \u201cI will prioritize education, engage youths in nation building\u201d- Adebayo\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adewole Adebayo has promised to prioritize education and engage youths in leadership roles if elected as President of the country next year.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he played host to the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS in Abuja.\n\nWhile promising to represent the interest of the masses and youths through a policy that sustains and guarantees a smooth educational system, Prince Adebayo charged the student body to rise to the defense of the nation\u2019s educational sector.\n\nThe leader of the delegation and national secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Mr. Salahudeen Lukman said the visit was to interface with Presidential flag bearers of political parties on their agenda for the educational sector.\n\nLukman advocated more fundings for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by he Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.",

          "text": "By Kayode Abdulazeez\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele on Thursday commissioned a 600 million naira poultry farm project at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony the CBN governor, who was represented by Edwin Nzelu, Deputy Director and Secretary to ACGSF, Agricultural credit guarantees scheme fund, said CBN introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on creating decent job, boosting poultry production fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector and One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualized specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria being the largest producer of eggs and the second largest producer of chicken meat in Africa, demand gap for eggs and meat stands at and outstrips current supply by 1.2Million Metric Tonnes and 140,000Metric Tonnes for meat and eggs respectively.\n\n\u201cOver the years, this demand gap has driven the smuggling of unhealthy frozen chicken into the country. To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

          "text": "The World Health Organization on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak, which has affected nearly 16,000 people in 72 countries, to be a global health emergency \u2014 the highest alarm it can sound.\n\n\u201cI have decided that the global #monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference.\n\nHe said a committee of experts who met on Thursday was unable to reach a consensus, so it fell on him to decide whether to trigger the highest alert possible.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region where we assess the risk as high,\u201d he added.\n\nMonkeypox has affected over 15,800 people in 72 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on July 20.\n\nA surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic.\n\nOn June 23, the WHO convened an emergency committee (EC) of experts to decide if monkeypox constitutes a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) \u2014 the UN health agency\u2019s highest alert level.\n\nBut a majority advised Tedros that the situation, at that point, had not met the threshold.\n\nThe second meeting was called on Thursday with case numbers rising further, where Tedros said he was worried.\n\n\u201cI need your advice in assessing the immediate and mid-term public health implications,\u201d Tedros told the meeting, which lasted more than six hours.\n\nA US health expert sounded a grim warning late on Friday.\n\n\u201cSince the last #monkeypox EC just weeks ago, we\u2019ve seen an exponential rise in cases. It\u2019s inevitable that cases will dramatically rise in the coming weeks & months. That\u2019s why @DrTedros must sound the global alarm,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cA failure to act will have grave consequences for global health.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Warning against discrimination \u2013\n\nA viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980.\n\nNinety-five percent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity, according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the New England Journal of Medicine \u2014 the largest research to date.\n\nOverall, 98 percent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and around a third were known to have visited sex-on-site venues such as sex parties or saunas within the previous month.\n\n\u201cThis transmission pattern represents both an opportunity to implement targeted public health interventions, and a challenge because in some countries, the communities affected face life-threatening discrimination,\u201d Tedros said earlier, citing concern that stigma and scapegoating could make the outbreak harder to track.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s drug watchdog on Friday recommended for approval the use of Imvanex, a smallpox vaccine, to treat monkeypox.\n\nImvanex, developed by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, has been approved in the EU since 2013 for the prevention of smallpox.\n\nIt was also considered a potential vaccine for monkeypox because of the similarity between the monkeypox virus and the smallpox virus.\n\nThe first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days.\n\nRashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.",

          "text": "The recent blame game between the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, and the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken a new twist with the latest jab coming from the former vice president\u2019s camp.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Atiku\u2019s media adviser, Paul Ibe, faulted an earlier statement by Tinubu\u2019s spokesman following a TV interview granted by the PDP flagbearer who is fondly called Waziri by his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe would like to challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour-long interview like the Waziri did, and if he is able to be as articulate and mentally present as our candidate, then he can talk,\u201d said Ibe.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat.\u201d\n\nThe controversy between both presidential hopefuls began when Atiku, in an interview with Arise TV on Friday morning, claimed he rejected Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the then Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform because he was against the ideology of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the interest of the country\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yaradua. That was the parting point,\u201d he had said.\n\nBut in his reaction barely a day after the interview aired, Tinubu countered the claims made by the PDP candidate whom he accused of demeaning himself by pandering to base prejudice at a moment Nigeria needs true leadership.\n\nRather, he explained that he and the ACN helped Atiku in 2007 after he was frozen out by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and forced out of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened to see such a man become unhinged from the truth,\u201d said a statement by the APC candidate\u2019s spokesman, Tunde Rahman. \u201cSo obsessed is he with his quest for office, Atiku is willing to render any form of untruth if he thinks it might gain him a single vote. Atiku may want to be president. However, all he has shown is that he is pathological.\u201d\n\nFollowing the latest reaction from Mr Ibe, Nigerians would only expect another dramatic twist in the blame game by both men.\n\nRead the full text of the statement by Akitu\u2019s spokesman below:",

Love of his own ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge.

Natasha Fouts, a spokeswoman for CalFire, said officials don\u2019t expect to contain the fire until next week.\n\nLocals described evacuating their homes with the flames approaching and one shoeless elderly man attempting to flee the blaze on Friday was rescued by firefighters after crashing his car into a ditch.\n\nThe scale of the evacuation means it is proving challenging to find accommodation for all those seeking shelter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full with evacuees,\u201d Alyssa Wildt, a local hotel owner, told the LA Times.\n\n\u201cToday we have a bunch of fire crews looking for rooms,\u201d Ms Wildt added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have them.

          "text": "Ukraine pressed ahead on Sunday with efforts to restart grain exports from Odesa and other Black Sea ports after a missile attack that cast doubt over whether Russia would honour a deal aimed at easing global food shortages caused by the war.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy denounced the strikes on Odesa as blatant \u201cbarbarism\u201d that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement Friday\u2019s deal, mediated by Turkey and the United Nations.\n\nHowever, a government minister said preparations to resume grain shipments were ongoing. Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted the Ukrainian military as saying the missiles had not significantly damaged the port.\n\nRussia said on Sunday its forces had hit a Ukrainian military boat in Odesa with missiles.\n\nThe deal signed by Moscow and Kyiv was hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough that would help curb soaring global food prices, but as the war entered its sixth month on Sunday there was no sign of a let-up in the fighting.\n\nWhile the main theatre of combat has been the eastern region of Donbas, Zelenskiy said in video posted late on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were moving \u201cstep by step\u201d into the occupied eastern Black Sea region of Kherson. read more\n\nUkraine\u2019s military on Sunday reported Russian shelling in numerous locations in the north, south and east, and again referred to Russian operations paving the way for an assault on Bakhmut in the Donbas.\n\nThe country\u2019s air force command said that it had shot down three Kalibr cruise missiles launched on Sunday morning by the Russian forces from the Black Sea and aimed at the western Khmelnytskiy region.\n\nThe strikes on Odesa drew condemnation from the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy. On Friday, United Nations officials had said they hoped the agreement would be operational in a few weeks.\n\nVideo released by the Ukrainian military showed firefighters battling a blaze on an unidentified boat moored alongside a tug boat. Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video or the date it was filmed.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defence minister said on Saturday Russian officials told Ankara that Moscow had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the strikes.\n\nOn Sunday, though, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Russian forces had hit a Ukrainian military boat in of Odesa with high-precision missiles. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has not commented.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, two Russian Kalibr missiles hit the area of a pumping station at the port and two others were shot down by air defence forces.\n\nUkrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ignat said the missiles were fired from warships in the Black Sea near Crimea.\n\nSuspilne quoted Ukraine\u2019s southern military command as saying the port\u2019s grain storage area was not hit.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately there are wounded. The port\u2019s infrastructure was damaged,\u201d said Odesa region governor Maksym Marchenko.\n\nBut Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook that \u201cwe continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports\u201d.\n\nThe deal would restore grain shipments from the three reopened ports to pre-war levels of 5 million tonnes a month, U.N. officials said.\n\nThe strikes appeared to violate Friday\u2019s deal, which would allow safe passage in and out of Ukrainian ports.\n\nZelenskiy vowed to do everything possible to acquire air defence systems able to shoot down missiles like those that hit Odesa.\n\nA blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet since Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion has trapped tens of millions of tonnes of grain and stranded many ships.\n\nThis has worsened global supply chain bottlenecks. Along with Western sanctions on Russia, it has stoked food and energy price inflation. Russia and Ukraine are major global wheat suppliers, and a global food crisis has pushed some 47 million people into \u201cacute hunger,\u201d according to the World Food Programme.\n\nMoscow denies responsibility for the food crisis, blaming Western sanctions for slowing its food and fertiliser exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its ports.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the attack on Odesa \u201ccasts serious doubt on the credibility of Russia\u2019s commitment to yesterday\u2019s deal.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the strikes and said full implementation of the deal was imperative.\n\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusai Akar said in a statement: \u201cThe Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack \u2026 The fact that such an incident took place right after the agreement we made yesterday really worried us.\u201d\n\nUkraine has mined waters near its ports as part of its war defences, but under the deal pilots will guide ships along safe channels.\n\nA Joint Coordination Center staffed by members of the four parties to the agreement are to monitor ships passing the Black Sea to Turkey\u2019s Bosporus Strait and off to world markets. All sides agreed on Friday there would be no attacks on these entities.\n\nPutin calls the war a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at demilitarising Ukraine and rooting out dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and the West call this a baseless pretext for an aggressive land grab.",

          "text": "The European Union (EU) has intensified pressure on Nigeria to supply gas to Europe as it attempts to wean itself off Russian gas on the back of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war with Ukraine.\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, at the weekend suggested a multi-faceted approach to resolving the massive oil theft, vandalism and outright sabotage of Nigeria\u2019s oil facilities which have combined to hobble Nigeria\u2019s ability to meet its crude production quota.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Sylva by yet another delegation from Europe led by the Deputy Director General, EU Energy Platform Task Force, Mr Mathew Baldwin, the leader of the delegation, reiterated the EU\u2019s commitment to making the ongoing gas projects a reality.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to be working with you in a big way\u2026the more the security situation can be improved in the Niger Delta region, the more investment we will see,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the visit was part of an effort to establish a new sustainable partnership and renewed investment drive with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of supporting such efforts. The more there are improved investments in the Niger-Delta and the minister is leading in this direction, the more the investments will come in\u201d, he restated.\n\nA major area of collaboration, the parties agreed on is the ongoing Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Project and the Trans Sahara Gas Pipelines (TSGP) project regarded as one of the world\u2019s longest offshore pipelines and is expected to transport gas from Nigeria through Morocco to Europe.\n\nDespite its intention to raise gas supply, Nigeria has been unable to do so as a result of declining funding, attacks on upstream facilities and theft of petroleum products.\n\nBut Sylva while speaking during a visit by the delegation from Europe, advocated the deployment of technology, security forces, community collaboration and increased government action to halt the menace.\n\nIt would be one of the several visits in the last few months to Nigerian authorities, including the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) by officials from Europe.\n\nThe minister called for collaboration with the EU in the areas of security, technology deployment, project financing and more private sector participation to meet the country\u2019s plan of stepping into the void created by the aftermath of the Russian-Ukraine altercation.\n\nHe frowned on the decision by the EU and Western nations to withdraw investment in fossil fuels, insisting that hydrocarbons will continue to be relevant while gas would be used as a transition fuel in the coming years.\n\nSylva, therefore, appealed to the delegation to impress upon their businessmen and financial institutions to debottleneck the process of obtaining loans and other sources of funding to ramp up the exploration of oil and gas.\n\nThe minister recalled that the delegation was earlier in the Niger Delta to see for themselves the situation, assuring that the region would be secured for oil and gas investments to continue to thrive while the country\u2019s production quota would be raised.\n\n\u201cSecurity is one area of cooperation with the EU. They went to the Niger Delta to see the security situation for themselves. Part of the solution is technology deployment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always advocated for collaboration in this regard. We have to have a four-legged approach. We have to have the government, security agencies and communities working together. We also need to have the technology. We\u2019re discussing with the EU how we can collaborate on developing technology.\n\n\u201cWe have lots of gas projects like the Trans-Saharan gas pipeline and so on and we need the environment to be conducive to achieve all this. The project will deliver gas to Europe in a few years to come,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe minister assured the EU delegation of the federal government\u2019s commitment to deepening investment in gas since it had been adopted as Nigeria\u2019s energy transition fuel and expressed confidence that the EU had given a lot of commitment in that regard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re together on the same page with the rest of the world in using gas as the energy transition fuel. We\u2019re working together in technology development and financing.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s the private sector that invests but the EU is responsible for policy direction and they have shown a lot of commitments. We\u2019ve been having discussions. This is not the first and won\u2019t be the last. it\u2019s a good beginning for us,\u201d the minister explained.\n\nPort Harcourt to Begin Refining of 60,000bpd in 2023\n\nMeanwhile, the Managing Director of the Port Harcourt Refining Company Limited, Mr Ahmed Dikko, has assured that the rehabilitation of the old Port Harcourt Refinery with a refining capacity of 60,000 barrels per day will be completed and put to use by the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHe gave the assurance when the House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on the state of the country\u2019s refineries visited the facility in Rivers State for an on-the-spot assessment of the $1.5 billion rehabilitation project of the facility.\n\nDikko said the old Port Harcourt refinery, referred to as Area Five, would be the first of three phases of the project.\n\nHe said by the time the entire project is completed by the end of 2024, the facility would have a refining capacity of 210 bpd.\n\nDikko expressed confidence that they would stick to the timelines and within the cost approved for the project.\n\nHe said despite costing more, some of the equipment required for the rehabilitation had to be air freighted to ensure that they stick as much as possible to the schedule that they have.\n\n\u201cWe plan to finish Area 5 by the first quarter of next year, so we can begin to run it. It is the old refinery. It is a 60, 000 barrels per day capacity plant and it is a priority for us at this point. The other parts of the refinery would come a few months after that.\n\n\u201cWe are on track and managing the process very well and would continue to do the best we can at all times to ensure that we meet these expectations we put on ourselves so we all would be proud of all these activities and begin to have some refining capacity in Port Harcourt,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives for their support.\n\nChairman of the House Ad-Hoc Committee, Hon. Ganiyu Johnson, who was conducted around the facility along with his members by the MD expressed satisfaction with the level of work.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far on behalf of my committee members, we are satisfied with the level of work because we did not expect this level of performance when we left Abuja. But after going round we are satisfied with the level of performance.\n\n\u201cNigerians should bear with the company. We know that the solution to all oil subsidies is refineries. The oil subsidy would be a thing of the past. We should be able to reduce it to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cWe owe Nigerians the duty to ensure this place is working. Because if these refineries are not working, we would continue to suffer and God forbid we hope it would not get to a stage an average man cannot buy fuel and that is why we want to encourage you and support you and make sure you complete this refinery. Even if it is just Port Harcourt for now, it means we would be able to deliver 210, 000 bpd.\u201d\n\nHe urged the MD to fast-track the completion of the refinery and make sure it is delivered on schedule.\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "The European Union (EU) has intensified pressure on Nigeria to supply gas to Europe as it attempts to wean itself off Russian gas on the back of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war with Ukraine.\nA major area of collaboration, the parties agreed on is the ongoing Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Project and the Trans Sahara Gas Pipelines (TSGP) project regarded as one of the world\u2019s longest offshore pipelines and is expected to transport gas from Nigeria through Morocco to Europe.\nDespite its intention to raise gas supply, Nigeria has been unable to do so as a result of declining funding, attacks on upstream facilities and theft of petroleum products.\nThe project will deliver gas to Europe in a few years to come,\u201d he noted.\nDikko said the old Port Harcourt refinery, referred to as Area Five, would be the first of three phases of the project.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Afenifere, PANDEF, Ohanaeze Reject New Water Resources Bill",
          "text": "The pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) have kicked against the recent reintroduction of the widely-rejected Water Resources Bill in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Minister of Water Resources, Mr Suleiman Adamu and a clique of lawmakers at the National Assembly have been desperately pushing for the passage of the bill which was rejected by the eighth National Assembly following public outcry.\n\nTheir relentless campaign to ensure the passage of the bill has fuelled speculations that they have ulterior motives.\n\nOne of the offensive provisions in the bill is that while there is popular agitation for resource control and devolution of powers to the states and local governments, the bill seeks to compel Nigerians to pay tax to the federal government like oil and gas operators before they drill boreholes in the backyards.\n\nThe bill also seeks to cede ownership of waterways, Benue Valley and river banks to the federal government apparently for the resettlement of foreign herdsmen.\n\nAfter the bill was rejected by the eighth National Assembly, it was recently reintroduced in the ninth House of Representatives.\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom had described its \u201creintroduction as \u201cevil\u201d and part of the agenda of the federal government to seize land from the 36 states of the federation.\n\n\u201cI want to urge Benue indigenes to rise and reject the bill because it is targeted at our ancestral heritage. In their attempt to take over our inheritance they came with Ruga and a cattle colony among others. But the people behind this plot can rest assured that Benue will resist any attempt to take over our land and water resources through any guise.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bill is an evil bill by the federal government to take over the river banks and allow herdsmen from other parts of Africa to take over the Benue Valley.\n\nAlso reacting, the PANDEF, through its spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, told THISDAY at the weekend that it would continue to reject the bill, which it described as an obnoxious, draconian, imperialistic and unnecessary evil.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Niger Delta region, particularly of the South-south geopolitical zone had rejected the Water Resources Bill from the beginning, and our position has not changed; it remains rejected.\n\n\u201cThat bill is not only obnoxious but draconic and imperialistic. It is an unnecessary evil. That was why it attracted wild condemnation when it was first introduced. The eighth National Assembly heeded the voice of the people, by throwing it out. It was likewise stepped down when it was reintroduced in this ninth National Assembly in 2020, following similar denunciation by citizens.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, troubling that the Bill has again been introduced in the House of Representatives, more so, with less than a year to the end of the session of this National Assembly. The questions we would want the sponsors of the Bill to answer are; why the insistence on this Bill? Whose interest are they trying to satisfy?\u201d PANDEF queried.\n\nIt said it was most absurd and callous that in the face of increased clamour for the devolution of powers to the federating units, the federal government was plotting to accrue further powers to itself through this abhorrent bill.\n\n\u201cDo we need to further apprise that our oil and gas resources have been plundered, over the years, by the federal government and its agents; our hitherto luxurious ecosystem has been decimated and basic means of livelihood destroyed, with little or nothing to show, in terms of the development of our communities and improvements in the living conditions of the people? Yet, they now want to control our water resources; the people of the Niger Delta Region say a big no to it,\u201d PANDEF added.\n\nThe Niger Delta leaders urged the members of the House of Representatives and Senators not to allow themselves to be used by self-seeking officials and groups to secure legislation that would exacerbate the tension and crisis in the country.\n\n\u201cWe caution, in particular, the federal lawmakers of South-south extraction, and indeed, of the entire Southern and Middle Belt regions not to support a bill that is anti-peace, dangerous and that could destroy the fragile unity of this country,\u201d PANDEF said.\n\nPANDEF also described the claim by the sponsors of the bill that southern governors are now in support of the bill as illusory and preposterous, adding that such a claim should be discarded.\n\nOn its part, Afenifere has also kicked against the reintroduction of the bill at the National Assembly.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Comrade Jare Ajayi, told THISDAY in Ibadan, Oyo State capital that the bill was another way of bringing RUGA through the back door, describing it as unacceptable.\n\nAccording to him, the reintroduction of the bill was to deprive the indigenous people of their land, insisting that this is not in the best interest of the ethnic nationalities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe reintroduction of the Water Resources Bill is unacceptable to Afenifere; this is because it is another way of depriving the indigenous people of their land and this is not in the best interest of the various ethnic nationalities given the experience with the federal government.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo has also condemned the bill, describing it as completely obnoxious.\n\nThe organisation\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Dr Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia told THISDAY that the bill is completely at variance with present national realities.\n\n\u201cAt a time we are canvassing for devolution of powers to states and local government areas, some people are still toying with the idea of controlling river banks and all that. It\u2019s so sad.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but another RUGA. The same way we resisted the bill the last time, we are even more resolute now. It is unacceptable and totally out of tune with realities,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further asked the governors and members of the National Assembly from the South-east to completely resist and reject the said bill.\n\n\u201cOur position is clear and has not changed. We say no to the bill and we are urging our governors and federal lawmakers to also reject it. Apart from the South-east, political leaders from the South-west, South-south and North-central should also reject this obnoxious bill,\u201d the organisation insisted.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan",
