          "title": "States bank on PPP projects as cash crunch bites harder",
          "text": "States afraid of negative effect of mass retrenchment on 2023 political agenda\n\nWe\u2019re doing PPP already, some projects are financed by World Bank, says Ekiti\n\nWe\u2019ll fish out ghost workers \u2013 Bauchi\n\nWe are cutting down overheads \u2013 Enugu\n\nMany state governments have started reducing their overhead costs as part of measures aimed at addressing the dwindling funds from the federation account.\n\nState officials, who disclosed this in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Sunday, ruled out sacking workers or slashing salaries in order to reduce the states\u2019 wage bills.\n\nSome of them also said that the governments had embarked on the private-public partnership to finance capital projects that had the potential of yielding revenue.\n\nThe officials said states that had yet to start the PPP, were also planning to embrace it to finance projects.\n\nThey confided in our correspondents that no matter how tight the finances of their states were, governors would not contemplate sacking workers because of the possible political backlash.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, in a letter dated April 26, 2021, informed federal and state governments about its dwindling contribution to the federation account as a result of the bloated fuel subsidy.\n\nThe corporation also indicated that it would not make any remittance for the April and May Federal Account Allocation Committee after paying fuel subsidy from its revenue.\n\nAs a solution to the dwindling revenue, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, at its meeting on May 20, called for immediate removal of fuel subsidy and suggested that the pump price of petrol should be N385 per litre.\n\nDespite the governors\u2019 recommendation, the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the NNPC, Kennie Obateru, in an interview with The PUNCH on Monday last week, ruled out the removal of fuel subsidy until the conclusion of negotiations with the organised labour.\n\nTo compound the woes of the states, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele, after the CBN\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting in Abuja on Tuesday, insisted that the bank would start deducting budget support loans given to states.\n\nAt the National Economic Council meeting in April, the governors had requested that the repayment of the loans borrowed from the CBN, which ought to start this month, be deferred.\n\nOn Sunday, a top official of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, who confided in one of our correspondents, said, \u201cExcept for a governor like El-Rufai (of Kaduna State), who is courageous enough to take decisions without thinking about the political implications for himself or his party, no governor will contemplate laying off workers less than two years to the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cRecall that one of the major causes of Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s failure to win second term in 2003 was the reform that he carried out in the civil service as well as the teaching service. Some teachers were laid off because of the relevance of their subjects. Some civil servants lost their jobs because their certificates were not genuine.\n\n\u201cAlthough the old man is a good manager of people and resources, he lost the 2003 election partly because of the reform, which was in the overall interest of the state.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re financing projects through PPP, IGR \u2013 Bauchi\n\nThe Bauchi State Commissioner of Budget and Economic Planning, Dr Aminu Gamawa, in a text message sent to one of our correspondents, said the state government would not sack workers.\n\nHe, however, said the state government would continue fishing out ghost workers in the payroll.\n\nThe commissioner stated, \u201cThe economies of Nigeria and Bauchi State are not in good shape. That is why some states are reducing their workers. In Bauchi, we are approaching the problem in a creative manner.\n\n\u201cInstead of sacking workers, we are focusing on ensuring that the payroll and the nominal roll of the state are sanitised to prevent fraud and corruption. This will ensure that ghost workers and unproductive workers who are not adding value are fished out. This will enable the state to make some savings.\n\n\u201cWe are also taking proactive and creative measures to increase our internally generated revenue. This will provide the state with more resources to implement projects. Most of the projects that we are currently implementing in Bauchi are financed through the internally generated revenue and other creative ways like the private public partnership.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that the role of the government is not to make people dependent on the government for handouts. The role of the government is to create enabling environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to prosper, and create jobs, wealth and fight poverty.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that workers are paid their legitimate salaries on time, but we will also ensure that the government gets value for the money it is spending.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Enugu State Commissioner for Information, Mr Chidi Aroh, said the state was working hard to cut down overheads.\n\nAroh stated, \u201cHe (the state governor) is also working hard to see how he will cut overheads in the state.\n\n\u201c I am sure in a couple of weeks or so we are going to come out with a new principle to cut down a lot of overheads in the state because the economy is bad and government must take the primary responsibility of providing security and welfare of the people.\u201d\n\nIn Sokoto State, Governor Aminu Tambuwal also said the state government was not considering sacking workers.\n\nHe stated, , \u201cInstead an agreement would be brokered, when the need arises, to source for funds, we will tax elected officials and political appointees.\n\n\u201cSuch funds and taxes would be used to pay the civil servants pending when the situation improves and the deductions made would be repaid.\n\n\u201cWe give priority to prompt payment of salaries and pensions. The state government is doing its best in addressing the challenges of gratuity as well as other allowances to the workers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Kogi State Government said that it had no plan to either sack workers or reduce salaries of its workforce.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Communication Strategy, Kingsley Fanwo told one of our correspondents on the telephone on Sunday that the state government was still committed to its agreement with the state organised labour.\n\nPPP has taken Ekiti this far in development \u2013 Commissioner\n\nIn Ekiti State, the Commissioner for Information, Mr Akinbowale Omole, said private public participation in projects execution had produced a lot for the state in terms of development.\n\nOmole, who said that Ekiti was resolute not to sack workers despite the present dwindling resources, said the state was, however, reviewing the financial situation with a view to determine the way forward.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are doing the PPP already. There are some projects that the World Bank is financing. There are some that the European Union is financing. We are doing that already and that is why we have been able to go this far in our developmental feat in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are still reviewing the financial situation that we are going through now, there is still no indication that it will continue for long period of time. We are still looking at it whether it will be a short-term problem or long term.\n\n\u201cIf it is short term, I want to believe that we will still weather it. But if it extends too long, then we will sit back again and review the situation to see what will be done,\u201d he said, while speaking on sustainability of the projects and as well meeting obligations to workers.\n\nOn efforts already taken by the state to address the situation, Omole said, \u201cWe run a serious government here and we set our priorities. There was a stakeholders\u2019 meeting involving every stakeholder \u2013 the organised labour, the two state-owned universities, the political appointees and various groups that participate in revenue generation and share out of the revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at everything together and we have put some things before the stakeholders. The advice of various groups is coming in as per what the government should do in the circumstance and it is only a collation of these suggestions that will now determine the way forward. As I speak with you, we are still getting feedback from various groups,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nWe hope we won\u2019t get to the level of retrenchment \u2013 Osun\n\nAlso, the Osun State Commissioner for Works, Remi Omowaiye, expressed hope that poor state of finances would not degenerate further and reach the level that the administration would consider sacking workers.\n\nOmowaiye, who declared that because of repayment of loans taken by the previous administrations, the state received the least amount from the federation account.\n\nHe further said the administration had been performing its statutory obligations because of the financial ingenuity of the governor.\n\nWhen contacted, Osun State Nigeria Labour Congress Chairman, Jacob Adekomi, simply replied, \u201cWhen we get to the bridge, we know how to cross it. Our national headquarters usually take decision on such issues.\u201d\n\nPPP is at the heart of all we do \u2013 Ogun govt\n\nThe Ogun State Government said that it would not drop any capital project, neither would it sack works despite the dwindling allocation from the Federal Government .\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Kunle Somorin, who stated this in an interview with one of our correspondents on Sunday, said the state government was creatively allocating resources to meet the developmental needs.\n\nSomorin added that public private partnership would be prioritised to ensure the needs were met .\n\nHe said \u201cThe PPP is at the heart of all we do. No capital project will be dropped. We are creatively allocating resources to meet our developmental needs. Ogun won\u2019t slash workers salaries.\n\n\u201cOgun is solvent. We won\u2019t sack for lack of funds. The people are the essence of governance. Anybody sacked must have undergone a fair and due process after committing service infractions.\u201d\n\nRecall that there was a crisis in Kaduna State, two weeks ago, when workers embarked on a strike because of the decision of the state government to sack workers in order to improve its finances.\n\n\u201dCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, has raised the alarm that 119 passengers from high-risk countries have refused to be isolated after coming back into the country.\n\nAbayomi, in a statement on Sunday appealed to the families of those who refused to be isolated to return them for testing.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince the commencement of the new guidelines and the ban on non-Nigerians travelling from three countries (India, Brazil and Turkey) into Nigeria, Lagos State has recorded 568 in-bound passengers, who have been permitted to enter Nigeria from these three countries. We have isolated 433 passengers in our various accredited hotels and facilities; 262 are in isolation and 154 passengers have been discharged with a negative COVID-19 test. Nine have tested positive to COVID-19 and successfully isolated to prevent community transmission. Of the remaining 135 passengers, 119 have refused isolation and 16 are unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cThe families of those that have refused to be isolated should appeal to their loved ones to return for testing and isolation.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner added that all passengers that had been confirmed absconders would have their passports deactivated for a minimum of one year if Nigerian; and if foreign, would have their resident permits cancelled and deported as stated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\nAbayomi also disclosed the state government\u2019s intention to partner the private sector and Federal Government in ramping up vaccination in the state.\n\n\u201cOn May 28, 2021, we commenced the administration of the second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine. Given the requirement for achieving herd immunity, Lagos State still needs to vaccinate about 14 million people to reach this target.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government is considering several channels, including discussions with the Federal Government and the private sector, to ramp up the vaccination numbers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nOver 2,000 oil palm farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states now have access to digitized financial services, thanks to a partnership between Releaf, a raw material procurement & logistics platform that is making it easy for crops to move from farm to factory, and OnePipe, a digital gateway enabling financial services.\n\nOver 65 percent of Nigerians are outside the financial services envelope, with millions unbanked or under-banked. The combination of COVID-19 disruptions and the widening digital divide in the rural and underserved areas has threatened the attainment of financial inclusion targets in Nigeria. This partnership between Releaf and OnePipe is thus a welcome initiative to the National Financial Inclusion Strategy and provides opportunities for thousands of rural farmers across Nigeria\u2019s South-South region.\n\nSpeaking on the collaboration, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer for Releaf, Uzoma Ayogu, said; \u201cSince inception, Releaf has empowered over 1,000 farmers to supply over 10 million kilograms of quality crops to various food factories.\n\nWhile disbursements to our farmers have been largely cash-based, we now have access to digitized fund disbursement via embedded, customised accounts, provisioned by OnePipe, to drive financial inclusion of previously financially excluded farmers in the digital economy. As a result, we can provide increased funding to farmers in a more seamless, scalable, and safe manner. We are also exploring other products like insurance and other services leveraging OnePipe\u2019s infrastructure and strategic partnerships with an array of Financial Institutions.\n\nThe embedded customised accounts for the farmers are provisioned leveraging OnePipe\u2019s partner bank APIs. They are opened and operated via USSD and *PWA (Progressive Web App) channels and branded as Releaf Wallet for ease of adoption by the farmers. As full-utility accounts, farmers can receive inflow from any bank/channel and can transfer funds to any Nigerian bank account; they can also access readily available services such as airtime top-up (self and third party), savings/investments and various loan options. The loan options are configured such that consistent usage of the Releaf wallet by the farmers results in a correspondingly increasing credit line.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s Founder and Chief Plumber, Ope Adeoye described the partnership with Releaf as \u201can exciting opportunity to co-create value with Releaf. Releaf is reviving agricultural infrastructure and crafting a sustainable path to prosperity for farmers who previously did not have commensurate return for their labour\u201d. According to him, \u201cworking with Releaf was inevitable as the company\u2019s vision to transform Africa\u2019s agricultural future by making decentralized food processing scaleable coincides with OnePipe\u2019s social mandate to drive financial inclusion through technology for all \u2013 including the 700M+ smallholder farmers on the continent.\u201d\n\nOnePipe\u2019s platform provides a single gateway that aggregates financial services from industry leaders and combines them in unique ways to create new brand propositions that help organisations reduce time to market by embedding financial services within their products. OnePipe is at the vanguard of the embedded finance movement in Sub-Saharan Africa and has assisted companies like Releaf to provide seamless digital financial services to their partners. In addition to the ongoing partnership with Releaf, OnePipe is also working with key players in the Retail, FMCG and Asset Management space to facilitate embedded finance within their existing offerings.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Asks IGP to immediately dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nTHE South-East caucus of the Senate and the House of Representatives Sunday condemned attacks and continuous killings in the South East geo- Political zone of the country.\n\nIn a statement, the National lawmakers said that they were surprised that these are taking place in the zone against the backdrop that the Igbos are not known to kill or waste lives, adding that the people of the South East are not known for this unfortunate violent disposition, no matter the provocation.\n\nAccording to them, the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Usman Baba should immediately dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen who are determined to create a state of anarchy in the Southeast.\n\nThe statement was signed by for Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu for Enugu State, Senate Minority Leader, Sen. Enyinnaya Abaribe for Abia State; Sen. Sam Egwu for Ebonyi State; Sen. Frank Ibezim for Imo State and Sen. Stella Oduah for Anambra State.\n\nOthers are Hon Toby Okechukwu Enugu State;; Hon Nkiruka Onyejiocha Abia State; Hon Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu Anambra State; Hon Jerry Alagboso Imo State and Hon Sylvester Ogbaga Ebonyi State.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe, the South-East Caucus of the NASS, as leaders and major stakeholders in the region, have observed with surprise the sudden spike in violence in the region known for its calm, love and peaceful disposition to visitors irrespective of tribe and religion.\n\n\u201cWe have had cause always to deploy the instrumentalities of the institution of state to alert the government of Nigeria about some of the vexed issues of injustice, inequity and obvious marginalisation of the South East in governance structure. Nonetheless, we have not lost hope that the authorities will eventually do the right thing for the continued peaceful coexistence of all people in a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are worried over recent developments in the South East, which has thrown the zone into violence and confusion.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIgbos are not known to kill or waste lives. Igbos are not known for this unfortunate violent disposition, no matter the provocation.\n\n\u201cWe note the increasing agitation for restructuring of Nigeria and increasing separatist agitations across the country due to perceived and real issues of marginalisation. On these issues, we, the leaders across-board, have consistently cautioned that such agitations must be strictly in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and must be peaceful and devoid of violence.\n\n\u201cThe Southeast Caucus of NASS commiserates with all who have lost loved ones, friends and colleagues in these unfortunate incidents and trust that our great country is resilient enough to weather and survive the current challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cWe therefore condemn in its totality the attack on the security personnel and their formations, particularly on the police, INEC, courts and correctional facilities. It is unacceptable and must never for whatever reason be condoned.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Inspector General of Police to dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen determined to create a state of anarchy in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has become necessary in the circumstance because of the magnitude of the attacks.

So, trying to amend a product that is not sellable, trying to amend a product that is not worthy, one day, the whole product will collapse. What we just need is a brand new constitution. I mean, a people oriented constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot this National Assembly or senate we have. These people, they\u2019re not after the interests of the Nation. You can imagine, they want to create more States when we are thinking of merging States together. They\u2019re thinking of creating more States.\n\n\u201cThese people, they\u2019re not in touch with the people. They\u2019re not in touch with the people of their Constituency.

They don\u2019t know what they want. So, when they dangle eom few naira in the face of these hungry constituents, the people are confused.\n\n\u201cSo, what we really need is a kind of National Conference irrespective of the Senate or our representative. It is for us to have a conference of all ethinc nationalities and within six months, let\u2019s draft an acceptable constitution. A brand new constitution for the country. If not, left for the Senate and the house of representatives, they will not do it because they\u2019re pursuing their own personal interests above national interests.\n\n\u201cIf somebody says we should create more States. They\u2019re talking about 50 states. How can they sustain 50 States when some of the existing States do not have money to pay their workers? When some of the States do not have money left to carry out development projects? They don\u2019t have it and you are creating more States. I don\u2019t think there is sense in that. It\u2019s just the same old constitution that\u2019s handed over to us vide the Decree\u201d\n\nMr. Ikimi also noted that in the new constitution, the people must look at how they will be structured.\n\nHe stressed that Nigeria is structured to fail and nothing good can come out of it whether through Alteration of the existing constitution because of the way it is currently structured.\n\nHe said whether the constitution is altered 100% nothing will come out of it because a few people sat down and drafted the constitution and not the people of Nigeria in a national conference.\n\nWhile noting that Nigeria cannot develop, Mr. Ikimi said something has to be done so Nigerians can have a befitting constitution for the country to move forward.",

          "text": "Gunmen suspected to be herdsmen on Sunday attacked some Ebonyi communities, killing at least 30 persons.\n\nThe gunmen attacked Odoke, Ndiobasi and Obakotara communities in Ebonyi local government area.\n\nSources in the area said the gunmen struck the three communities around 3am on Sunday morning.\n\nThe communities share boundary with Ado local government area in Benue State.\n\nA resident in the area, Uchenna Okpokwu said the herdsmen invaded with guns and machetes.\n\n\u201cThey came into Ndiobasi village and started slaughtering the people. After slaughtering them, they entered Odoke, from that Odoke, they went to Obapta\u201d.\n\n\u201cCurrently, people that were slaughtered in Ndiobasi are up to 30 according to the video clips on the incident but Odoke and Obapta are very far and nobody was able to entered those two villages to capture those that were killed.\n\n\u201cWhen I received call from one of my villagers over the attack, he told me that the herdsmen are currently at Ojaba forest and that place is their hideout because there is no other way for them to escape.\n\n\u201cThe herdsmen are currently in that forest as at the time I was called on phone\u201d\n\n\u201cI was told our local government Chairman went with some security men but couldn\u2019t get to the affected villages. If there is a way security agents will be sent to the affected villages, it will be good.\n\n\u201cCurrently, I have been trying to reach my family members on phone but their lines are not through and all of them are in the village,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother resident, Onyibe Jeremiah lamented no action was taken to protect the communities despite earlier warnings of thw herdsmen impending attacks.\n\nH\u00e9 said: \u201cOne young man from Enugu state that saw the herdsmen when they were coming into the Ebonyi villages made the voice call that went viral to alert the state but it appears that it was ignored which was why these attacks were recorded despite the alert.\n\n\u201cNobody took that voice serious and the herdsmen came and killed not less than 30 people now. They are currently attacking more villages\u201d\n\nThe Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team (AMURT) confirmed two children were killed while being taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nIt said it has scrambled a team to the area to help in treatment and evacuation of victims.\n\n\u201cTerrible scenes at Ohagelode Health Center this morning. An attack on an Izzi village inside Benue State, allegedly by herdsmen, resulted in many casualties.\n\n\u201cMany were carried all the way to Ohagelode Health Center. The Uloanwu Ambulance was called and eleven 11 person\u2019s, six adults and five children, were transported to AEFUTHA in Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cSadly two children already died after reaching AEFUTHA. An AMURT team of doctors, lead by Dr. Omogo, the MD of AMURT has rushed to Ohagelode. We are trying to support the wounded carried to AEFUTHA, the statement by AMURT West Africa\u201d, the statement said.\n\nChairman of Ebonyi local government area, Chinyere Nwaogbaga confirmed the incident.\n\nShe said she went to the area and helped to evacuate many of the residents from the area to hospital.\n\n\u201cYes, the communities are Izzi(a clan in Ebonyi) speaking communities but they are geographically located in Benue. Since they are indigenes of Ebonyi though located in Benue, the State governor directed we go and bring them to hospital and treat them and also give them relive materials\u201d.\n\nShe said more buses have been sent to the area by the local government, Ebonyi Speaker and the State Government to evacuate more victims.",

They said the investigation has become necessary in the current circumstances as a result of the magnitude of recent attacks.\n\nIn a statement signed by chairman of the South East caucus, Ike Ekweremadu, Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, among others, siad majority of Igbo are opposed to any form of violence in furtherance of any cause.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cWe urge the Inspector General of Police to dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen determined to create a state of anarchy in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has become necessary in the circumstance because of the magnitude of the attacks.

Security operatives must remember, at all times, that the majority of Igbos are opposed to any form of violence in furtherance of any cause.\n\n\u201cWe, the South-East Caucus of the NASS, as leaders and major stakeholders in the region, have observed with surprise the sudden spike in violence in the region known for its calm, love and peaceful disposition to visitors irrespective of tribe and religion.\n\n\u201cWe have had cause always to deploy the instrumentalities of the institution of state to alert the government of Nigeria about some of the vexed issues of injustice, inequity and obvious marginalisation of the South East in governance structure. Nonetheless, we have not lost hope that the authorities will eventually do the right thing for the continued peaceful coexistence of all people in a united Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we are worried over recent developments in the South East, which has thrown the zone into violence and confusion. Igbos are not known to kill or waste lives. Igbos are not known for this unfortunate violent disposition, no matter the provocation.\n\n\u201cWe note the increasing agitation for restructuring of Nigeria and increasing separatist agitations across the country due to perceived and real issues of marginalisation.

We are gravely concerned about persistent attacks on the rule of law. Millions of people are falling into preventable poverty, and live in a state of insecurity. This government\u2019s effort to use anniversary celebrations to deflect attention from its record of assault on the rule of law isn\u2019t going to work. Instead, it should use the occasion to create a rule of law-friendly environment that would make Nigerians safer. Systematically breaching the rule of law is not a sign of strength. Your administration should urgently comply with Nigeria\u2019s constitutional and international obligations to respect the rule of law, if it is not to leave behind a legacy of impunity and attacks on the rule of law, and ultimately, on the system of protection of human rights after your tenure in 2023.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nSouthern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to address Nigerians on the various challenges facing the country, including insecurity.\n\nNational leader of the body, Chief Edwin Clark, stated this at a meeting in Abuja where he expressed the worry on the state of the nation.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going in Nigeria? Some are asking for secession, others for a breakup, others running a unitary system of government. Time is moving fast and there is the need to state our position very clearly to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMr. President is not an emperor, he is not a king, he is not a monarch, he is a politician. He should come out and meet some of us who where here even when he was an ordinary soldier. This country belongs to all of us, the north alone or the south alone cannot rule this country.\u201d\n\nClark said Nigeria is running a unitary system of government, insisting it is time to restructure it. He said though zoning is not constitutional, it is conventional and was needed to keep the country together. He also stressed the need for the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the south since the north would have had eight years at the end of Buhari\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cWe want a brand new constitution. Any amendment of the constitution, I have no confidence in it. We are here for two things: Nigeria should be restructured. President Buhari once said if we don\u2019t kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria. I say if we don\u2019t restructure, Nigeria will die. Secession is not the answer. Secondly, we want zoning to continue. We want the 2023 presidency zoned to the south.\u201d\n\nIn a communique read by Dr. Pogu Bitrus, National President, Middle Belt Forum at the end of the meeting, the leaders resolved and called on both the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the All Progressive Congress (APC) and other political parties to zone the Presidency in 2023 to the south.\n\nThey also enjoined political stakeholders from the south not to be lured into the unpatriotic step of seeking such other positions as national chairmen and vice president of the main political parties, but join forces to demand and ensure the Presidency moves to the South in 2023.\n\nThe elders also called on President Buhari to heed calls for a national dialogue to trash out contending issues facing the country.\n\nThey reiterated that like other stakeholders, they were opposed to the use of federal or state resources to fund private cattle business other than providing enabling environment for owners of such businesses.\n\nThe group also called on the Federal Government to declare a national emergency on security and urgently come up with proactive strategies to restore peace and security to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIf the security situation is not dealt with and banditry stopped or reduced to the barest minimum, it would not be feasible to have proper elections in 2023.\u201d It condemned the cavalier attitude of the Federal Government towards the resolutions of the governors of southern states at their meeting, held in Asaba, Delta State on May 11 as it pertains to ban on open grazing and restructuring. It also reaffirmed its commitment to the unity of Nigeria, which it said must only be sustained on the principles of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nThe communique was signed by Chief Clark, Leader; Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Leader of Afenifere; Prof George Obiozor, President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide; Dr. Bitrus, National President, Middle Belt Forum; and Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, National Chairman PANDEF.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Geoffrey Anyanwu Enugu, Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nTension and anxiety have pervaded the whole of the South East and parts of South South states ahead of the sit-at-home ordered by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB).\n\nPro-Biafra groups had shifted the observance which is usually on May 30 to today because this year\u2019s anniversary fell on Sunday. However, many of their members used yesterday for prayers in the churches.\n\nIPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had warned, at the weekend, that any person that flouted the directive in the region would have him or herself to blame.\n\nSimilarly, MASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu, yesterday, warned the Nigeria security agencies that their threats would not hold waters. He advised them to steer clear during the commemoration of the Biafra day anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe can never be cowed or intimidated by empty threats of cowardice security agencies. Sit-at-home exercise must hold tomorrow. Our people will once again prove they want Biafra. The declaration of Biafra independence by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu must always stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThis came as the various police commands threatened to crush any form of procession or gathering relating to Biafra today.\n\nIn Onitsha, tension started building up on Saturday, May 29, following an alleged shooting of soldiers at Ihiala Local Government Area of the state by suspected gunmen which caused gridlock for hours at the Onitsha bridgehead due to tight security check there.\n\nThere was show-of-force patrol by joint-security forces along roads and streets of Onitsha and its environs, ostensibly to instil fear in anybody trying to cause breach of peace and breakdown of law and order.\n\nWithin the week, there was rush by people to the markets to make purchases and stock foodstuff due to fear of unknown during the exercise.\n\nAnnouncements were made in various churches in Onitsha during the services, advising worshippers to obey the sit-at-home order today to avoid any possible attack or being hit by stray bullets.\n\nAttendance in many churches was scanty due to fear, as many people assumed the sit-at-home started yesterday as it used to.\n\nChairman of Onitsha Main Market Association, Kenneth Onyeka, said the market will remain open for business.\n\nOne of the traders, Johnson Dikemba, told Daily Sun that for the past few years when Biafra Day was marked, the major markets in the Onitsha shut down to respect their fathers, grandfathers and mothers who lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nDecide what you want, Umahi tells residents\n\nEbonyi Governor, David Umahi, yesterday, seemingly recanted as he asked residents of the state to feel free to participate in the sit-at-home exercise if they so wished.\n\nThe governor had, on a statewide broadcast on Saturday evening to mark his six years in office, directed Ebonyi people to go about their normal businesses today.\n\nUmahi also said he had withdrawn his earlier threat to punish any trader who closed his shop in obedience to the order, saying it was within the rights of anyone to sit at home.\n\nHis Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, who addressed a press conference in Abakaliki, yesterday, said: \u201cEbonyi government has received several requests from some families and residents of the state, requesting they would like to remain indoors today to organise private family prayers in honour of their loved ones who were murdered during the civil war. Some of the people with this special request own shops in some of our markets across the state.\n\n\u201cWhile as a government, we remain resolute in the protection of lives and property of Ebonyians and all residents of Ebonyi State, we are aware that it is the right of anyone to remain at home or go about his/her normal businesses in this regard.\n\n\u201cFollowing the foregoing, Governor Umahi, who is highly in touch with the people has directed that those who may wish to remain at home with their shop(s) locked should neither be penalised, nor their shop(s) seized as it is their constitutional right while the rights of those who may wish to go about their normal businesses should not be infringed upon as it is equally their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nAnambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia set for sit-at-home\n\nIn Anambra, preparations for the sit-at-home appeared to have started on Saturday as there was panic buying by the residents of the state. Many residents thronged the markets to buy food stuffs that would last them till Tuesday.\n\nFood stuff markets all opened yesterday for business as those returning from churches were also seen stopping over to buy food items.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command said it was adequately prepared to ensure there would be no breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Daily Sun: \u201cWe are not deterred by the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate of protecting lives and property.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, said: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, today (yesterday) is the anniversary of the creation of Biafra. And Anambra State Government, in 2016, became the first and only administration in history to honour the memory of those who died in the fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cAmong the people who attended the solemn ceremony at Ekwueme Square was Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s first vice president. So, tomorrow (today) is not a public holiday.\u201d\n\nAsked if the civil service and schools would open today, he responded with a question: \u201cDid you hear that the government is closing down any school or declaring a public holiday or work free day? Tomorrow is just another day.\u201d\n\nAs at late yesterday evening, Imo residents appeared set to comply with the order IPOB order.\n\nRoads were getting completely deserted while most shops which normally opened on Sundays remained locked.\n\nAlso, many churches in the urban areas witnessed low turnout of worshipers while those that managed to hold services hurriedly closed.\n\nHowever, the police had assured residents of their safety, noting they had activated every tactical means to make sure no lives or property would be lost in the state today.\n\nSimilarly, a wave of uncertainty enveloped Enugu State, yesterday, ostensibly because of recent security threats.\n\nSo, many residents said they would like to stay indoors today to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n\nSome who are Federal Government workers said they would watch out first before taking any action, \u201cnow that the Federal Government facilities are targets.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, warned anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the relative peace and security enjoyed in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt would be vehemently resisted.\n\nHowever, residents of Abia State have braced up for the exercise even as police called on the people to ignore the order.\n\nMost residents of the state already see today as a public holiday as they bought most of what they would use on Monday, on Friday and Saturday.\n\nIn some churches across the state, yesterday, adherents were asked to remain at home as not to be victims of any clash between security agents and Biafra agitators.\n\nCommercial vehicle and tricycle operators spoken to said they would be off the streets in compliance with the order.\n\nAlthough, the state government did not issue order for closure of markets, some traders, who spoke to Daily Sun, said they would stay at home to avoid any trouble.\n\nDeal with troublemakers \u2013Delta CP\n\nCommissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammed Ali, yesterday, urged his officers to deal decisively with troublemakers in any part of the state.\n\nAli warned that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting Biafra flag in whatever guise in the state.\n\nHis warning is coming on the heels of the sit-at-home order for today by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAli, in a statement, yesterday, by the acting Public Relations Officer of the command, Bright Edafe, said undercover police detectives have been deployed across the state to arrest anyone caught carrying Biafra flag, and ensure they are dealt with accordance with the law of the land.",

          "text": "\u2022El Rufai: Bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives\n\n\u2022We paid N180 million, received no help from govt, say parents\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nAll the remaining abducted students of the Greenfield University, Kaduna, have been released after spending harrowing 40 days in captivity, the authorities of Greenfield University, confirmed this in a statement last night.\n\nThe registrar of the University, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, in the said statement stated that all the remaining students and non academic staff that were abducted by the bandits were released and had been reunited with their families.\n\nAlso, confirming the news, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai assured the studentsthat, \u201cthe bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nBut some of the parents of the released students have expressed disappointment in the government at all levels for allegedly leaving them to their fate, saying they had to cough out a whopping N180 million to the bandits before they released their children.\n\nHowever, part of the statement by Greenfield stated thus: \u201cAs you are aware that on Tuesday, April 20th, 2021 armed bandits attacked Greenfield University and abducted 20 students and three non academic staff. Five out of the abducted students and a Male warden were grossly murdered by the bandits.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that, today, being Saturday, May 29, 2021 that all the remaining students and non academic staff have been released by the bandits and they have already been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, University Council, Management, Staff and Students of our university, we wish to thank all Nigerians and well wishers all over the world for standing by us during this trying times\u201d.\n\nBandits had on April 18 invaded the university located along the dreaded Kaduna-Abuja road about 8:30pm and abducted 23 students. Few days after the abduction, the bandits, who had demanded N800 million as ransom, killed five of the students, when negotiations were still going on.\n\nOn April 23, the bandits killed three of the students, five days after their abduction. Their remains were found in Kwanan Bature village, close to the university. On April 26, two more students were killed and security personnel recovered their corpses in the bush.\n\nOne of the parents was said to have paid a ransom of N20 million for the release of her son.\n\nOn its part, the Kaduna State Government said in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, \u201cThe kidnapped students of the Greenfield University, who had been held hostage by armed bandits, have been released by their abductors.\n\n\u201cThis was reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies. According to the reports, about 2pm today, Saturday, the hostages were found released along the Kaduna-Abuja road. Fourteen persons were released in total, comprising students and staff.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that they were abducted by armed bandits in April and had been in captivity since then. Five students were gruesomely killed by the bandits in the period.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai welcomed the news of the students\u2019 release, and conveyed solace and encouragement to them following their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\u201cHe assured them that the bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a short video that went viral last night, two of the parents of the abducted children, a man and a woman, who were bitter about their experience so far despite the release of their children confirmed that they paid some N180 million before the release that was later celebrated by government and security agencies.\n\nThe parents, who alleged neglect by the government both confirmed that neither the state nor the federal government participated in the process that led to the release of the children, particularly, that the security agencies refused to help in whatever form of shape.\n\n\u201cN180 million, that\u2019s what we paid; that\u2019s what they collected. One hundred and eighty million, that is they collected from us \u2013 from the parents without the help of a government. None of the government officials that has come to our aid since the 20th of April that they took these children. No single one policeman that the government has released to go after them,\u201d the male parent told a reporter, shortly after the children were released.\n\nSimilarly, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammad Jalige, also confirmed the release of the 14 students, when contacted by telephone. Jalige, who said the students were released Saturday evening, added that three of them were still being held.\n\n\u201cYes, 14 of the students of the Greenfield University were released from captivity this evening (Saturday), remaining three of them still in captivity,\u201d Jalige explained. He did not give details of the students\u2019 release and why three were still being held.\n\nWhen contacted, Registrar of the university, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, said he was busy and promised to confirm later. \u201cYes, we are still on it. I am very busy right now. You can call me back later to confirm,\u201d Bashir said by telephone.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, who claimed to be the leader of the bandits that abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa Service, on May 3, threatened to kill the students if a ransom of N100 million in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles were not provided the following day.Jalingo had disclosed during the interview that the families of the abducted students paid N55 million.\n\nHowever, in a statement on May 14, the spokesman of parents of the students, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, said the parents contributed N60 million as ransom for the release of the students but failed to secure their release.\n\nAfter series of negotiations, the bandits were said to have demanded the sum of N10 million from each of the parents of the students for their release.\n\nIt could not be immediately established how much each parent paid for the release of the students and why three of them are still in captivity.\n\nThirty-nine students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna, had also be kidnapped on March 11 in a similar manner, when bandits invaded their school about 11: 30pm. The last batch of 27 of the students was released about two weeks ago after spending 56 days in captivity. Their parents were said to have paid millions of naira before they were released.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nokia X20 Review \u2013 Dualsight Camera, 2-day battery life, and more",
          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",
          "summary": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country.\nIt has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects.\nBut the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook.\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria.\nKaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.",

          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more?

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity.

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChildren are wonderful gifts to their parents and are treasured, catered for and trained, equipping them with the basic needs and characters to face the challenges of life with the hope that they become great leaders of tomorrow to pilot the affairs of the society, states, nation and the world at large.\n\nFollowing the recognition of the role played by children in each family and the need to celebrate and make them feel loved and important, preparing them for leadership positions in future, a day was set aside for them.\n\nA day was set aside to celebrate children, and that day is \u201cCHILDREN\u2019S DAY\u201d. May 27 is traditionally the children\u2019s holiday in Nigeria, a day to celebrate the children.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day began in 1857 by Reverend Dr Charles Leonard in Chelsea, US. Even though Children\u2019s Day is celebrated globally by most of the countries in the world on June 1st, Universal Children\u2019s Day takes place annually on November 20th.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honor of children, whose date of observance varies by countries as the international Children\u2019s Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare in 1952. While United Nations first established the day in 1964, the day remains important in the lives of many Nigerian kids.\n\nIt is a national day to celebrate the importance of children and the day provides policymakers and families with an opportunity to consider the personal development of young Nigerians.\n\nIt is a public holiday for Primary and Secondary school children. Due to the large size of the country, only a few groups of children (schools or other organizations) are selected to participate in march past parade as organised by various states across the federation. The ravaging COVID 19 pandemic has even slowed down the celebration as large crowd is prohibited to check the spread.\n\nOn May 27th every year, children are granted a holiday while several social activities are centred on them. Excused from school, most kids converge at stadiums and centres to commemorate the event. COVID 19 however has changed the way its been celebrated across the globe.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s led administration places great premium on the lives of Edo children, preparing them for leadership positions in the state, country and world at large. Flowing from this, the governor introduced Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme to lay a good foundation for them.\n\nEDOBEST, is a programme organised to catch the kids young at the basic level educationally with the use of technology in learning. This programme is chaired by a committed, dedicated, selfless, and hardworking Edo woman and the Chairman Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe. Under her dynamic leadership, Edo children have benefited greatly from EDOBEST. They can now read, write, do arithmetic correctly. Most striking is that even primary one pupils in public schools across Edo State are now able to read books meant for their age category.\n\nTo ensure that learning does not just end in the classroom, SUBEB decided to key into 2021 celebration to show and express how important Edo children are to the Obaseki\u2019s administration.\n\nThe children\u2019s day celebration was held across the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State with various activities to spice up the day for the children and make it memorable. Children in Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North were all captured in the celebration galore, thanks to the foresight of Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe.\n\nThe 2021 Children\u2019s Day celebration with the theme: \u201cUnite to reverse the impacts of COVID 19 Pandemic on children,\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari celebrated the Day with a solemn promise to bequeath a better country for the present and future generations. He described children as precious blessings that should be nurtured to carry the burden of the society in the future.\n\nIn a message to celebrate Edo children, Governor Godwin Obaseki assured that his administration will sustain ongoing reforms to strengthen public institutions to guarantee a sustainable future for Edo children. He added that his administration will continue to implement policy reforms to benefit children in the state. \u201cI am delighted to mark this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day and celebrate our children, who are the future of Edo State and Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said Edo children were beneficiaries of very pragmatic reforms that the administration have undertaken in the education sector over the past four years.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed fulfilling that we can see the evidence of the huge investment made in transforming the way our children learn, which is manifest in the outcomes from our basic education sector.\u201d\n\nEdo pupils across the 18 Local Government Area were very much involved in this year\u2019s celebration as SUBEB and Edo State Government engaged them in various activities despite restrictions necessitated by coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUnlike previous celebration held in Benin, the Executive Chairman of SUBEB Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe said the celebration was discentralised in 2019 to ensure children participate across the three senatorial districts. She explained that the COVID 19 pandemic led to SUBEB taking it a step further by organising \u201cmicro children\u2019s day\u201d celebration across the 18 LGA. She noted that a major highlight for the 2021 celebration was launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d literacy campaign.\n\n\u201cAs part of the 2021 celebration, we have launched \u2018Every Child a Reading Champion Literacy campaign\u2019. The aim is for our children leaving primary school to know how to read. When leaving primary six our pupils will be able to read fluently and also can author a book. That is the standard we are setting for ourselves. We are also rolling out classroom library where each child take turn to become the class liberian.\n\n\u201cSince 2018 when EDOBEST was launched, over seven million textbooks and instructional materials have been distributed to schools across the State. For the 2021 celebration, we have distributed over 40,000 books and instructional materials.\n\nFrom Ehor in Uhunmwode, Abudu in Orihiomwon, Idogbo in Ikpoba-Okha to Uselu in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, it was all celebration and fun for the children. Moving to Etsako West in Edo North, Ubiaja in Esan South East, the stories were not different, it was a day to celebrate Edo children.\n\nIn Ehor, Abudu and Idogbo children engaged in match past, poem recitations, football game, cultural display by participating schools. Even pupils from far Central and North did not need to come to Benin City to be part of it the excitement. Edo pupils were celebrated in Ekpoma, Ubiaja, Auchi and other designated locations for the event across the 18 LGA.\n\nIn Ehor, the focus was on parents. They were urged to inculcate fear of God into their children as they mark the day in Uhunmwode Local Government Area. A teacher, Mr Ohenhen Johnson, of Uwa Model Primary school in Uhunmwode local government area, said that it was necessary for all parents and guardians to inculcate fear of God into their children and wards.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe children are the future leaders, so parents must not fail in this direction, our responsibilities goes beyond just housing, feeding and providing shelter for them\u201d.\n\nAnother teacher, Mrs. Francisca Eze of Victory Primary School in Ehor, called on government at all levels to keep investing in the educational sector, adding that education is key to the development and success of the country.\n\nEze said that parents also should keep assisting their children while at home and ensure they bring them up in God\u2019s way.\n\nIn Abudu the administrative headquarters of Orihiomwon Local Government Area of Edo State, the Head of Local Government Administration (HOLGA) and acting Chairman of the council, Dr. Francis Odigie was on ground to celebrate with the children as he mounted the podium to recieve salute from the over 10 schools that participated in a match past at the council secretariat, venue for the event.\n\nHe said children should be celebrated as the leaders of tommorow. He lauded the Governor Godwin Obaseki led administration for creating the platform for children of the state to have access to basic education through the establishment of EDOBEST which has introduced technology to learning.\n\nThe Education Secretary of the council Aghedo Gideon expressed joy for this celebration saying the children has never had it so good. He emphasized that the collaboration between SUBEB and Edo State Government has improved the education system in Edo State.\n\nIn Auchi Edo North, SUBEB focused its celebration on achieving global standard literacy, numeracy skills in the state. It challenged leaders and parents to equip children to enable them compete globally and emerge employable in the digital age and age to come.\n\n\u201cAll the children of Edo represent our future, and we owe it to ourselves and our children to invest wisely and build the right institutions, system and processes\u201d.\n\nMrs. Joy Ojobor who represented the SUBEB Chairman said launching a campaign to make every child in the state a \u201cReading Champion\u201d is to encourage the culture of reading among children of the state.\n\n\u201cThe ability to read is the key that unlocks vast knowledge and capacity that is responsible for shaping a secured future\u201d.\n\nAt Ubiaja and other locations across other four local government area of Esan Central senatorial District, the celebration continued with match past, cultural displays and other activities. EDSG in collaboration with SUBEB also restated its commitment to increase school enrollment in both primary and secondary schools in the State.\n\nParents were urged not to discourage children from attending classes as the governor remained committed in its efforts to direct resources towards the education and welfare of all Edo children. The parents were told that Edo state continues to lead with the lowest number of \u201cout of school children\u201d in the the country.\n\nAcross the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State, on a day meant for them, children expressed their happiness and readiness to step in to leadership positions to pilot the affairs of the State. Some pupils of Uwa Model Primary School, Ikhuenerio including Victory Egberanmwen and Perpetual Osaretin could not hide their joy.\n\nAccording to Victory, \u201cI feel so happy to be here to compete and have fun with other pupils. I thank the governor for EDOBEST which has made my school look so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will like to thank Governor Obaseki for the gift of books, I feel so excited to be part of this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day celebration,\u201d Perpetual said.\n\nThis is the first children\u2019s day since the outbreak of Coronavirus and looking at it now, it shows that we are overcoming the COVID, as education stakeholders were all happy that Children\u2019s Day celebration held in 2021.\n\nThe stakeholders also expressed hope that with the launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d during the 2021 children\u2019s day in Edo State, the dividends will soon be realized in pupils as they would become not only fluent readers but champions in all aspects of academic disciplines.\n\n...",

Between Oju Ore in Ota to Winners Chapel, all in Ogun State, there are almost eight of these petrol stations, why? Urgent measure must be put in place to sanitise the industry. Others are located in Alfa Nla Agege, Estate, Ipaja, Ipaja Road, Agege, Dopemu Road, Iyana Orile, all in Lagos.

          "text": "As the federal government intensifies engagements with Nigerians on its readiness to fully deregulate the downstream arm of the petroleum industry, controversy is rife over the sudden increase in the number of petrol stations owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), popularly called NNPC Mega Stations, across the country.\n\nSome industry watchers are concerned about the growing number of these petrol dispensing stations, and are insinuating that some persons with links to the oil and gas regulatory agencies, some of whom are retired NNPC officials, may have set up parallel retail outlets thereby taking positions in petrol retail business to cash in on the anticipated deregulated petrol industry.\n\nAccording to a source, these individuals may be masterminds of the NNPC retail outlets that are scattered in some parts of Lagos and Ogun states.\n\n\u201cWe have one before Shagamu interchange. Between Oju Ore in Ota to Winners Chapel, all in Ogun State, there are almost eight of these petrol stations, why? Urgent measure must be put in place to sanitise the industry.

Research shows that four out of five new businesses fail, we exist to reverse this ugly trend and help businesses thrive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy if you create products and services that customers need and price them correctly and consistent sales are guaranteed,\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nSimilarly, Emmanuel uses data driven sales approach to coach his numerous clients across various industries. He recounts how his client\u2019s decision to make what customers want helped them transition into the power bank industry at a time when no one saw the opportunity. It was a no brainer; customers were willing to pay to power their phones so it was easy to tell they will pay to own a device that can power their phone for hours even when there is a blackout.\n\nHe noted that by simply leveraging on data, he changed the fortune of his clients\u2019 businesses and put them miles ahead of their competitors.\n\nAlso, Smart Emmanuel\u2019s success in the oil and gas industry can also be linked with his \u201cmake what customers want\u201d philosophy ventured into downstream oil and gas in 2013; He said, \u201cI was coming into a red ocean, a very competitive market. I rose to become my client\u2019s number one vendor by focusing on the things they really wanted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey wanted good quality, fair prices and a realistic timeline for payment. I also made sure my partners got a fair deal. For us, it was about becoming number one. We knew that the frequency of transaction was more important than the profit per transaction,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further said he was focused on taking his message to make what customers want across borders as it is relevant in Africa and across the world. The biggest brands know this secret and they use it to make product development decisions.",

He is about to be awakened to the rage of the Niger Delta region\u201d, he said.\n\nRead Tompolo\u2019s full statement:\n\nPRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI AND SENATOR GODSWILL AKPABIO SHOULD AS A MATTER OF URGENCY CONSTITUTE THE SUBSTANTIVE BOARD OF THE NIGER DELTA DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION (NDDC)\n\nI have watched and observed with keen interest, the circumstances surrounding the constitution of the NDDC board for some time now. I would have continued to keep watching and observing, but for love of the region and the country.\n\nThe continuous running of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) by a sole administrator at the instance of the minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Akpabio, is undemocratic and anti-development, hence unacceptable to the people of the region. The people of the region are averse to a one man show in a commission that is supposed to attend to the developmental needs of nine states, namely, Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers. It will likely set the region on fire, sooner than later.\n\nThe act establishing the commission provided among other things that it will be administered by a board comprising of a Chairman, Managing Director, Executive Directors and Commissioners who will be drawn from the nine states that made up the region. However, this provision has been blatantly undermined by Senator Godswill Akpabio and his co-travellers in the Presidency. There is no provision for either interim management committee or sole administration in the act that establishes the NDDC. Common sense will tell you that the so called forensic audit that has been used by Senator Akpabio to strangle the commission could be best conducted with a substantive board that brings all representatives from the nine states and other parts of the country. As one from the region, Senator Akpabios initial mission to audit past activities of the commission was seen as welcome development, but later the people realised that it was a personal mission to feather the next of his 2023 political ambition. Clearly, the present state of the commission is abnormal and could throw the relatively peaceful region in the country into chaos and acrimony.\n\nUndermining the very clear provisions in the establishing act under the guise of an endless forensic audit is evil, and should be condemned by all well-meaning Nigerians. It is in itself an act of corruption as the people of the region have lost so much resources in the process of the so called forensic audit. No one can tell the amount of money that has been spent by Senator Akpabio in pursuing this divisive agenda. It is obvious that there will be another forensic audit to investigate the activities of Senator Akpabio by the time he let grip off the commission. This is disheartening and worrisome.\n\nSenator Akpabio has refused to pay contractors even after evaluation of work done. He has selectively paid his cronies and those in the list of political patronage. It is an open secret that some contractors have been made to part with up to between 30% and 50% of the contract sum. I ask, where is the equity and probity of this sole administration?\n\nThere is no way things will continue in this manner. I am surprised at the recent silence of highly placed persons from the region on this matter. Perhaps, Senator Akpabio is not alone on this NDDC abduction. This must be a product of high wired conspiracy among persons from the Presidency, National Assembly and Security Agencies to perpetually silence all well-meaning Nigerians in this strange deal. Senator Akpabio should know that it is time to end this barbaric act as it will be concertedly resisted in the days ahead.\n\nSenator Akpabios temporal reprieve from the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) protest is a childs play compare to what is to come in a few days. He is about to be awakened to the rage of the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt is against this background that I wish to call on Mr President, members of the National Assembly and Security Agencies to work towards the constitution of the substantive board of the NDDC within a few days to avert a total breakdown of law and order that will equally affect crude oil exploration and exploitation activities in the region. I hereby proclaim a seven days ultimatum starting the date of this publication to inaugurate the substantive board of the commission.\n\nSigned:\n\nHigh Chief Government Ekpemupolo (Tompolo)\n\nThe Ibe-Ebidouwei of Ijaw Nation",

But the plan failed.\n\nBMO warned the former president and his co-travellers to quickly perish the thought and save the country from avoidable constitutional crisis and civil unrest.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, the pro-Buhari group lampooned the conspirators for their recourse to unconstitutional means to force the resignation of President Buhari, describing the move as reckless and anti-Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur highly reliable security sources have informed us of the determination of the former President to go ahead with a plan to cause disaffection in the country through a planned conference of so-called eminent Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile the Conference ostensibly aims to review the state of the nation, we can authoritatively confirm that it is actually a premeditated plan to create confusion in the polity by calling President Buhari to resign after a supposed vote of no confidence.\n\n\u201cOur Security sources said the worries over this latest move by the former leader is not so much about the illegality of the planned declaration but the anarchical mindset behind it, especially given the growing resurgence of military putsch in the West African sub-region. Any appearance of national confusion, even if scripted without any basis, could fuel unreasoned confusion.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on Nigerians to be wary of manoeuvres by people who are desperate to erode the foundation of our hard-fought democracy to further the agenda of a desperate, bumptious and self-serving group of elites besotted with power to the point that they are ready to throw the country into a contrived pandemonium to remain relevant\u201d.",

Musa Ishaq Dala (Sarkin Hausawan Nyanya-Abuja).\n\nThe community leader, who was responding to questions on the ongoing public debate on the operations of the NYSC Scheme, described the idea behind the establishment of the NYSC as noble, stressing that the rural posting of the Scheme is an effective tool that fosters national unity, integration and grassroots development.\n\nAlh. Dala, who praised the gallantry and sacrifice of our heroes past, further cautioned that there is no alternative capable of replacing the NYSC Scheme. He called on all patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians to join forces together towards ensuring that the Scheme is reformed and supported to effectively address contemporary developmental challenges.\n\nDala disclosed that contrary to the insinuations that insecurity undermines the objectives of the Scheme, lawmakers should concentrate in implementing the provisions of the national defence policy which makes the NYSC members a reserve force.\n\nHe stressed that we do not have any other country besides Nigeria, charging everyone to uphold it.\n\nHe also advised NYSC Management to further consolidate on its ICT infrastructure by ensuring that certificates issued by the Scheme, deployment and posting policies are made available online as a transparent and effective solution to allegations of lobbying for relocation to states and geo-political zones of origin.\n\nAlh. Dala also advised the Scheme to sustain a proactive awareness campaign, targeted at traditional institutions on the need to be hospitable to Corps Members in their various domains, knowing fully well that there own children would be accorded same treatment in other parts of the country.\n\nThe Sarkin Hausawan also reminded Nigerians that nobody outside Nigeria will be responsible for addressing our national challenges, other than Nigerians.\n\nHe expressed concern on the category of Nigerian graduates exempted for participation in the Scheme on the grounds of age, stressing that the scheme should devise a local deployment policy within states or geopolitical zones, in order to give all graduates the opportunity to contribute to national development.",

They particularly condemned all actions that led to ongoing instability in Mali, and its attendant consequences in the region.\n\nThey decided to suspend Mali from ECOWAS institutions in line with ECOWAS provisions; and called for a new civilian Prime Minister to be nominated immediately.\n\nThey also demanded that a new inclusive government should be formed to proceed with the transition programme; while reaffirming the need to respect the transition period of 18 months decided in Accra.",

The communique read in parts \u201ccalls on the Federal Government to declare a national emergency on security and urgently come up with proactive strategies to restore peace and security to all parts of the country; \u201cEmphasizes that, if the security situation is not dealt with and banditry stopped or reduced to the barest minimum, it would not be feasible to have proper elections in 2023; \u201cUnequivocally and in full resolve, calls on the APC and PDP and other political parties to zone the Presidency, in 2023 to the South; at the next election. \u201cEnjoins political stakeholders from the South not to be lured into the unpatriotic step of seeking such other positions as National Chairmen and Vice President of the main political parties, but join forces to demand and ensure that the Presidency moves to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe leaders also criticized President Buhari\u2019s stance on resolutions of the Governors of Southern States as it pertains to ban on open grazing and restructuring.\n\nThey insisted \u201cthat cattle rearing is a generally, private business enterprise, as such, the Federal Government should avoid committing state resources to promote any particular business, beyond providing the enabling environment, in the performance of its regulatory roles\u201d.\n\nIn attendance were Elder statesman, Edwin Clark, who chaired the meeting, Ayo Adebanjo who leads the Southwest group Afenifere; George Obiozor \u2013 President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide for the Southeast, Pogu Bitrus \u2013 National President, Middle Belt Forum and\n\nSenator Emmanuel Essien, National Chairman PANDEF for the South-south region.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
