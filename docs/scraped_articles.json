          "text": "SUSPECTED Fulani herders invaded some communities in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State and killed nine persons in separate attacks.\n\nThe attacks were said to have taken place on Friday, Sunday and Monday, leading to the death of nine persons.\n\nIt was reliably gathered that four persons were murdered and seven others injured while returning from church on Sunday on the outskirts of Gbanjimba, headquarters of Guma LGA.\n\nThe marauding herders were reported to have also launched another attack on Monday where four other persons were killed.\n\nA source who simply identified himself as Tersoo said, \u201cThe herders\u2019 incidence in Guma local government area is becoming alarming.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Japhet Davidson\n\nAs Federal government battles with the search for ways to transform the country to an industrialised economy, a business magnate and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Caesar Engineering and Construction Limited Dr. Caesar Osaheni Iyayi has come up with fast ways on how actualise that in his new book titled \u2018The ABC of How to Industrialise Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThe high profile public presentation of the 390 paged book, which will be graced by eminent personalities and captains of industry is scheduled for the first quarter of 2022 in Abuja.\n\nDr. Iyayi who is passionate for the emancipation of Nigeria, Africa and the Black Race through industrialisation is the eldest son of the renowned Entrepreneur, Industrialist, Business Mogul Dr. Iyayi Efianayi, MFR of blessed memory..\n\nDr. Iyayi who believes that, an industrialised Nigeria, manufacturing her goods in Nigeria by Nigerians, should be the concern of all, for the survival of the Black Race is convinced that industrialisation is the only way to create wealth, employment and development.\n\nThe painstakingly researched, solution focused and innovative book is a treasure trove as a single document to understand the country\u2019s crucial development profile and fundamentals.\n\nCovering almost all the aspects of what Nigeria\u2019s priorities should be, the book is uniquely rich and deserves a wide-readership and long shelf-life.\n\n\u2018The ABC of How to Industrialise Nigeria\u2019 is also important as a development history of the country. It brings to the fore, a step by step method on how the Federal and State Governments can mobilise the Nigerian indigenous private sector to industrialise the country.\n\nAccording to the Author, \u201cWe must take urgent steps to transform Nigeria from an agrarian society to a manufacturing economy. There is no alternative. It is bend or break. If we fail to industrialise, we will never be able to defend ourselves and shall therefore be at the mercy of foreign powers that dealt ruthlessly with our forefathers. If we fail to industrialise, then we are doomed to suffer another wave of slavery or extinction on African soil\u201d\n\nWhile emphasising the pivotal role that Nigerians must play in transforming the country to an industrialised economy, the author powerfully stated in the book that \u2018there is no country in the world that was industrialised by foreigners\u2019.\n\nIn the words of Chief Gabriel Igbinedion, the Esama of Benin Kingdom who wrote the foreword, \u201cIf we ever needed a manual to drive effective change in Nigeria today, Dr Caesar Osaheni Iyayi has just delivered one into our very hands.\n\nFrom his detailed assessment of our problems as a country, down to his proffered solutions; it does not take a genius to understand that the power to drive industrial change lies within the shores of our beautiful country. This is a must read for everyone\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Nnamdi Ojiego\n\nFormer Ogun State governor, Mr Gbenga Daniel, has reiterated his support for restructuring, even as he stressed that sudden fiscal restructuring would cause chaos in the country.\n\nDaniel spoke on the Theme, \u201cUnderstanding Democracy, Quality Representation and Political Management\u201c, at the Continuous Political Education Programme of Political Leadership Training Institute, POLA, held from Friday September 17 to Sunday September, 19, 2021.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain and Chancellor of POLA, stated that the path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth lied on the universe of values, and on the nation\u2019s ability to develop a clear 10-year roadmap for local productions of all that its citizens must consume.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs an advocate for restructuring, I believe in compartmental growth, one which will relax the pressure on the centre and advance the economic strength of the federating units. But this approach must be systemic and not brash.\n\n\u201cA sudden fiscal restructuring that doesn\u2019t focus on collective economic growth for all states will create a chaotic migration problem and burden for the developed ones. Hence, the approach for a heterogeneous country like ours will be to create a blueprint that will assist all federating units to reach sustainable economy that thrives on local economic growth relying on the peculiar economic niche.\n\n\u201cI repeat, the path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth lies on the universe of values; on the nation\u2019s ability to develop a clear 10-year roadmap for local productions of all that its citizens must consume. This will answer not only to its economic recovery, but more importantly towards addressing what is now becoming its perennial security challenges.\n\n\u201cTherefore, restructuring plan can best work when the federating states have the potential for self-sufficiency. This underscores the need for a ten years blueprint for economic revolution across the country; the mono-economic dependency system is unsustainable, and archaic. Let\u2019s call it \u2018A path to restructuring\u2019, but it must be one with the plan that no state is left behind.\n\n\u201cFor instance, every political party including the All Progressive Congress have Restructuring in their Campaign and Policy documents (albeit in various forms and perspectives), what is therefore left is for creative leaders to channel the national thinking towards unity of purpose and common goals. Nigeria needs leaders who can manage our diversities for optimum advantage using the Principles of Comparative Costs and Advantage to develop every part of the country simultaneously\u201d, the Daniel opined.\n\nContinuing, the POLA Chancellor charged Nigerians to get involved in the electoral process and avoid \u2018siddon-look\u2019 attitude. \u201cFor citizens to enjoy good governance, they must ensure that only the best hands were handed over the mantle of leadership. When we fail to give public offices to individuals with the right quality and capacity, we end up with a GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out).\n\n\u201cBut it is not also enough to give power, citizens play a crucial role in society. They are the ombudsman who checkmate the process and ensure that elected representatives perform optimally. For a society to be better, the citizens must avoid the siddon-look approach and participate in the process. They must critique, guide, educate, inform and most especially render assistance when required for collective prosperity.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Ozioruva Aliu\n\n\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 AN Edo State based Chinese firm, Yongxing Steel Company has called for investment in Nigeria\u2019s growing economy which it said it is needed for Nigeria to achieve its potentials of becoming a global force among the comity of nations.\n\nThis call is on the heels of sharp division among the workers on whether there is a need for them to have an organized workers union in the over ten years old company.\n\nREAD ALSOEdo University Uzairue holds 3rd convocation\n\n\n\nManaging Director of the company, Frank Wang at a stakeholders\u2019 interactive session yesterday said his firm has created 700 direct employment as well as 10,000 indirect jobs.\n\nRepresented by the spokesman Ben Den and his address read by the Assistant Public Relations Officer of the company, Olufemi Isaac the steel company boss expressed the firm\u2019s willingness to support the country adding that Nigeria\u2019s current challenges was not enough to discourage investors from maximizing the advantages of investing in Nigeria with its huge population.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to use this opportunity to encourage other foreign investors not to run away from Nigeria. There is no economy that does not have difficulties. Our duty is to support the nation in her efforts to surmount those difficulties.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the construction sector, we need to be more patient with Nigeria. Nigeria is a growing economy and will continue to grow.\n\n\u201cWith the huge infrastructural gap in the country, the construction sector will continue to grow and any foreign investor in that sector is not likely to regret it in the end,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Managing Director stated that the firm\u2019s waste to wealth programme has created hundreds of employment opportunities while also ensuring a cleaner environment.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs many of you are aware, the basic raw materials for our production come from things which are otherwise a problem in the environment. \u201cWe empower people to gather these waste materials that litter the whole environment, we pay for them, we use technology to recycle them and produce some of the best steel products that are used in the construction industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat way, we are not only creating employment, we are cleaning the environment, and we are contributing immensely to the construction sector which is very vital to a growing economy like Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe placed a premium on the welfare of our workers just as we have in our own little ways contributed to the development of our host community through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).\n\n\n\n\u201cAs for the staff, we have ensured regular training within and outside the country, provision of shelter, health insurance programme and provision of a safe environment to work.\n\n\n\nThe Enogie (duke) of Ogua, Chief Ogie Aghaghowen, commended the steel company for creating an economically friendly environment and also for ensuring peace in Ogua community.\n\n\n\nHowever while the briefing was going on with support from some members of both the junior and senior staff who said they were comfortable with the working conditions and environment presented by the company and were therefore opposed to having a union, some of the workers carried placards protesting alleged inhuman working conditions for them by the company.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the controversy of having a union in the company, National Secretary of the Steel and Engineering Workers Union of Nigeria (SEWUN),an affiliate of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) Comrade Kassim Kadiri alleged that the company had reneged on its agreement to allow union in the company.\n\n\n\nHe said \u201cWe got to know about the company in 2013, and we have tried to unionize the place, but what they did was to organize some workers inside the company, who said that they don\u2019t want a union. We wanted to meet the management, but they kept turning us around until 2014 when we declared a Trade Dispute against the management.\u201d\n\n\n\nKadiri alleged that the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which was signed in 2015 for the company to allow for a union was broken when the company immediately transferred the elected chairman to its warehouse in Kano state he said the state government has set up another committee to look into the matter once more.",

          "title": "WaterAid raises alarm over threat by climate change to water supplies in Africa",
          "text": "By Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nFollowing challenges in access to water supply, WaterAid Nigeria, Tuesday, raised alarm over threat posed by dreaded climate change to water supplies in Africa.\n\nThis was made known by WaterAid in a statement, where it announced Africa Climate Week, to be hosted virtually by Uganda and United Nations, UN, partners, from Sunday 26-29 September, as African countries prepare their positions in advance of the COP26 climate summit in the UK.\n\nAccording to WaterAid, Africa is the most-exposed region to the adverse effects of climate change despite contributing the least to global warming. The entire continent accounts for less than four per cent of total global carbon emissions but is home to 33 of the top 50 countries most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cThis year\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows a clear link between climate change and water. It makes a stark warning that urgent action is needed to tackle the dangerous effects of climate change, which is most felt through access to water: flooding, drought, unpredictable weather patterns and salination from rising seas.\n\n\u201cCurrent examples include by 2025 Niger\u2019s annual water needs will exceed the available water resources and by 2050 water volumes are expected to fall significantly across Burkina Faso; The UN declared that Madagascar is on the brink of experiencing the world\u2019s first \u201cclimate change famine\u201d in the south of the island nation.\n\n\u201cThe fluctuations in the levels of Malawi\u2019s 2nd largest body of water, Lake Chilwa, have become ever more extreme affecting the lives of 1.5 million who live in that densely populated basin region. Pictured above and available here.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 60 million people lack clean water close to home, depending almost entirely on groundwater for domestic water supply, especially in rural areas.Groundwater provides much-needed protection against the impacts of climate change, acting as a buffer to changing water availability and quality in many parts of the world.\n\n\u201cClimate change is also aggravating the sanitation crisis. Extreme weather \u2013 floods, rising temperatures, prolonged droughts \u2013 are causing irreparable damage to weak sanitation systems and causing illnesses to spread further in vulnerable communities. An estimated 250,000 additional deaths per year are predicted between 2030 and 2050 due to climate change and many of these deaths will be linked to poor sanitation.\u201d\n\nThe statement also pointed that poor sanitation and the transmission of fatal, but preventable illnesses \u2013 such as cholera \u2013 are also compounded by the effects of climate change. Only 88 million people living in Nigeria (that is 44% of the population) can rely on safely managed sanitation \u2013 that is a toilet serviced to allowed human waste to be treated and disposed of safely.\n\n\u201cAbout 32 million people (16% of the population) have limited sanitation \u2013 that is the use of improved latrines where there is hygienic separation of human faeces from human contact but that is shared by two or more households. A staggering 112 million people still do not have access to a private toilet of their own, and about 46 million have no choice but to practise open defecation.\n\n\u201cWhere decent toilets are lacking, human faeces can contaminate the groundwater or end up in rivers and lakes, polluting what is often the only supply of water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. Children play on ground rife with pathogens and as a result of faecal contamination, whole communities can contract diarrhoeal diseases.\n\n\u201cNigeria ranks 55th most vulnerable country to climate change \u2013 among the top 35% in the world \u2013 but only receives USD $1 per person, per year in climate finance. This is for both mitigation \u2013 cutting carbon emissions \u2013 and adaptation \u2013 reducing the impacts of climate change. While developing countries contribute very little to global carbon emissions, they are the least prepared to withstand the effects, with little money allocated towards helping them. The average person in Nigeria accounts annually for emissions of 0.546 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 compared to the average per capita emission in the United States of 16.5 metric tonnes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Country Director, WaterAid Nigeria, Evelyn Mere, Country said: \u201cClimate change has intensified both the sanitation and water crisis. The climate clock is ticking and if efforts are not made to better understand, value and protect this vital resource, making it a central feature of climate change adaptation strategies, then we face a very bleak future.\n\n\u201cThe government must respond now to the urgent threat of climate change and recognise the vital role climate-resilient water and sanitation services and systems play in helping vulnerable communities be more prepared for climate change; because despite contributing the least to it, it is the world\u2019s poorest people currently suffering the brunt of its destructive impact.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cAchieving these national climate plans requires significant financing to use to adapt to climate change. At present, only five per cent of total global climate funding is spent on helping countries adapt to the changing climate, and that money is not targeted at the communities most vulnerable to climate change. Indeed, some of the most climate vulnerable countries only receive $1 per person annually for investment in water resources and services.\n\nHowever, WaterAid\u2019s Regional Director for East Africa, Olutayo Bankole-Bolawole said, \u201cWe need urgent action to make sure that the most vulnerable in Africa can cope in the face of climate change.\n\n\u201cGiven the undeniable links between climate change and water, this means that everyone must have a reliable and sustainable source of clean water and access to a toilet that is clean, safe and climate-resilient.\n\n\u201cThis level of funding is a completely inadequate response to the growing crisis and to the critical need to begin adaptation initiatives now to build resilience for the future.\n\n\u201cAfrica Climate Week is a major opportunity to highlight to national governments, regional donors and institutions the value that climate-resilient WASH brings to climate change adaptation for national action, and to advocate for the funding needed to make climate adaptation sustainable and resilient.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for all governments to urgently address the effects of the climate crisis and ensure sustainable access to clean water is a fundamental part of their national strategies for both adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhen, on August 26, Usman Muktar gave his opinion on the level of cybercrime among young Nigerians, the percentage sounded incredulous.\n\nMuktar reasoned that as much as 70 per cent of Nigerian youths are at risk of becoming ex-convicts if their current high rate of involvement in cybercrime was not checked.\n\nThe zonal commander of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Ilorin, Kwara State, should know, yet his claim seemed too mindboggling to be true, because it interprets as seven out of every 10 young Nigerians!\n\nIt is easy to assume that Muktar had merely deployed hyperbole to drive home his point on the severity of the country\u2019s legendary cyberfraud problem. Whether that is the case or not, other statistics published periodically by the anti-graft agency have had many Nigerians worried about the menace.\n\nThe EFCC on September 3, 2021 released data from a recent investigation by the Advance Fee Fraud and Cyber Crime Sections of its Lagos Command showing that between April and June 2021, 402 internet-related fraud arrests were made in the zone alone.\n\nThe data was tabulated from mostly EFCC sting operations.\n\nMillennials, students and dropouts\n\nThe agency categorised the majority of those involved as millennials, students and dropouts.\n\n\u201cThe suspects are mostly millennials, with 82 of them aged between 25 and 34 years, which speaks to the fact that most of the individuals arrested are either still in school, recent graduates or university dropouts,\u201d EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, said in a statement.\n\nDating/Romance Scam youth fraudsters\u2019 favourite\n\nAnalysis of the data further showed that most cybercriminals prefer Dating Scam/Online Dating Scam/Romance Scam. Sixty four per cent of those arrested were involved in romance scam, followed closely by \u201cMiddle Man Scam\u201d and \u201cPicking\u201d which account for eight per cent and seven per cent.\n\n\u201cThe 64 per cent involved in the dating scam benefitted to the tune of N8,310,000; $349,290 USD; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513 .\n\nOther typologies of fraud identified include forgery, possession of fraudulent documents, spamming, credit card fraud, impersonation, rental scam, loan fraud, Business Email compromise, hacking, stealing, cheque scam, phishing, and money laundering,\u201d part of the statement read.\n\nGift cards, at 39 per cent, was the prevalent method employed by the suspects to access their illicit funds.\n\n\u201cIt is followed by bank transfers at 27 per cent and Cryptocurrency at 21 per cent. A total of $12, 512.49 USD was recovered from the e-wallet accounts of four suspects within the period,\u201d the agency said.\n\nLekki, the fast-developing upper-middle-class area of Lagos State, was also identified as the new hub of internet-related fraud in Lagos.\n\nThe story is the same around the country, but with fewer arrest and conviction rates.\n\nOn September 20, the commission revealed that, a day earlier, it arrested 30 suspected \u2018Yahoo-Yahoo Boys\u2019 during a sting operation at Kwara State University (KWASU).\n\n\u201cBased on intelligence, and weeks of surveillance, operatives of the commission on September 19, 2021 executed a search warrant in hostels within the KWASU campus, where a number of arrests were made.\n\n\u201cIn the course of interrogation, those found not culpable were released to the Students Union Government (SUG) of the School, while the targets of the sting operation were brought to the Ilorin Zonal Command for further questioning,\u201d Uwujaren said.\n\nLast Thursday morning, the agency carried out sting operations at several locations in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, and arrested 21 suspects.\n\nCars, phones, laptops, watches, and subscriber identity module (SIM) cards, among other items reckoned to be properties acquired with proceeds of internet fraud, were said to have been seized.\n\nThey were arrested without any incident, the commission said.\n\nHow not to \u2018sting\u2019\n\nThe stats suggest that the EFCC under its new Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa is tacking the menace of cybercrime with renewed vigour, or perhaps with too much vigour.\n\nIn recent months, Nigerians have been alarmed by tales of frightening tactics by EFCC operatives in the course of sting operations against \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019.\n\nJournalist\u2019s home \u2018wrongly\u2019 broken into, brothers assaulted\n\nThe latest incident was narrated by a journalist, Mrs Norah Okafor, who alleged that her home in Umuahia was invaded by over 25 masked EFCC operatives last Thursday between 1:36am and 2am.\n\nOkafor, in a post on her Facebook page, said: \u201cAt exactly 1:36 a.m, I was alerted by my brother that there were armed robbers at my gate trying to make their way into the compound. Because it was an electric fence, I didn\u2019t bother enough because I felt they could not make their way in. Alas, I was wrong. At 2am prompt, they entered the compound, and they came prepared. There were over 25 of them in two Hilux buses. They were masked and dressed in all-black attire. A huge member of the team climbed the fence with a pair of pliers and immediately cut off parts of the wires. They jumped into the compound and, with an axe, broke the gate key open to enable the team enter my apartment.\n\n\u201cAs a nude sleeper, while they tried to make their way into the compound, I found something to wear while my brothers and I were thinking of a way of escape. The worst case scenario for me was that they would rape or take the only valuable available (a car key). So, I prepared my mind. The next thing I realised was that about seven of them were in my room with shouts of \u2018Lie down, face down; (switch) on the light. Where\u2019s your phone? Where\u2019s your car key?\u2019 They asked for so many things and I became confused. Seeing over 25 hefty men with different kinds of guns, mhen, e don be, be that (It had finally happened, I presumed).\n\n\u201cI handed the phone over to them with the key. Before then, they had taken my laptop. I turned to be sure they were armed robbers. They asked for my passwords to all the devices collected with masking tape to identify each. Still in shock, I heard someone destroying everything in the kitchen, my room, that of my brothers and all the drawers. I was still asking myself: what\u2019s happening?\n\n\u201cThey asked me to stand and follow them downstairs. Lo and beyond, they unmasked themselves. Hmmmm! Are these criminals? I asked. All my neighbours were already going through the same pain as I was. They had given my brothers the beating of their lives, carried my neighbour downstairs and tried unlocking all the cars in the compound. And after searching all the phones and laptops, three of them walked in. Behold, they were from EFCC.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I screamed.\n\n\u201cShut up\u201d was the next thing I heard.\n\n\u201cWhen they couldn\u2019t open my phone, they asked me to, and I did. After a while, I asked them: \u2018Please, where is your office so I can come and pick up my things on my way to work?\u2019 They asked me what I do and I said I\u2019m a journalist. They asked my neighbour and he said \u2018lawyer\u2019; the other one a \u2018doctor\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey looked at me, handed over the phones and said: \u2018We just wasted our time.\u2019\n\n\u201cThose fools spent over one hour molesting and destroying things in this compound. I feel so pained and embarrassed right now. \u201cIs this how EFCC operates? How did we get here? Who is the informant? I am just confused right now. Thank God, my mum isn\u2019t here\u2026\u201d\n\nControversy over ex-Big Brother housemate\u2019s home \u2018invasion\u2019\n\nOn August 23, 2021, a former BBNaija housemate, Dorathy Bachor, raised the alarm that EFCC operatives broke into her Lekki apartment, saying they were after some suspects who ran into her estate.\n\nWhen the matter went viral on social media, the EFCC, in a statement, admitted they were its operatives, but that they broke in after Bachor\u2019s sister refused them entry.\n\nAccording to the commission, nine suspected internet fraudsters were arrested in the building.\n\nThe Enugu incident\n\nOn September 17, 2021, officials of the State of Security Services (SSS) in Enugu State averted what could have been a major protest against the EFCC following its operatives\u2019 arrest of student and youth leaders at a security meeting in Enugu.\n\nThe Nation reported that EFCC operatives invaded a hotel off Ogui Road, Castle Majestic where leaders of Ohaneze Ndigbo Youth Wing, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Nigerian Youth Congress (NYC), Association of South East Town Union Youth wing (ASETU) and the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) were holding a meeting over the current insecurity issues in the region.\n\nThe youth leaders, numbering over 80 from across the Southeast region, were also lodged in the hotel when officials of the anti-graft agency were alleged to have raided the venue, shooting sporadically and bursting into their rooms.\n\nThe EFCC officials, eyewitnesses alleged, manhandled, teargassed and marched the youth and all the hotel guests into seven waiting Coaster buses, which drove them to the EFCC office in Enugu.\n\nAddressing journalists on the incident, Deputy President, National Youth Council of Nigeria, Comrade Innocent Nduanya, described the incident as crude and unacceptable to the youth of the Southeast.\n\nHe demanded a written apology from the commission within 48 hours.\n\nBut the EFCC described the raid of the hotel and two others in Monarch area and New Haven Extension in Enugu metropolis as a sting operation from which it arrested 16 suspected internet fraudsters.\n\nA statement by Uwujaren said the suspects were arrested following verified intelligence on their alleged involvement in internet-related fraud activities.\n\n\u201cPart of the intelligence indicated that suspected internet fraudsters were operating from Castle Majestic Hotel, Enugu. Based on the intelligence, and weeks of surveillance, a search warrant was executed on the facility on Thursday September 16, 2021.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the operation, the operatives encountered a group that identified themselves as members of the National Association of Nigerian students, NANS and Ohaneze Ndi Igbo Youth wing. The leaders of the group duly identified their members and carried on with their activities.\n\n\u201cBut the target of the sting operation were arrested and brought to the Enugu Zonal Command for questioning.\u201d\n\nHotelier laments\n\nCelia Suites, Abeokuta, one of the hotels invaded by EFCC operatives on September 14, 2021 in Ogun State accused the agency of harassing its guests.\n\nIdowu Mosope, the hotel\u2019s compliance officer, told journalists in Abeokuta that the agency\u2019s operatives threatened its staff at gunpoint.\n\nMosope said the operatives, numbering about 25 and fully armed, stormed the hotel in \u201ca commando-like manner,\u201d went to the hotel\u2019s front office and threatened workers, at gunpoint, to lead them to the CCTV.\n\nHe also said the operatives went to the hotel\u2019s server room and seized their gadgets and DVR.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they collected hotel master cards, they did not allow our staff to lead them, they were opening the rooms one after the other with the master cards,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, some of their lodgers lamented that \u201cthe EFCC operatives forcefully entered their rooms and met many of them naked,\u201d adding that the guests had threatened to press charges against the hotel over the invasion.\n\nThe EFCC in a statement, a day earlier, accused hotel owners of providing an enabling environment for internet fraudsters and blocking their operatives from arresting them.\n\n\u2018 Gestapo tactics\u2019\n\nThese and several more incidents around the country have led to accusations that the anti-graft agency was deploying \u2018Gestapo\u2019 tactics against innocent people in its fervour to nab fraudsters.\n\nChallenges of sting operations\n\nIn law enforcement, a sting operation is a deceptive operation designed to catch a person committing a crime. A typical sting will have an undercover law enforcement officer, detective, or co-operative member of the public play a role as criminal partner or potential victim and go along with a suspect\u2019s actions to gather evidence of the suspect\u2019s wrongdoing.\n\nLike in Nigeria, sting operations are common in many other countries, but they are not permitted in some countries, such as Sweden or France.\n\nSome other countries also have prohibitions on conducting certain types of sting operations \u2013 such as in the Philippines, where it is illegal for law enforcers to pose as drug dealers to apprehend buyers of illegal drugs.\n\nSting operations are, however, fraught with ethical concerns. Law enforcement may also have to be careful not to provoke the commission of a crime by someone who would not otherwise have done so. Additionally, in the process of such operations, law enforcement agents often engage in the same crimes.\n\nMuch of the complaints against EFCV\u2019s sting operations have to do with invasion of privacy, rights violations, assault and lack of courtesy.\n\nEFCC: Claims of Gestapo-like tactics untrue\n\nBut Uwujaren told The Nation that the allegations against the EFCC were mostly exaggerated.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe narrative about the Commission\u2019s operation being Gestapo-like, is worrisome because it is far removed from reality.\n\n\u201cEFCC is one agency that places great emphasis on responsible conduct by its operatives and have clearly defined Standard Operating Procedure that guides its investigative activities.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Commission would not embark on any sting operation without a valid warrant. Such exercise are usually based on intelligence.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the EFCC spokesperson admitted the operatives sometimes make mistakes.\n\n\u201cIntelligence is not precision science. Error could occur, and do occur. But where you carry out over a thousand sting operations and one or two record incidents, such incidents should be considered as isolated occurrence and not a pattern that should be used to stigmatise an agency.\n\n\u201cThat two or three persons complain about the mode of entry into their facilities by operatives of the Commission should not transform the EFCC into a Gestapo Organisation. Who is that Yahoo boy that will welcome operatives of the EFCC into his apartment with open arms?\u201d Uwujaren said.\n\nHe made another poser. He said: \u201cWhere credible intelligence and surveillance pinpoint the exact location of a cybercrime suspect, and there is need for arrest to be made, should the commission hands up in despair because the suspect refused access to operatives?\n\n\u201cWhat will be the public\u2019s response were the EFCC to claim that it is failing in the task of fighting internet fraud because fraudsters will not allow them access into their property?\n\n\u201cEFCC as a responsible agency, recognises the right of citizens, even internet suspects. But the law that offers rights to citizens also invest the commission with power to apply minimum force where it is denied access to any facility by suspects of crime.\u201d\n\nEFCC sting operations usually occur in the wee hours, but that should not be a problem, the spokesman argued.\n\nHe said: \u201cFurthermore, the timing of the commission\u2019s operation is not one that should bother anyone. Every crime has its peculiar dynamics and those saddled with enforcement responsibilities have the technical know-how to determine tactics.\n\n\u201cFor an agency that tracks criminals who operates in the cyberspace, EFCC deserves credit, not condemnation, for its relentless assault on internet fraudsters whose activities attract nothing but odium for the country globally.\u201d",

We have enough problems in the APC already\u201d.\n\nThe Minister, while later alluding to the encomiums poured on Wike by Tunji-Ojo following his performance in Rivers, however, made a U-turn saying he could only declare Wike a performing Governor if he joined the APC.\n\nTo Wike, he said: \u201cBecause you are not yet in APC, I won\u2019t call you a performing Governor. When you come over to the APC, I will call you a performing Governor\u201d.\n\nBut Wike, who spoke immediately after Akpabio, wondered why the Minister turned the inauguration into a political campaign.\n\nThe Governor, juxtaposing the crises in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the APC, said he would not leave \u201cwhere there is malaria to a place where there is cancer\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI thought we came to inaugurate this project. I didn\u2019t know Akpabio will turn it into a political campaign. I prefer to stay where there is malaria to where there is cancer. Malaria is treatable but cancer at the fourth stage is not treatable. I don\u2019t want to die now\u201d.\n\nWike, who refused to acknowledge Akpabio as a Minister in his order of protocol, referred to him as a former Governor.\n\nHe said Akpabio enjoyed the title, uncommon, when he was a Governor under the PDP.\n\nHe said: \u201cAkpabio, you became uncommon Governor under the PDP.

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy is in a dire strait as oil price hit $80.20 yesterday amid growing demand fuelled by a return to opening of economies around the world.\n\nHowever, the development has put Nigeria at crossroads. While the country makes more revenue from oil sales, the gains appear to be filtered away through fuel subsides as the country through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation( NNPC) imports 100 per cent of petrol consumed locally at 56 million litres daily\n\nAccording to data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the corporation incurred N756.99 billion petrol subsidy cost from January to July this year, a figure that may likely hit N1 trillion by December if oil price continues to rally.\n\nThe surge may not be unconnected with Hurricane Ida\u2019s landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as a Category 4 hurricane. As a result of the hurricane, 96 per cent of crude oil production and 94 per cent of natural gas production in the U.S. federally administered areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) were shut in.\n\nAccording to estimates by the U.S. Department of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, at least nine refineries shut down or reduced production, leading to reduced forecast for crude oil production and refinery runs in September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\n\nThe GOM accouns for 15 per cent of U.S. crude oil production. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that global oil demand will move to 108 million barrels per day(bpd), up from where it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Government had in March 2020 removed petrol subsidy after reducing the pump price of the product to N125 per litre from N145 following the sharp drop in crude oil prices.\n\nThe landing cost of petrol imported into the country increased to a new high of N249.42 per litre on July 30 from N240.17 per litre as of June 25.\n\nData from the corporation showed that it incurred N25.37billion subsidy in January, N60.40billion in February, N111.97bn in March, and N126.30bn in April and N114.34bn in May.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Wants National Assembly to revisit Electoral Act\n\n*Says commission not subordinate to NCC\n\n*Saraki asks legislature to act in national interest\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has asked the National Assembly to revisit the Electoral Act amendment bill, assuring that it has the capacity and technical knowhow to undertake electronic transmission of election results throughout the country. INEC declared that it was not subordinate to the National Communication Commission (NCC) or answerable to any government agency.\n\nIn a similar development, former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, advised members of the Joint Conference Committee of the National Assembly to move fast in considering the different versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill passed by both chambers and let their decisions be guided only by national interest.\n\nThat was as the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, a coalition of over 70 organisations, asked the Senate to quickly resolve the conflicting aspects of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill so as to save the country from long-drawn litigations and uncertainty, which could put INEC\u2019s preparations for the elections in jeopardy.\n\nINEC called on the Senate and House of Representatives to quickly amend Sections 63, 65 and other relevant sections of the Electoral Act, which bar the commission from collation of election results electronically. It insisted that electronic transmission of results was doable, and it would guarantee safety, honesty and transparency.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, insisted that the electronic transmission of results real time was the best guarantee of transparency.\n\nSpeaking in a television programme monitored in Abuja on Monday, Okoye said INEC was determined to use electronic devices to improve Nigeria\u2019s electoral process, and deliver free, fair and credible elections. Okoye said for such to become a reality, the National Assembly must show courage by amending the relevant sections of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough INEC is increasingly tilting towards the use of technology to deliver a free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria, we want the National Assembly to amend the law, which prescribed the method elections are being conducted at the moment.\u201d\n\nOkoye admitted that INEC was still using the manual method, as enshrined in the Electoral Act, by collating election results from the Polling Units (PU), using Form EC8A, and Registration Area Collation Centre (RACC), with Form EC8B up to local government areas, and using Form EC8C to collate results, which are computed manually before announcement.\n\nOkoye maintained that INEC had perfected the use of technology to conduct elections starting from the 2023 general election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFor us to alter the methodology, the Electoral Act must be changed to accommodate the new innovations. We want National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act to enable INEC deliver a more transparent, fair and credible elections that will meet the aspirations of Nigerians. They should also look at 51, 52, 53 and 57 of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWe are already uploading election results electronically but we will need the relevant sections of the Electoral Act to be amended to avoid litigations, because INEC doesn\u2019t want our election winners to be determined by the law courts.\u201d\n\nOkoye said the commission was not answerable to NCC or any other federal government organ in carrying out its constitutional duties, saying INEC has inherent powers to conduct elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cNobody can bully INEC to share its powers given by the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria of Nigeria. Section 160 of Nigerian constitution mandates INEC to give NCC duties to perform, not NCC giving INEC orders.\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 52 of Electoral Act gives INEC inherent powers to conduct elections in any manner it wants, including e-voting. Again, the 2015 Electoral Act (as amended), which was signed by the former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has given INEC unfettered powers to conduct elections in the best method available.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the present method of manual collation of election results from PU, RACC and LGA should be done away with, adding, \u201cWith the introduction of Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) and other devices by INEC, elections in Nigeria can only get better, hence, National Assembly should join in deepening Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Saraki said in a statement by the head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, that the harmonisation of the versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill and its eventual passage should be concluded in time so that the law could be assented to before the political process leading to the 2023 general election. He said the success of the next round of elections would depend on the existence of a new enabling law with relevant provisions that would guarantee a credible, free, fair and peaceful process.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThat is why it is important that members of the Conference Committee should strive hard to rise above partisan and personal considerations. They should take decisions solely based on national interest and the need to strengthen our electoral process. The country is bigger than our various political parties. Nigeria is even bigger than any individual or any loyalty we may have to an individual.\n\n\u201cThat is why members of the committee should give genuine and deep consideration to the delicate issue of adopting the provision on electronic transmission of results, which will help to strengthen our electoral process, deepen our democracy and improve the level of participation in the elections.\n\n\u201cYour assignment is very crucial to the future of our country and if through your work we get a good law that will help in reforming the political process, you will be completing a great circle in the building of a legacy. It is a circle that started, when the immediate past National Assembly passed the same bill and only failed to get presidential assent, because of the politics of the period.\n\n\u201cI want to remind members of the respective hallowed and honourable chambers that at this point in our national history, we cannot fail to seize the opportunity that this bill presents to us to enthrone a credible and transparent electoral process. Whatever you do as you consider this bill is your own role in making history, in saving our democracy and building a future that is stable and progressive, where elected leaders truly represent the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that even after leaving the National Assembly, I have consistently canvassed the need for us to quickly pass a new Electoral Act that will include important provisions aimed at developing our electoral system. On one occasion in September 2020, during a webinar conference on \u2018Electoral Reforms and Democracy\u2019 organised by Centre for Advancement of Civil Liberties, I called on Nigerians to continue to create awareness on the importance of the Bill ahead of the 2023 elections\n\n\u201cAt this point, I need to appreciate the efforts of young people across the country, who went round spending their time and resources to create events aimed at generating awareness on the Bill, all members of the National Assembly, who have made sacrifices to get us this far, various development partners, civil society groups, members of the press and other stakeholders who played different roles in getting the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill to the semi-final stage, where it is almost getting to the point of becoming an effective Act of Parliament. We must continue to improve our system until we achieve the real objective of \u2018One Man, One Vote\u2019 and where the votes of the electorate count.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room said the version of the Electoral Act Amendment bill stipulating the recommendation of NCC before transmission of results electronically was a breach of the constitution. Convener of the group, Ene Obi, said at a news conference on Monday in Abuja that this would not augur well for democracy in the country. Obi insisted that the power to determine the procedure for transmission of results should be vested with INEC.\n\nThe Situation Room and its European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), its implementing partners, called on the National Assembly to show selflessness during the harmonisation.\n\nIt stated, \u201cNotwithstanding the landmark proposals in the on-going review process, civil society partners and key stakeholders have identified about 17 points of divergence in the versions of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the National Assembly. These are the use of smart card readers, deployment of electronic voting, collation and transmission of results, cost of campaigns, process of nomination of candidates, among others.\n\n\u201cAs expressed by a vast majority of electoral stakeholders and Nigerians, we are concerned by these identified differences in the proposals, particularly, regarding electronic transmission of results and deployment of technological devices.\n\n\u201cFollowing from our experience and observations of elections in recent years, as well as widely held views by Nigerians, we expect the harmonisation committee to accept the version of the bill that allows INEC to determine the mode of conduct of elections, including transmission of results.\u201d\n\nObi said INEC had shown that it had adequate capacity to use technology in elections, including the transmission of results.\n\nEne added that INEC\u2019s capability had been proven during the off-circle elections and through its use of the Z-pad and more recently, the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nAnother member of the Situation Room, Cynthia Mbamalu, said the group recommended the adoption of the senate version of clause 43, which recognised that INEC could use voting devices alongside election materials.\n\nIn addition, Mbamalu said, the group urged the harmonisation committee to adopt the Senate\u2019s version of clause 49, which recognised the use of other technological devices alongside smart card readers for voter accreditation. She added that the House of Representatives version of clause 52 should be adopted, as it gave INEC the power to determine the procedure for voting and transmission of election results.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Another eight killed in reprisal attack\n\n*State government confirms casualties\n\n*How ISWAP invaded Sokoto military base, murdered 15 officers\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nIn a brazen new onslaught, bandits on Sunday slaughtered 34 people, including a family of 13, following attacks on Madamai and Abun communities in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Eight persons sustained various degrees of injury, while the terrorists burnt down about 20 houses.\n\nThe attacks came roughly 24 hours after another set of terrorists suspected to be members of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) attacked a joint military base, codenamed \u201cBurkusuma camp\u201d, in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, reportedly, killing 15 soldiers, three Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers, and a police man.\n\nThere was, also, a reprisal attack in Kacecere village in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, which claimed another eight lives.\n\nConfirming the development, the Kaduna State government said the reprisal attack was fuelled by the attack that claimed the lives of 34 people and the destruction of houses by the terrorists.\n\nThe Nigeria Army, yesterday, confirmed that ISWAP attacked its base in Sabon Birni, Sokoto State.\n\nRev. Father Michael Magaji of the Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan, in Kaduna State, who confirmed the invasion of the two communities late Sunday night by gunmen, told THISDAY by telephone that the communities were about five kilometres from Kafanchan town. Magaji said most of those killed were women and children. He said the gunmen shot sporadically as they arrived the villages, killing 32 people.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am in the hospital as I speak with you. We have brought 32 corpses for embalmment. We have eight people injured and they are receiving treatment. About 20 houses were burnt, 13 persons from the same family were killed. We intend to have a mass burial to call the attention of the world to what is happening to our people.\u201d\n\nThe senator for Southern Kaduna, Danjuma La\u2019ah, condemned the attack and lamented the persistent attacks in the area, which had led to the killing of hundreds of people.\n\nLa\u2019ah appealed to the people of the area to remain calm and avoid taking the law into their hands. He also called on the authorities concerned to scale up security in the area to avoid further attacks and destruction of lives and property.\n\n\u201cIf government refuses to take proactive measures to address the issue, the people will be left with no option than to embark on self-defence,\u201d the senator said.\n\nIn a separate statement confirming the reprisal attack yesterday, Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, blamed the reprisal attack that led to the deaths of eight people on the killing of the 34 people in Madamai village, Kaura Local Government Area, and one Yakubu Danjuma in Kacecere village in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cThe Kaduna State government has received reports from security agencies of an attack by unidentified persons in Kacecere village, Zangon Kataf LGA, which has resulted in the deaths of some citizens.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, this attack was in reprisal to earlier attacks in Jankasa village, Zangon Kataf LGA, where one Mr. Yakubu Danjuma was killed, and also in Madamai in Kaura LGA where 34 persons were killed.\u201d\n\nHe said security agencies reported that the attacks in the two locations \u201cled to the reprisal by unidentified assailants on Kacecere community, which has left eight dead, six persons injured and several houses razed.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, unidentified gunmen attacked Madamai village in Kaura local government. The troops mobilised to the location and also came under fire before forcing the assailants to withdraw after an intense exchange (of fire.\n\n\u201cSome houses were set ablaze by the attackers at one end of the village. The troops put out the fire at three of the burning houses, and rescued six locals from the infernos. As of the time of this update, 34 residents have been confirmed dead following the attack.\u201d\n\nAruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai had expressed deep sadness at the reports and offered his condolences to the families of the deceased.\n\nThe commissioner said, \u201cThe governor appealed for recourse to the law and urged communities to eschew reprisals and similar violent actions. He also tasked security agencies to conduct thorough investigations into the incident. As of the time of this update, troops and police personnel are working in the locations and the public will be briefed after official reports are received.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said two suspects had been arrested in connection with the killings.\n\n\u201cGovernor El-Rufai has stated that the Kaduna State Government will bear the full cost of injured victims\u2019 treatment,\u201d Aruwan stated.\n\nHe said the governor had also been briefed by security agencies on the roles played by the Chief of Kagoro, His Royal Highness, Chief Ufuwai Bonet, and the lawmaker representing Kaura Federal Constituency, Hon. Gideon Gwani, in dousing tension and preventing a breakdown of law and order following the unfortunate incident.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe governor commended their efforts and sterling leadership. The governor ordered an urgent assessment of the area by the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency, towards the provision of succour to the affected households.\n\n\u201cThe governor received the reports with intense grief, and expressed his condemnation of the gruesome attack, which he described as an unspeakable display of wickedness, meriting the severest form of punishment.\n\n\u201cHe further tasked security agencies to ensure urgent and precise investigations into the horrific incident.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that \u201ctwo suspects are being questioned in connection with the attack\u201d and security agencies were conducting operations in the general area, promising, \u201cThe government will update citizens accordingly.\u201d\n\nOn the attack on the Sokoto military base at the weekend, villagers and security sources told THISDAY that the assault happened in the early hours of Friday.\n\nThe terrorists, THISDAY gathered, came in large numbers and started shooting at the camp from different angles.\n\nA military source, which was not authorised to speak on the matter, said a large number of suspected bandits were killed when a military base was attacked in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto.\n\nThe source did not confirm if the military camp was the same as the Burkusuma camp in Sabo Birni local government.\n\nA former chairman of Sabon Birni Local Government Area, Idris Muhammad Gobir, known as Danchadi, also confirmed to newsmen that the Burkusuma camp was attacked and several security operatives in the camp were still missing.\n\nGobir said the marauding terrorists burnt down two patrol vehicles and carted away another one, which was used to convey food items stolen from the villagers.\n\nThe former chairman said the report of the attack was confirmed to them by a resident of Burkusuma, who used a mobile telecommunications service from Niger Republic.\n\nA prominent traditional ruler in the area also confirmed that some vehicles were sent to evacuate corpses of those killed. He said over 10 trucks conveying armed military personnel were at the moment in the forest trailing the bandits.\n\nAn NSCDC personnel, who also pleaded anonymity, confirmed that three of their members were among the casualties.\n\nThe gunmen also reportedly attacked Katsira village and shot four persons. Two of the victims were said to have died instantly while the other two were taken to an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe gunmen were said to have abducted three persons from the village.\n\nThe spokesman of the 8 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major Yahaya Ngulde, could not be reached for comments on the developments.\n\nSimilarly, Police Public Relation Officer, ASP Sanusi Abubakar, said he was not aware of the attack.\n\nBut the military, while confirming the story in a press release by Director, Defence Information, Maj Gen Benjamin Olufemi Sawyer, said Operation Hadarin Daji troops successfully repelled the attack. Sawyer said in the process, scores of insurgents were eliminated while others fled with bullet wounds to Niger Republic. He disclosed that the attack took place at Burkusuma in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nSawyer further disclosed that aggressive operations of troops of the FOB, as witnessed in recent months in the North-west, had been a thorn in the flesh of ISWAP and bandits. He said the attackers came in large numbers using telecom network provided from neighbouring country, and capitalised on the lean rear area protection force, when the main troops were out conducting offensive operations within their area of responsibility.\n\nSawyer, however, stated that the swift reinforcement by troops helped to counter the attack, as many of the ISWAP fighters were eliminated while some scrambled with various degrees of injury, resulting in their pursuit to Bassira in Niger Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, he said, there was some level of casualty recorded on the part of the troops during the encounter but refused to give figures.\n\nThe Nigerian and Nigerien forces, in a collaborative operation, Sawyer hinted, had begun to trail the remaining ISWAP fighters, while the general security within the FOB and its environs had been stabilised.\n\nA medical personnel said on condition of anonymity that they brought 15 corpses of soldiers to specialist hospitals Sokoto yesterday.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government condemned the attack on military base in the state. Commissioner for Security and Career Studies, Col. Garba Moyi, said the attack was barbaric and unwarranted\n\nMoyi stated that the attack would not deter security agencies in the bid to safeguard the country from insurgents.\n\nMoyi noted that the government and the people of Sokoto State sympathised with Nigerian Army and other agencies that suffered casualties in the incident. He reiterated the state government\u2019s commitment to supporting the security agencies in their determination to win the war against the insurgents.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Condemn statement by the southern govs that power must move to south\n\n*Oppose states\u2019 collection of VAT, say it will lead to multiple taxation\n\nJohn Shiklam\n\nThe fault lines of a divided nation came to the fore yesterday, with the Northern States Governors Forum, (NSGF), umbrella body of 19 elected governors of the, north signaling its determination to press its advantage and retain power in 2023, against the mood of the southern part of the country which has insisted that power must shift to the south.\n\nThe NSGF rose from a meeting in Kaduna yesterday to state its position affirming its right to stake claim to the presidency in 2023.\n\nIt condemned the position of the Southern Governors Forum (SGF), stating that it contradicts \u201cthe provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that an elected President shall: score the majority votes; score at least 25 per cent of the votes cast in two-third of the states of the federation.\u201d\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their joint meeting with Northern Traditional Rulers in Kaduna yesterday, the governors also spoke on the on-going controversy over the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), declaring that it is \u201cbeing confused by Rivers and Lagos state governments as a sales tax.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, which was read by the chairman of the forum and governor of Plateau State, Mr. Simon Lalong, also insisted that the position of the southern governors on power shift contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Forum observed that some Northern States Governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to three geo-political zones in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 stated that the meeting considered the on-going national debate on the collection of VAT, stating, \u201cAs responsible leaders, while we are constrained by the fact that the matter is subjudice, we, however, for the purposes of educating the public, make the following observations: the judgement of the Federal High Court calls to question the constitutionality of VAT, withholding tax, education tax, Niger Delta Development Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, 13 per cent derivation, National Economic Development Council and many other currently levied and collected by the federal government, Federal Inlands Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cRivers and Lagos State governments had enacted their own VAT laws and the Southern Governors Forum has expressed support for this course of action; VAT is being confused by these state governments as a sales tax.\u201d\n\nThe northern governors argued further, \u201cIf every state enacted its own VAT law, multiple taxation will result in increases of prices of goods and services and collapsed in interstate trade.\n\n\u201cVAT is not a production tax like excise, but terminal tax which is paid by the ultimate consumer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governors, \u201cAnother confusion is ignoring observation above and its \u2018overall effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey pointed out that the reason Lagos State accounted for over 50 per cent VAT collection was because most of the telecommunication companies, banks, manufacturing and other trading activities have their headquarters in the state, \u201cwith the resultant and wrongful attribution of VAT.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added, \u201cUntil and unless the Supreme Court pronounces judgement on the substantive matter between Rivers State and Federal Government, the matter is subjudice and Northern States Governors Forum would respect this.\u201d\n\nThe governors also decried what they described as \u201cthe high level of conspiracies being perpetrated by some judicial officers in releasing or granting bail to arrested criminals, maintaining that, \u201cthis attitude sabotages the fight against criminality.\u201d\n\nThe governors reviewed security situation in the North and called for a sustained synergy and coordinated efforts between the federal and the northern states governments to tackle the situation.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also noted with concern the constraint of the security services and urged the Armed Forces to embark on simultaneous operations, and\u2026assured of their readiness to work in synergy with the federal government in finding lasting solution to the current security challenges,\u201d the forum added.\n\nFurthermore, the governors commended the on-going onslaught against banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram, especially in the North-east, North-west, and North-central geopolitical zones.\n\nThe governors called on the security agencies to live up to their responsibility and urged traditional rulers to mobilise their various communities to check the ugly trend of criminality in their domains.\n\nThe governors lamented the ugly trend in the spread of drugs and consumption among the youth and called on governments and communities to rise to the occasion and stem the tide.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 urged the federal government to expedite action on the National Livestock Transformation Programme as a springboard in transiting from the open grazing system as widely practised in the North.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the governors of Plateau, Kaduna, Sokoto, Nasarawa, Borno, Jigawa, Gombe, and the deputy governor of Kano State. Also at the meeting was the Chairman of the Northern Traditional Rulers Council, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, and the emirs of Zazzau, Bauchi, and Kano.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Researchers at a new bionics centre established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plan to pilot a mobile imaging and delivery system of prosthetic limb services for disabled Sierra Leoneans.\n\nThe project \u2013 meant to ensure patients in medically underserved communities have access to prostheses \u2013 is listed as one of the four priorities for the research centre set up with $24 million in funding from philanthropist Lisa Yang.\n\nA statement released by MIT reveals that investigators will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customized prosthetics to disabled individuals.\n\nThe service will initially roll out in rural Sierra Leone, a West African country where thousands of people suffered amputations during an 11-year civil war. According to estimates, roughly 27,000 Sierra Leoneans were disabled or had one or more of their limbs amputated during the 1991-2002 war.\n\nMIT adds that while the population of people with amputated limbs continues to increase each year in Sierra Leone, less than 10% of that population currently benefits from functional prostheses.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThrough the mobile delivery system, a key centre objective is to scale up production and access of functional limb prostheses for Sierra Leoneans in dire need,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nSierra Leone President, Julius Maada Bio, describes the mobile prosthetics service fueled by the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics as \u201can innovative solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nThe MIT project aligns with President Bio\u2019s plans to make Sierra Leone a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the first things he did after assuming office in 2017 was set up a Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) led by David Moinina Sengeh, the country\u2019s first-ever chief innovation officer who doubles as the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education.\n\nSengeh is an MIT and Harvard inventor whose research work to improve prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone will be leveraged by the MIT bionics centre.\n\nA crucial figure in the government\u2019s digitisation drive, he\u2019s introduced President Bio to TED Talks and tech activities at the universities of Oxford, Yale, and Harvard.\n\nOver the past four years, the President has participated in dialogues centered around using innovation and technology to transform food systems in Africa; given presentations on blockchain and the fourth industrial revolution; as well as visited MIT, where he detailed plans to make his nation a digital centre.\n\n\u201cI am proud that Sierra Leone will be the first site for deploying this state-of-the-art digital design and fabrication process,\u201d Bio said.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a government that promotes innovative technologies and prioritizes human capital development, I am overjoyed that this pilot project will give Sierra Leoneans (especially in rural areas) access to quality limb prostheses and thus improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nMore on the bionics centre\n\nThe K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics will be run by Hugh Herr, an MIT professor and double amputee. Broadly, it aims to develop technologies and surgical methods to mitigate disability because of injury, aging, or disease using interdisciplinary research.\n\nExperts from three MIT schools \u2013 Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Planning \u2013 as well as clinical and surgical collaborators at Harvard Medical School, are expected to work together at the new centre.\n\nFurthermore, the center will provide four endowed fellowships for MIT graduate students working in bionics or other research areas focused on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe new K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, made possible by a US$24 million gift from philanthropist Lisa Yang (center), will be led by Hugh Herr, professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab (left), and Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT (right). Image source: MIT News\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to support MIT on this major research effort to enable powerful new solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals who experience disability,\u201d said Yang, a former investment banker and a major supporter in autism research at MIT and Cornell University, among other institutions.\n\n\u201cThis new commitment extends my philanthropic investment into the realm of physical disabilities, and I look forward to the centre\u2019s positive impact on countless lives.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "The Chinese government plans to distribute digital satellite television and hardware in 200 villages across Togo, speeding up the West African country\u2019s plans to switch to digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting.\n\nDTT, which will replace analog television, is a technology that improves image quality and reduces operating costs inherent in broadcasting. In October 2019, the Togolese parliament passed a law authorising the DTT migration, a process that began a few years before the regulation was approved.\n\nThe project was expected to kick off with the construction of nine digital television signal transmission sites. However, it has stalled as DTT coverage in the French-speaking country remains low, and non-existent in rural areas. On paper, the Chinese intervention could ease Togo\u2019s transition from analog to digital satellites.\n\nChina\u2019s deputy trade minister Qian Keming said late last month the Asian powerhouse was \u201ccommitted to assisting in the implementation of this programme\u201d in Togo.\n\nThe Chinese project will cover more than a third of villages in the country, which is one of the smallest by land area and population in Africa with approximately 8 million people.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe 10,000 Villages Project\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s provision of satellite TV in Togo is part of a more extensive program in Africa, through which 10,000 villages in 20 countries are expected to receive DTT kits, with the aim of reducing the digital divide in rural Africa.\n\nSelected villages get solar-powered projector TVs, digital TV sets, satellite dishes, and decoders where they can watch 20 international and local channels free of charge. Local technicians also receive training on the installation and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nChinese media conglomerate StarTimes, contracted for the project, carried out the installation in neighboring West African countries Benin and Nigeria, where the company claims to have equipped public areas with satellite reception kits in 200 and 1,000 villages respectively. The same deployment was done in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nChinese presence in Africa\u2019s media\n\nStarTimes is one of the most popular pay-TV operators on the continent. Although it is technically a private company with no known government affiliation, the pay-TV operator plays a vital role in China\u2019s diplomacy push in Africa.\n\nChina\u2019s significant presence and influence in Africa, mainly in the areas of infrastructure development and trade, has expanded to include the media sector. Over the years, Beijing has invested significantly in the African media landscape, through projects like the DTT coverage.\n\nSeveral Chinese media organisations also boast a significant presence on the continent.\n\nThe state-funded Xinhua News Agency established a regional office in Nairobi in 2006 with a massive foreign correspondent network in Africa. It currently allows local media outlets to get content via its newswire without charge.\n\nThe China Global Television Network (CGTN) also has an African bureau headquartered in the Kenya capital, where it offers free and reduced broadcasting to television providers.\n\nBoth the China Daily publication and China Radio International have bureaus in Nairobi as well.\n\nA major aspect of StarTimes\u2019 ambitions in Africa is its ability to promote state broadcasters from the Asian nation, enabling easier access to Chinese content \u2013 from soap operas to news programmes. For instance, it broadcasts CGTN for free and offers the station with every subscription package.\n\nHowever, not all content on the platform is Chinese-produced. In addition to broadcasting Chinese and African national channels, StarTimes produces its own content in local languages, including Swahili, from its production facility in Nairobi.\n\nIn some ways, China\u2019s presence in the African media landscape has benefitted the region. The investment in the media industry has reportedly created hundreds of jobs and provided international training courses to many journalists, often in China.\n\nBut the Asian power\u2019s increasing investment in African media is seen as a strategy to positively shape its image, which is key to achieving Beijing\u2019s longer-term ambitions.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Source: TechCabal\n\nSeptember 27th, 2021.\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nOn Friday, towards the end of the Future of Commerce conference, I got into a chat with my colleague Damilare about his plans for the weekend. It included resting, hanging out with friends and watching some shows on Netflix.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention was him mentioning that he recently paid for a Netflix subscription. What made him make the switch? The recently released King of Boys series.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t sit out and miss out, so I had to. After all, it\u2019s just \u20a61,200 ($3),\u201d he said.\n\nMy first thought was that Damilare\u2019s sign up was an indication that Netflix\u2019s content strategy is making a difference. But when I thought about it again, I remembered that he signed up for the recently introduced mobile-only plan that costs 50% less than the standard plan.\n\nHis sign up is still a win for the streaming service but also a reminder that irrespective of how much people love Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, there are other competing priorities on this side of the world. To take a step further, there\u2019s an army of people whose mantra is free content or nothing.\n\nA screenshot of a blog comment section interaction between Kemi Adetiba (director and writer of King of Boys) and a few Nigerians who don\u2019t believe the series shouldn\u2019t exist behind Netflix\u2019s paywall.\n\nPartner Message\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today?\n\nSource: Flutterwave\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here.\n\nAnswered prayers\n\nThis realization is most likely what influenced Netflix\u2019s decision to introduce a free plan in Kenya this week. Clearly, the $3.99 (mobile-only plan) is still too much to ask of Africans.\n\nUnlike the typical 30 days trial which gives users access to Netflix\u2019s full library for a limited time, in this free plan Netflix is only making about one quarter of its movies and television shows catalog available.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the goal of the free plan is to reduce the friction in acquiring users, but it\u2019s not clear how long Netflix plans to offer this free in Kenya and whether it\u2019s considering expanding this offering to other markets.\n\nAmongst other players like Amazon prime video, Disney+ and Showmax, Netflix is expected to have the highest number of African subscribers in 2026 per Digital TV research. While Netflix has added a free content approach to its stack, what are other players doing?\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nPartner Message\n\n30%Club\n\nTake control of your investing journey.

The company stated that its goal is \u2018provide internet access to those who do not have access to fibre services\u2019. In simple terms, it\u2019s cheaper internet service coupled with access to DSTV\u2019s content. DSTV internet packages are about 60% cheaper than MTN regular data plans. For instance, 25 Gigabyte (GB) anytime and 25 GB Night-time data costs R229 ($15.35), while a similar package by MTN costs R599 ($40.16).\n\nAlthough there are questions around whether the internet plan is being subsidized by multichoice and how long they can continue doing this, it\u2019s a clever customer acquisition strategy.\n\nFor IROKOtv, a streaming service for Nollywood, it\u2019s betting on international markets since Africa hasn\u2019t provided the financial comfort it\u2019s looking for.\n\n\u201cAfrica is functionally poor\u2026@irokotv did a free movie a week for like 2-3 years. Tens of thousands of people used it weekly. <2% conversion.\u201d Jason Njoku, CEO of IROKOtv, said via Twitter in response to Netflix\u2019s decision to pivot to free. According to Jason, IROKOtv had to shut down the experiment when it was apparent that conversion was low and many users weren\u2019t interested in paying for a premium subscription.\n\nIROKOtv has been around for ten years and experimented with different tactics before deciding to pivot to focus more on its international market.\n\nMobolaji Adebayo \u2013 TechCabal Insights\n\nWhat does it take to succeed in Africa as a streaming service?\n\nWe\u2019ll start off with a low expectation of what success looks like because macro economic factors like disposable income, internet and smartphone penetration are low. After that we introduce cheap subscription plans and then create or acquire entertaining content to draw in new customers. This formula isn\u2019t complete until you sprinkle a lot of patience and luck because the journey is long and Africa is a different market.\n\nNetflix and Multichoice clearly have bigger purses than IROKOtv to persevere and try out a number of tactics hoping for a different result, but time will tell if more Africans will start paying for content.\n\nPartner Message\n\nStanford GSB\n\nNext on the Grit & Growth podcast: meet Elo Umeh, CEO of Terragon Group, a Nigerian marketing and insights firm, and experts from TLcom Capital, and learn how to maximise the value of your firm\u2019s next fundraising round.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a cool Tuesday afternoon in April 2011 in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s political and administrative capital, lawmakers of the upper chamber gathered in their usual outfits, typifying the country\u2019s rich cultural diversity.\n\nAt such regular meetings, lawmakers try to chart a course for Africa\u2019s largest nation. Rounds and rounds of endless debates are usually adjourned till another day when the cycle continues. But April 24, 2011, was different. The lawmakers had reached an era-defining decision.\n\nAmong other deliberations for that day, the National Assembly passed the Freedom of Information Act (FOI Act) after years of contemplation. Four days later, the then-president, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, assented to the bill, unlike former President, Olusegun Obasanjo who refused to pass it into law when it was first proposed in 1999.\n\nThis move came with a lot of commendation, especially from the press \u2014 the Fourth Estate of the Realm \u2014 as it\u2019s expected to promote press freedom, improve the citizens\u2019 general well-being, and develop democracy, as seen in Western climes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurious about the reason for the excitement?\n\nSimply put, the purpose of the Act is to make public records and information more readily available. That means custodians are compelled by law to provide public access to public records and information on request. It even goes as far as protecting serving public officers from adverse consequences of disclosing certain kinds of official information without authorisation.\n\nIs your local government working on a street light project in several towns and villages? You have a right to know the budget and contractors and even demand an explanation for any delays. What about how much the government collected in tax and how it was spent?\n\nThe underlying philosophy of FOI is that the population has the right to know what public servants, who are custodians of public trust, do.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is one of 11 countries with an FOI Act out of Africa\u2019s 54 nations. South Africa was the first to enact a Promotion of Access to Information Act in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven International bodies like the United Nations (UN) and the African Union (AU) often encourage an enabling environment to enact FOI laws while fostering active use by supporting social awareness.\n\nIdeally, this should mean that the continent is gradually embracing the freedom of information.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s the situation two decades on? A cursory look will show intermittent attempts to shut down free speech in these countries, coming via irregular unfair legislations and vetos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecognising or adopting the right to information might not be enough, and despite the efforts of international bodies, most governments only seem to pay lip service to these laws.\n\nIn 2020, nearly a decade after Nigeria passed its law, a Premium Times and UDEME investigation revealed that 16 Nigerian states were yet to establish processes to promote transparency in government.\n\nThis was confirmed after submitting 162 FOI requests across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states. Of 600 requests in 2 years, only 30% of the recipients treated their requests and disclosed information; the others either ignored the requests or provided no information after acknowledging them.\n\nThis means that public officials who violate these laws are obstacles to press freedom as they monopolise the power to make information public.\n\nViolating the FOI Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), FOI is an integral part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression, which covers the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.\n\nPer the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), infringement on this right includes, but is not limited to, violating press freedom and freedom of expression on the Internet.\n\nOn the latter, \u2018Internet\u2019 covers every other type of emerging media as long as it contributes to development, democracy, and dialogue.\n\nIronically, Africa lost approximately $454 million and 2,802 hours between January and August 2021 to several forms of government-imposed social media shutdowns and Internet blackouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactoring in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban, over 160 million Internet users have been affected, with Uganda, Chad, Senegal, Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan contributing to the total figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the bitter opposition to the Social Media Bill and Digital taxes in Africa has failed to halt proceedings.\n\nThe ordinary social media user and online tools adopters in Lesotho, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Togo, Tanzania, and Nigeria face hard times because of issues around regulations.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban isn\u2019t good for a country whose Digital Rights Bill is in limbo.\n\nThe government is aware that with a Social Media Bill successfully passed, moves against Internet use, for instance, become less controversial. And this also applies to digital taxes.\n\nInterestingly, policy research firm, Tech Hive Advisory, released a report in August 2021 which revealed that four countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ethiopia, Botswana, and Kenya \u2014 have laws ensuring freedom of expression and privacy for their citizens, as well as laws that violate them.\n\nSamuel Ibemere, Editor-in-Chief, Ripples Nigeria, confirms to Techpoint Africa that one viable trap of the government against press freedom is legislation.\n\nThe government looks for remotely applicable rules and proposes an amendment that promotes the agenda of censorship. And when this doesn\u2019t work, they act outside the law, circumventing it in the process.\n\nControversial reasons\n\nHover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers. You can also select the second option to see the number of Affected Internet users so far in 2021\n\nWe gathered that most of these shutdowns result from elections, protests, conflicts, information control, and national examination.\n\nBut in reality, it goes beyond that.\n\nData protection expert, CEO and Co-founder of Tech Hive Advisory, Ridwan Oloyede, explains to Techpoint Africa that information hoarding mostly occurs because of intolerance to accountability and transparency.\n\nDrawing upon his 35 years of experience in different capacities, veteran journalist Lekan Otufodunrin agrees and opines that in trying to evade the oath of office that they swore to uphold, they try to dictate what the media should report.\n\nHaving a platform to hold public office holders accountable and instruments to demand more from them might be the highest power ever handed to citizens. And incidentally, this is what is expected from democratic governments.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, putting the populace or the media in a situation they have no control over renders them helpless, which is what holders of public office seek to achieve.\n\nAs revealed by Dr Catherine Oyetunji-Alemede, a social psychologist, \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have access to information, they tend not to know what to do.\u201d\n\nShe further adds that \u201cnot knowing what to do takes you to a psychological state of learned helplessness.\u201d\n\nLearned helplessness conditions people to see bad situations as inescapable and unchangeable, such that it is passed down to the next generations. This is achieved by consistently portraying that a state of social helplessness is normal. This does not bode well for a country practising democracy.\n\nEveryone can be a watchdog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years and across different geographies, the media has served as watchdogs of the government and the \u2018powers that be\u2019 in society. For this reason, the media is regarded as the fourth estate of the realm, behind the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary.\n\nMembers of the press typically go above and beyond the call of duty, defying threats, risking bodily harm, and working with limited information.\n\nConsequently, no one can fault them for expecting positive change following the enactment of FOI laws. And in the digital age, the conversation is gradually changing.\n\nTemitope Olaiya Templer, News Editor, The Guardian Newspaper, says information hoarding has always been a major challenge for journalists, but the coping strategy has evolved with the times.\n\n\u201cI think this trend began when they saw the power of citizen media. Before now, it was easy to control broadcasts and prints, but online has been difficult to manage. And the more citizen journalists get on social media, the harder it is for the government to react.\u201d\n\nPer Ibemere, in the past, when print and broadcast houses were shut down, journalists had to go underground to keep distributing the news.\n\n\u201cToday, the government realises that the means of distribution is rapidly expanding beyond its control with the use of social media. So it\u2019s no surprise to see them try to shut down this new means of distribution. But for how long can the government continue this?\u201d\n\nIn the heat of the Twitter ban in June, Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, who shares similar sentiments, said that with more of the government\u2019s plan to retain and expand control comes more pushback from the populace as they become more exposed and enlightened.\n\nCitizen journalism encourages the \u2018see something, say something\u2019 culture, which has been used for election reporting. But surprisingly, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) of Nigeria reportedly fined three media firms not less than \u20a62 million ($5,263.1*) for reporting the October 20 #LekkiMasaccre using eyewitness reports\n\nThe NBC recently announced plans to license OTTs, but that wasn\u2019t the government\u2019s first attempt. NCC\u2019s similar moves in 2016 and 2019 were abandoned following opposition, and Sesan explained why this latest attempt would fall through.\n\n\u201cWhat the government hasn\u2019t done is to publish the details of the licence. But they can\u2019t because there\u2019s no licence like that. OTTs are not broadcasters; they are platforms, even though people use them for broadcasting. There\u2019s a reason they are called intermediaries.\u201d\n\nUndoing the muzzles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing deprived of information is close to some form of intellectual slavery. Also, being unable to access credible, fact-checked, and timely information in the time of emergency could be the difference between life and death,\u201d Oloyede says, stating why the media can\u2019t afford to be laid back in the face of information deprivation.\n\nHowever, the press can\u2019t be silenced.\n\nOtufodunrin, who is now the Executive Director of the Media Career Development Network (MCDN), discloses that before and during his time as the managing editor of The Nation Newspaper, he witnessed various forms of censorship but learnt how to cope while doing everything to reverse the situation.\n\n\u201cBefore the emergence of new media, there were traditional ways of practising journalism which are still reliable in going about our editorial work. The censorship can only limit our operations but can\u2019t totally stop us from doing our work,\u201d he tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nOlaiya sheds more light on this, saying that it\u2019s difficult but left to choose between going ahead with incomplete information because concerned authorities are not forthcoming or using anonymous third parties or persons of interest willing to compromise, journalists will pick the latter.\n\nFrom recent experiences, he establishes that using the FOI laws as an instrument to compel a response to requests isn\u2019t always as effective as it should be.\n\nWith this instrument becoming less effective, Oloyede maintains that there\u2019s more to be done.\n\n\u201cBeyond having a law in place, it\u2019s important to also put in place mechanisms to ensure that the laws do what they\u2019re meant to do. Like judges being trained on how they work. Government agencies or private organisations and businesses enjoying collaboration with the public authority have the capability to provide information to people when they request it.\u201d\n\nIn such situations, Olaiya often tells his team to \u201cstay with the facts\u201d while discarding emotions.\n\n\u201cWhen you stay with the facts, no matter the harassment, the trolling on social media, callout by government agents, and paid social media influencers, the facts will always speak,\u201d he adds.\n\nIbemere also alludes to instances where social media influencers and random people come to bash fact-driven investigative stories. Still, he points out neither the press nor the citizens should be forced into a situation where they can\u2019t hold the government accountable.\n\nOyetunji-Alamede highlights what this implies.\n\nFrom a decade of practice as a social psychologist in academia, she submits that the tendency for citizens to resort to revolution, anarchy, or extreme chaos increases with prolonged infringement on the right to information. Circumventing this sometimes makes people search for a less restrictive environment outside the country.\n\nThis brings to mind a radical investigative journalist, David Hundeyin, working from outside the country\u2019s shores.\n\nPlaying in the media space is dicey in Africa.\n\nOn the one hand, journalists must be very professional in their duties and abide by the profession\u2019s best practices. But on the other hand, sometimes they either make exemptions or do nothing.\n\nAccording to Olaiya, there\u2019s usually a negative outcome when a government consistently refers to select media outfits as purveyors of fake news because they present the facts they have in the face of insufficient information resulting from the withholding of pertinent details.\n\nThis threatens to weaken journalistic integrity and the authenticity of media reports. And if sustained, the media outfit loses its credibility per time.\n\nSince there are always two sides to a coin, some outfits play it safe and release teasers with the promise of more details to come. That this is bad for their image is a no-brainer.\n\nHowever, Ibemere says that the media still needs its independence to feed the populace with fact-checked information, which can be achieved notwithstanding current challenges.\n\nIn his opinion, \u201cWhat the media can do to overcome those obstructions is to also play within that legal space. We need to be able to identify what those obstructions are. We query those legislations.\n\n\u201cThe media is not irresponsible. We want to ensure that we live by the rules, and we\u2019re also aware that some of those rules have been deliberately instituted so that we don\u2019t enjoy any breathing space.\u201d\n\nInternational Day of Universal Access to Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs stated by the UN, the world recognises the significance of access to information on September 28, the International Day of Universal Access to Information.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme is \u201cThe Right to Know \u2013 Building Back Better with Access to Information.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, many African countries rank low on the World Press Freedom Index as far as their activities in 2021 are considered.\n\nEthiopia, for instance, ranks 101st, with Kenya just one place behind in the 102nd position. Nigeria sits in the 120th spot and Zimbabwe ten further in 130th.\n\nThis is despite these nations having existing FOI laws that should ordinarily entrench press freedom and the freedom of information.\n\nBeyond days like this, people living in Africa and the press are reminded to be bold enough to oppose guerilla legislations that violate their rights to timely and credible information.\n\nUltimately, Gbenga\u2019s parting words should ring loud: citizens shouldn\u2019t feel intimidated in the face of opposition. This is a democracy, and boldness is needed to push plans that will impact them positively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a cold night in June 2019. Like most nights, 15-year-old Chidiebere is walking the streets of Lagos. The air is stuffy as fumes of carbon monoxide emissions combine with the smell of sewage, leaving an unbearable stench.\n\nEveryone seems to be in a rush, going someplace. Prospective buyers converge on expectant sellers. Wanderers are roaming. The others can only care less. They just want to go home and get some sleep. It\u2019s been a long day.\n\nHome. This word echoes through Chidibiere\u2019s head. He tries to imagine an actual bed, a roof without holes, and walls bearing no cracks through which lizards visit.\n\nScreeching tyres and the loud sound of metal crashing into metal from a nearby accident break his trance. But thoughts of a comfortable home return. Maybe one with chairs and a dining set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he understands the difference between needs and wants, and what matters most is a full stomach.\n\nHome. Anything but a worn, bare mattress on the cemented floor and 4 a.m. baths taken with sand beneath his feet.\n\nOut of the frying pan into the fire would be a fitting title if his life were a movie or a book.\n\nAfter losing his father to death\u2019s cold hands, he had to watch his mother eke out a living every day as she tried to feed her children and pay an elephant-sized rent for an ant-sized space.\n\nHow is meaning defined in a state of such deep despair? Hope seems like a long-lost friend, in its place, an empty stomach and dreams of a happy life. One in which he didn\u2019t have to attend school two out of five days due to outstanding fees.\n\nIt\u2019s August 2021, and Chidiebere is in a better place. Now 17 years old and armed with mastery in three programming languages, Python and Java included, he is preparing for the forthcoming West African Examination Council (WAEC) exams, looking to get into the university, and pursuing a long-coveted career in football. Big dreams, but doable.\n\nThings seem to be looking up. But don\u2019t fairy-god mothers appear only in Cinderella-esque tales? Well, it turns out that a certain charity organisation has taken to transforming the lives of children on the streets of Nigeria using an underlying triad mission of care, empowerment, and education.\n\nIn 2012, Abimbola Ojenike, a litigation and transactional lawyer practising in his legal firm as at the time, couldn\u2019t help but notice that a large number of children roamed the streets during school hours. He identified this as a big problem and got Kemi Oluboba, Co-founder and Ikem Isiekwena, Co-founder, aboard on a mission to solve this challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe did checks about them and realised that most of them were actually homeless. We saw this as a challenge and decided to solve a problem around education for people who have no home at all, and also to be able to empower and provide care to them, because education cannot be sustainable if people have no stable home at all,\u201d Ojenike told Techpoint Africa.\n\nGlobally, there is a staggering number of out-of-school children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) counts 258 million children, and as of 2020, 65,165, 951 of this figure lived in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@trevcole?\n\nReasons like forceful home evictions, child neglect, and chief of all, poverty account for those numbers.\n\nMany of Africa\u2019s population live in slums, with most homes headed by unemployed single mothers. In most cases, children in these situations are abandoned and take to the streets to find food and a sense of belonging.\n\nAt the point of founding, The Destiny Trust Children Foundation kicked off operation as a centre for providing shelter and rehabilitation to homeless children while partnering with schools to help the children get access to education.\n\n\u201cOur programs are in three aspects. One is care: we recruit these kids into our program, take them off the streets, and keep them in our home outlets with a branch in most of the cities we\u2019re in.\n\n\u201cThey are then placed in some of the schools we partner with. And in a playful manner, they are introduced to tech and artistic skills, which is so important, because the idea is to equip them with skills that will empower them beyond the foundation. Something people can pay them for later on.\u201d\n\nSo far, the foundation has interacted with up to 15,000 children through different programmes.\n\n\u201cFor some of them, it\u2019s a one-off kind of interaction, like food drives. For others, it\u2019s school enrollment, people that we put in school. Because every year, we take hundreds of children to school. Like in 2020, it was about 500. This year, we\u2019re looking at a thousand already. We also have people benefitting from school projects we have done, and some from our coding tutors, as some of them go out to teach in schools.\u201d\n\nKids\u2019 innovation Hub and STEM bootcamps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, the foundation opened a Kids Innovation Hub to equip children with tech skills.\n\nThe process involves selecting children from charity homes, public schools, and low-income private schools; equipping them with digital skills by organising bootcamps; employing coders for teaching; occasionally inviting mentors to meet with the kids on demo days; and assess the teachers\u2019 methodologies.\n\nOjenike reveals that the hub also allows the children to embrace other creative skills beyond coding, emphasising that freedom of expression and exploration is encouraged.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show them their right to access the art and technology space. We encourage them to explore different activities beyond coding. Upon close monitoring, we discover their flairs and help them focus on their interests, be it design, drawing or digital illustrations.\u201d\n\nSince its launch, 445 children aged 6-18 have been introduced to tech. The fourth edition of the Kids\u2019 Innovation Hub STEM bootcamp was held from August 7 to August 21, 2021, in partnership with IngressiveForGood, a not-for-profit platform that trains youths in Africa with tech talents and connects them with jobs.\n\nDuring the bootcamp, there was a demo day, which saw attendance from a few key players in the African tech scene to mentor and encourage the children.\n\nConsidering the weight of what it takes to run a charity organisation, the foundation has a community of tech and non-tech volunteers, including coders, carers, teachers, cooks, social media managers, and administrators.\n\nTo volunteer, interested persons can send an application to destinytrust@org, stating the role they want to function in.\n\nCurrently located in Ibadan, and Igbo-Ora, Oyo State, and Lagos, Ojenike shares that each city comes with its unique problems which fit under their care, education and empowerment solution structure.\n\n\u201cSo, Lagos is where we started from. It\u2019s cosmopolitan, and you see all kinds of people here. The street children escaping parts of the country where insurgency is a real challenge end up in Lagos, and this is where we have a good number of homeless people. So our focus here is providing food, shelter and care, alongside education.\n\n\u201cAnd when you go on the streets, you also meet kids from the Southwest, who moved to Lagos from Ibadan, owing to promises of a better life. This is one of the reasons we opened a centre in Ibadan. In Igbo-Ora, almost anyone has a family compound to live in, so our focus there is education and empowerment.\u201d\n\nSustaining a charity foundation in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is the case with most charity organisations, funding is quite a challenge. Destiny Trust Children Foundation gets her funding from goodwill and volunteers. Ojenike shares that contributions from volunteers and their families make up most of their source of income.\n\n\u201cOur volunteers\u2019 community is actually really amazing. A very significant percentage of our income comes from our own members. At the time we did our midyear impact report, volunteers and their family members contributed 70% of what was spent from January to June.\u201d\n\nHe also adds that, for external funding, the foundation isn\u2019t running on any grants at the moment. The latest was received in 2019 due to a partnership with an organisation in Luxembourg to conduct a literacy program in Africa. Most of the time, after they applied for grants, their applications were rejected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied for grants and have been rejected a number of times. But we are not giving up. We are still trying. We know that the right opportunities will come. We\u2019ve learnt from things we didn\u2019t do right from previous applications, and we are trying to get a good sense of what the grants reviewers are looking out for, also looking out for organisations where our cause will be better appreciated.\u201d\n\nSome members of the foundation\u2019s board and management team include Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Vice-president of Nigeria; Mrs Ngozi Ken-Udochukwu, Lawyer and child development advocate; Mrs Foluke Irukera, early childhood education consultant; and Ol\u00fawat\u00f3s\u00ecn Olaseinde, Co-founder and CEO of MoneyAfrica, a subscription-based financial edtech platform,\n\nOlaseinde shares a bit of her journey with the foundation with Techpoint Africa. She heard about the foundation via Twitter and immediately applied to volunteer because the vision aligned with her passion for education, especially for underprivileged children.\n\n\u201cI reached out via a DM to schedule a visit to their home. There was so much warmth in the place. The children were joyful and relaxed. I could feel it. I joined immediately. Six months later, I joined the partnership team. It\u2019s a win-win for the children and the economy that we play a long term game by getting them education and developmental skills.\u201d\n\nGoing forward; plans for the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe need for creating access to education and skill acquisition for Africa\u2019s over 60 million out-of-school children and adolescents is not only vital but pressing. Abandoned and uneducated, these children are susceptible to being used as accomplices for several societal menaces due to lack of proper information and neglect.\n\nCommenting on this, a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes(PDF) reveals, \u201cThroughout the world, teenaged and young adult males commit most of the crime, and Africa\u2019s youthful population (43% under the age of 15) means that a greater part of the society falls into this pool of potential offenders. Many of these young people are not enrolled in educational programmes and cannot find employment.\u201d\n\nThis follows Ojenike\u2019s train of thought, and he believes that an expansion to more cities is not only necessary but urgent.\n\n\u201cWe want to be everywhere children need us. What we\u2019re doing now is only navigating the surface of the problem. We want to be able to replicate what we\u2019re doing in other states by setting up centres in new states for the school empowerment program. This year, we have set up two centres we are looking to strengthen and expand.\u201d\n\nThere is also a need for more teachers and computers for the Kids\u2019 Innovation Hubs in Lagos and Ibadan to foster paced and personalised learning. Ojenike also shares that the educational program is being expanded to over-aged children who have never been to school.\n\n\u201cFor somebody who is over 14 years old and has never been to school, how do you teach coding without first ensuring basic reading and writing skills? So, the plan is to open up new centres for overaged children. We are looking at the first of October to launch this special kind of school for accelerated education.\u201d\n\nAs with Chidiebere\u2019s case, the foundation has its shares of testimonies. Some of its alumni have grown after being equipped with skills to sustain themselves and make their way in the world, securing university education.\n\n\u201cSome of our kids are in the university. We have some of them in UI (University of Ibadan), Benson Idahosa University, and other places. For those who have gone through the innovation hub, we have a few in Unilag (University of Lagos), who were able to continue their own development in tech.\u201d\n\nFor Olaseinde, the best moments of being a part of the foundation are seeing the children grow up to set positive examples.\n\n\u201cThe joy of watching the children evolve. At the latest outreach, there was a girl that we re-integrated into the education system from our host community. She was at the forefront of the outreach. She has grown over the years and was a model example to the other children.\u201d\n\nThe continent is rife with challenges, but they provide room for innovation. You would agree with me that Africa is abundant with golden opportunities. And there is so much more than we can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, a Nigerian-American was recognised for her innovative work advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in voice.\n\nThe attraction came from building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages, which was innovative. As of the time she founded the startup, the market was pretty undefined and unrefined, with no known player in the space focused on native African languages.\n\nTo get an idea of how it feels to get the attention of an organisation like Women in Voice (WiV) \u2014 an international non-profit based in Seattle \u2014 and her plans for it, we had a chat, albeit briefly.\n\nI did get an idea, but I only scratched the surface. I would come to realise that what seemed like a big deal was only a bit of the life of a hard-working woman with a problem-solving attitude, willing to keep shattering glass ceilings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, Abake Adenle got to know of my interest in a broader conversation, and she gladly obliged.\n\nOn the set Monday evening, I noticed she had a relaxed look that set the tone for what was to be an exciting conversation. We kicked off as casually as it gets with small talks.\n\n\u201cWho is Abake Adenle?\u201d felt like the simplest conversation starter I could think of. And I guess I made the right call because 15 minutes into the virtual chat, I could already picture how one stage of life blended seamlessly into the next.\n\nBut was I wrong? I wish I wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively content with how my life has evolved. There have certainly been challenges, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be challenges ahead, but I try to take a stoic approach and just let it go.\u201d She paused to refer to the popular Disney sensation, Frozen, before she continued her train of thought, \u201cyou can only plan so much. I think the whole thing is to be flexible, proactive, and responsive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\nAbake could have been an academic professor \u2014 which she says she never lost the thrill for \u2014 but she chose the practical world of finance. With lots of experience in the bag, she checked out years later in pursuit of another adventure.\n\nCurrently, she is wading the waters of entrepreneurship while running a startup with a lean team. And she didn\u2019t hide how much she enjoys doing what she does.\n\nIn the world of entrepreneurship\n\n\u201cDo you miss your 9 to 5?\u201d I asked, teasing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe blurted, \u201cNo!\u201d amidst chuckles, adding comments about how much she enjoys the flexibility she now has.\n\nIf we ignore her inability to enjoy the work-life balance she craved, Abake never had a problem with investment banking \u2014 her first foray into the business world \u2014 as the commitment required could have happened in other careers.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of owning my time. I also enjoy intellectual freedom. I\u2019m working on something I want to work on,\u201d with an emphasis on the later \u2018I\u2019, \u201cnot because I\u2019ve been told to work on it, but because I actually enjoy working on it. This is something I value.\u201d\n\nFor her, being an entrepreneur is more fluid as it allows her to consider other things and probably pivot. In comparison, with investment banking where she had a core thing to focus on.\n\nGrowing up like the average Jane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI think I probably belong to the group of Nigerians that have lived in lots of different places but always having Nigeria as their anchor.\u201d\n\nAbake was born in the US, but she lived her first six years in Ibadan and partly Lagos, Nigeria, before going back. At age 11, she came back to the Motherland for her secondary school studies.\n\nBy 16, she returned to the US, where she studied Electrical Engineering for her undergraduate studies at Morgan State University, Maryland, before going for a PhD programme in the United Kingdom.\n\nBecause Abake enjoys studying, and she felt her knowledge of hardware was not as much as she would like, she decided to do a PhD degree in Signal Processing with a focus on Bayesian Inference from Cambridge University, graduating with good grades.\n\nAt that time, there was an attraction towards the finance industry, so she transitioned from engineering to work at Morgan Stanley, a global investment bank. There, she worked as a quantitative strategist.\n\n\u201cMy role was to design and develop trading strategies for institutional investors. And I did that for about eight years.\u201d\n\nI joked about guessing why she ditched engineering as an opportunity to work with companies that hold a lot of capital. In her role, she found ways to help large companies into insurance, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset management and implement investment ideas.\n\nShe agreed her time in investment banking helped hone her expertise in business while acquiring commercial skills and ideas, something she wouldn\u2019t have learned in academia.\n\nReferring to her parents\u2019 massive involvement in her life, Abake says her informed foundation continues to play an essential role in the values she holds dear.\n\n\u201cThey set a very good example for us in terms of being hardworking, being open-minded, and not being afraid to pursue new opportunities, new ideas and adventures.\u201d\n\nAs the last of four children, she mainly owes her love for reading and mathematics to her mum, who made her and her siblings study more while encouraging a reading culture.\n\nAlthough Abake said that she had never wanted to go into academia, she seemed to me more like a teacher.\n\nReminding her after she carefully delineated the concept of Signal Processing and Bayesian Inference and its applicability in investment banking and everyday life, she eventually agreed with me.\n\n\u201cA lot of the work I was doing was going with salespeople to meet with, like, the Chief Investment Officer of this sovereign wealth fund or the head of that asset management fund. These are people who were very senior, who may not be experts at math. So I quickly had to learn that you can\u2019t spend all your time describing things in ways that nobody understands what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nJourney into the startup scene\n\nDuring Abake\u2019s eight years at Morgan Stanley, she developed a mobile app for learning Yoruba, the Speak Yoruba App. It was never part of her plans, but she was inspired after seeing her niece and nephew use an app for learning English alphabets.\n\n\u201cAnd it ended up doing well in the app store.\u201d That was both surprising and gratifying, but she couldn\u2019t do more due to her schedule.\n\n\u201cI received lots of requests from people asking me to make a version of the app for the African language that they spoke, which was nice and was something I thought I could go into. But I had a job where I was working from 8 am to 11 pm, and it wasn\u2019t realistic to take on at that time.\u201d\n\nI wondered where the mind to build stuff randomly came from, and Abake hinted that aside from how she\u2019s weirdly drawn to studying and solving problems, she enjoyed making houses out of books as a young child.\n\nIn addition to that, a particular course during her undergraduate studies \u2014 where they were challenged to build something from an idea \u2014 was a trigger.\n\nSoon, the time came when Abake finally decided to find a new challenge. Although she had several ideas, she settled with running a business of her own. At that point, she had the opportunity to pitch to Innovate UK for a grant, so she decided to revive the Yoruba-learning app, which is now no longer available on the app store.\n\n\u201cThis was probably like four years on from when I\u2019d launched the app. And I didn\u2019t think the app itself was substantial enough of an idea to pitch for a grant. Before then, I\u2019d be thinking about adding features that would require voice recognition and speech synthesis.\u201d\n\nGiven how untapped speech technology for the African languages market was as of 2017, there were uncertainties. In September 2017, she got the Innovate UK grant.\n\nWhat\u2019s the plan for the grant?\n\n\u201cIt was for me to develop voice recognition and speech synthesis along with an implementation of a product with two African languages. So, I developed a Beta One for Yoruba and Swahili.\n\n\u201cWe developed a male Swahili voice, and three female Yoruba voices, one of which was based on my voice speaking Yoruba. Also, we developed our core voice recognition model along with a couple of variants that were content-specific voice recognition models for Yoruba and Swahili.\u201d\n\nShe confirmed her fluency in Yoruba didn\u2019t only come from her stay in Nigeria as her parents played their part.\n\nAll that went on for a year. In the meantime, she still consulted in the finance space while looking for funding, but VCs weren\u2019t forthcoming given the undefined nature of the African speech recognition market.\n\nOn the other hand, having hands-on experience in the investment space, she was cautious of investment proposals that would take away most of her control in the business.\n\nBootstrapping for another six months, she went with a bigger proposal to Innovate UK, where the business got up to $500,000 in seed fund. With that, they could expand the beta product offering from a language perspective and use it to build data resources.\n\n\u201cAs of now, even though we\u2019re still in private beta, we still have the broadest native African language coverage.\u201d\n\nCompared to when she started, she\u2019s confident in the attention the market now gets. And global companies are also looking to partner, giving it prospects for commercial viability.\n\nOf wild interests and everything in between\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle. Source: Supplied\n\nFor Abake, it has not only been investment banking, engineering, and entrepreneurship.\n\nInterestingly, she didn\u2019t always have an idea of a career to pursue. At some point, she considered management consulting because a family friend was excelling at it.\n\nThen at another time, medicine. But, she changed her mind after an opportunity to scrub in during a surgery at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine during an undergraduate internship.\n\nAbake believes investment banking was better suited to her background and interests. But she\u2019s quick to add that despite having good grades and being hardworking, she has always been privileged to find herself in favourable situations. But in it all, she\u2019s content.\n\nAbake cannot deny that she had exciting moments at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cThere was a period where I came up with a strategy which worked across multiple environments. And it was ultimately adopted by a very large European asset manager who was somewhat difficult to deal with. I ended up developing a very good relationship with him and his team.\u201d\n\nThis is one of her high points, building something unique, innovative, delivering value, and commercially viable.\n\nBut it was more than that.\n\nAbake also experienced racism even though she has always worked in the UK.\n\nHere\u2019s a funny story: Even though she occupied a role very few black women find themselves in, sometimes, she was thought to be a secretary. But she wasn\u2019t deterred by that.\n\n\u201cI think that even though it\u2019s important to acknowledge these things, it is also important not to dwell too much on them. Otherwise, you become burdened with examining misogyny and racism, rather than being effective and productive.\u201d\n\nAs an entrepreneur, she\u2019s had to deal with trying to enter mutually beneficial partnerships and getting the right set of people to key into her goals, challenges startups often face at any face of the business life cycle.\n\nAsides from reading, Abake enjoys cooking, travelling, and spending time with friends and family.

          "title": "Will eNaira become a cheaper, faster option for remittances?",
          "text": "The website for eNaira, Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), went live on Monday, almost a week ahead of its anticipated launch on October 1.\n\nThe apex bank said on the new website that the eNaira, which provides a unique form of money denominated in naira, would help ease frictions Nigerians experience in remittance transactions.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira provides a secure and cheaper diaspora remittance option and an increase in the speed of such transactions,\u201d the CBN said.\n\nRemittance remains one of the major sources of foreign exchange for Nigeria. A report from Agusto Consulting on diaspora remittance shows that Nigeria has over $21 billion annually in inflows, making it the second-largest recipient of remittance on the continent, only after Egypt. Diaspora remittance also represents the second-largest source of foreign exchange inflow into the country, second only to crude oil earnings.\n\nIn recent times, the country experienced revenue sources declining significantly. In 2019, the figures dipped by 2 percent to $23.8 billion, while in 2020, a double-digit drop of 27.7 percent was recorded as diaspora remittances fell to $17.2 billion driven by the COVID-19 pandemic on the incomes of Nigerians living abroad.\n\nRead also: Nigerian banks increasingly tap CBN for cash as liquidity shrinks\n\nWorried by the decline, the CBN introduced a raft of policies to boost remittances. One of the policies allowed beneficiaries of diaspora remittance to be paid in foreign currency. The apex bank also announced the Naira4dollar scheme in the second quarter of 2021, which pays diaspora Nigerians N5 rebate for every $1 or remittance sent through licenced International Monetary Transfer Operators (IMTOs).\n\nThe country attracted 24 percent fewer diaspora remittances in the first quarter of 2021 than in the previous year. Data from the CBN\u2019s balance of payment (BOP), foreign financial flows from Nigerian families abroad into the country fell to $4.2 billion in that period, from $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nWhy is diaspora remittance dropping?\n\nThe 27.7 percent decline in 2020 was so significant that the World Bank said in its remittance report that it was the primary reason for the entire sub-Saharan Africa region. That decline accounted for over 40 percent of remittance flows to the region.\n\nAccording to the global financial institutions, the decline was largely due to the cost of remittance.\n\n\u201cSub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region to send money to where sending $200 costs an average of 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nAlthough the CBN says the eNaira provides a cheaper option for diaspora remittances, it does not say how this will become possible.",

          "text": "The 13th edition of the BusinessDay CEO Forum, coming up tomorrow (September 30), will feature a keynote address by Michael Raynor, bestselling author and expert on strategy and innovation.\n\nRaynor is the author of management bestsellers like The Strategy Paradox: Why Committing to Success Leads to Failure (And What to do About It), The Innovator\u2019s Manifesto: Deliberate Disruption for Transformational Growth, and The Three Rules: How Exceptional Companies Think.\n\nAt the end of his presentation, he will join a fireside chat with CEOs to discuss how his ideas square up with the Nigerian business reality.\n\nThe BusinessDay CEO Forum presents a unique opportunity for business leaders to sharpen the strategic assumptions, future plans, tactical priorities, and execution prowess with CEOs of leading companies and ranking thought leaders.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition under the theme, \u2018Reboot: Regaining Strategic Flexibility in the Age of Uncertainty\u2019 will address two main issues.\n\nFirstly, how CEOs can build strategic flexibility into their business planning so that no matter how future events turn out, which is increasingly the case in a world characterised by uncertainty, the cost of remedying bad guesses is minimal.\n\nRead Also: Jean-Michel Paul to deliver guest address at BusinessDay CEO Forum\n\nInsight on how CEOs should read and respond to growing calls for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), post-profit corporate purpose, and environmental and social activism is the second issue the forum plans to address.\n\nWhile BusinessDay has hosted the CEO Forum every year since 2009, this year\u2019s edition is a must-attend for decision-makers in Nigeria\u2019s private sector to dissect key trends, best practices and successful business models. The CEO Forum provides the platform for debate around the prevailing challenges they confront in running their organisations.\n\nWith a reputation for helping companies escape the whims of chance, which can upend the best-executed strategy, Raynor\u2019s presentation at the CEO event promises to be useful for business leaders.\n\nRaynor, who was described by the Financial Times as \u201cone of the most articulate and interesting thought leaders in innovation today,\u201d brings a unique data-driven approach to the development and implementation of cutting-edge concepts.\n\nWriting in the Harvard Business Review, he observed, \u201cMuch of the strategy and management advice that business leaders turn to is unreliable or impractical. That\u2019s because those who would guide us underestimate the power of chance.\u201d\n\nAfter performing a statistical analysis of more than 25,000 companies over more than 40 years, he concluded that there were just three rules companies need to abide by to excel.\n\nFirst, they must strive to offer better products and services before price. Those who compete on differentiators rather than price stand a better chance of standing out and succeeding in the long term.\n\nSecond, they need to put revenues above cost. In other words, they must prioritise increasing revenue over reducing costs.\n\nFinally, there are no other rules so companies must embrace disrupting their business models and standard practices to achieve the first and second principles.\n\nAttendees at the CEO Forum will leave empowered with the knowledge to implement these in their organisations.\n\nJean-Michel Paul, author of The Economics of Discontent: From Failing Elites to The Rise of Populism will also deliver the guest address at this edition.\n\nPaul, the founder/chief executive of Acheron Capital, a London-based hedge fund, and faculty member at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, is expected to ride on his analysis that shows how the social contract that has underpinned growth and political stability in the Western world since World War II, has broken down to impact CEOs, boards, economists, elected representatives, and policy-makers for interpreting recent unrests like the Zuma riots in South Africa, EndSars in Nigeria, secessionist agitations, and class-driven social tensions in Nigeria.\n\nAn acute scarcity of jobs and deepening poverty have fuelled social discontent that has found voice in protests in Nigeria and South Africa, whereby protests against police brutality and President Jacob Zuma\u2019s arrest turned opportunity for protesters to loot private stores.\n\nThe trend of rising unemployment and poverty does little favours for Nigeria and South Africa in their bid to boost consumer spending, attract investment and grow the economy.\n\nWith three-panel sessions titled- \u2018Changing business for a changing world,\u2019 \u2018New imperatives for corporate strategy\u2019 and \u2018Our people, our future\u2019 the forum will have other speakers and panellists that will share lessons on how business leaders can regain the strategic initiative when bogged down by past choices, and radically new realities.\n\nSome of the speakers include Adun Okupe, lecturer, Lagos Business School, Pan-Atlantic University; Akintoye Akindele, chairman/CEO, Platform Capital Group; Bolanle Asumah, director of People, Africa, McKinsey & Company; Chidi Okoro, founder, Drugs and Medicaments Nig.; Elohor Aiboni,MD, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); Ije Jidenma, managing partner, IRC Global Executive Search Partners, Nigeria; Ireti Samuel-Ogbu, CEO & Citi country officer for Nigeria/Ghana; Karl Toriola, CEO, MTN Nigeria, and Kunle Oyelana, managing director, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria (GSK).\n\nOthers are Mustapha Njie, group managing director, TAF Africa Global; Oluwole Oshin, group managing director, Custodian Investment plc; Patrick McMichael, group managing director, Eat\u2018N\u2019Go; Peju Adebajo, advisory board member, Lagos Business School, Rolake Rosiji, CEO, Jobberman Nigeria; Sonnie Ayere, group managing director/CEO at DLM Capital Group; Steve Osho, co-managing partner, Comercio Partners/CEO, Comercio Partners Capital.",

          "title": "N75bn licence fee, frequency shortage, threaten 5G rollout in Nigeria",
          "text": "Nigeria will struggle to launch a fifth-generation (5G) network in 2022 due to the high cost of licence fee and the unavailability of sufficient frequencies to power commercial deployment of the technology, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAt a meeting with stakeholders this month, Umar Garba Danbatta, the executive vice-chairman of the Nigerian Telecommunications Commission (NCC), informed operators that the 5G operating licence would cost them between N75 billion and N100 billion for the 10-year licence.\n\nBusinessDay understands that the NCC has not yet made the fee official but is making considerations in view of the high cost of the spectrum for the technology.\n\nRead also: The internet, free speech and responsibility (1)\n\n\u201cAt N75 billion, the implication is that operators would have to include N7.5 billion in their annual budgets every year for the next 10 years to settle the licence fee,\u201d says Olusola Teniola, former president of Association of Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON).\n\nAccording to Teniola, the price tag would benefit big operators and foreign networks coming into Nigeria.\n\nThe 5G launch will also struggle due to the shortage of adequate frequencies in the relevant band for 5G, and at the last check, Nigeria had just 200G of available bandwidth and it will require 100G for each licence for the launch of 5G. So, the NCC will need between 400-500GHz.\n\nThe 5G spectrum refers to the radio frequencies that carry data from user equipment to cellular base stations to the data\u2019s endpoint. The 5G frequency bands for 5G networks come in two sets. Frequency range 1 (FR1) is from 450MHz to 6GHz, which includes the LTE frequency range. Frequency range 2 (FR2) is from 24.25GHz to 52.6GHz. The sub-6GHz range is the name for FR1 and the mmWave spectrum is the name for FR2.\n\nIn May 2021, the NCC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU)with Nigerian Communication Satellite (NigComSat) Limited to facilitate the release of a contiguous bandwidth in one of the most suitable frequency spectrum bands for early deployment of 5G in Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the signing of the MoU, the two government agencies discussed on how to relocate the NG-1R satellite of NigComSat to the standard C-band 300MHz (3.5GHz-3.9GHz) portion of the band, which is considered more suitable in terms of satellite service offering because of the advantage of cheaper terminal devices for end-user. Such relocation leaves the non-standard C-band 400MHz (3.5GHz-3.9GHz) portion of the band for 5G use while the cost of relocating the NG-1R will then be offset from the proceeds of the auction of the 5G spectrum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that NCC and NigComSat have yet to agree on the way forward. NCC is said to be currently negotiating with NigComSat to release some frequencies to it but it is unclear how progressed this negotiation is, sources say. The commission has already secured the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which is expected to speed up the negotiation with NigComSat.\n\nWhile the prolonged negotiation constitutes a delay in the commencement of the spectrum auction, stakeholders say it is needed to properly align the expectations of the agencies and other parties involved.\n\nSome stakeholders also note that in the past these frequencies were given out without proper value assessment. While many other countries have for a while been realigning their frequency requirement or needs and have been retrieving frequencies from some areas and reallocating to other areas, Nigeria, BusinessDay learns, has yet to get its acts together.\n\nHowever, this frequency shortage is not a particularly Nigerian problem. The shortage of frequencies is partly why they are also very expensive around the world.\n\nBeyond scarcity, industry players are divided on whether the N75 billion price level for the licence is too high.\n\n\u201cThe operators that want to offer 5G services will include this cost in their business plan,\u201d Ike Nnamani, president of ATCON, told BusinessDay, noting, \u201cAs long as the financial model makes business sense they will go for the 5G licence. If it does not make business sense they will not bid or acquire the spectrum. So, the final decision on this will be based on the business plan each operator wants to operate.\u201d\n\nHis view aligns with some industry players who say the licence reserve fee is appropriate in this circumstance.\n\nAccording to Teniola, the price could discourage small network operators in Nigeria from deploying 5G technology. The smaller network operators have yet to recover their expenses on spectrum for older generations.\n\nNigeria is still struggling to get 4G around the country. 3G and 4G coverage in Nigeria generally are still very low. For example, 3G coverage as of 2020 was at 49.4 million, a decline compared with 50.4 million recorded in 2019. 4G coverage in Nigeria is at 36.5 million in 2020 from 21.7 million reported in 2019.\n\nThe National Broadband Plan 2020 set an ambitious target for 3G coverage to at least 80 percent of the population by 2025. Less than four years to the timeline, coverage stands at about 50 percent while 4G is at 37 percent coverage.\n\nAdebayo Gbenga, president, Association of Licensed Telecom Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), who is yet to see the figures, told BusinessDay that if the plan becomes reality, it could have implications for operators in the sector.\n\nTwo telecom licence holders, MTN and Airtel are projected to be able to afford N75 billion or consider it an investment worthwhile. There is also the attraction for those listed firms or those with international links who may see not taking the 5G licence as a failure. As technology evolves, companies cut operational costs by adopting the latest technology.",

          "text": "A non-governmental organisation, ActionAid Nigeria, has asked the federal government to adopt fiscal federalism in order to accelerate the development of the country.\n\nThe group stated this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja after the 44th meeting of its Board of Trustees and General Assembly held virtually to review the state of the nation last Saturday.\n\nThe statement was signed by its convener, Yusuf Ogwuezebe.\n\nActionAid Nigeria is a national non-governmental, non-partisan, non-religious, civil society organisation, and an affiliate member of the ActionAid International Federation with presence in 45 countries.\n\nIt works in solidarity with people living in poverty and exclusion to achieve social justice, gender equality and poverty eradication towards achieving a just, equitable and sustainable world in which every person enjoys the right to a life of dignity, freedom from poverty and all forms of oppression.\n\nThe group said it reviewed developments in government, politics, the economy, and security during the last quarter, particularly as it affects vulnerable groups, including women, children, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), and youth and decided to share its views and recommendations on the way forward.\n\nThe group observed that public fiscal deficit, financed mostly by domestic and foreign borrowings, widened with high debt service payments, estimated at more than half of federally collected revenues, pose a major fiscal risk to Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nIt said the rising public debt, unemployment, inflation, and high cost of living require the immediate embracing of fiscal federalism in absolute terms.\n\n\u201cRising public debt, unemployment, inflation, and high cost of living require the immediate embracing of fiscal federalism in absolute terms. This will enable the country to break the vicious cycle of poverty. It will eliminate the wholesale dependence on oil which makes Nigeria a monolithic economy,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cAdopting the principles of fiscal federalism will be a practical approach to solving the challenges governments at all levels face today, such as the generation and equitable distribution of income, efficient and effective allocation of resources, and economic stability. Revenue drive and allocation of resources can be done effectively by states and local governments with strong measures to curtail graft and corruption.\u201d\n\nActionAid noted that Nigeria is faced with an unprecedented wave of different but overlapping security crises \u2013 from kidnapping to extremist insurgencies, adding that almost every corner of the country has been hit by violence and crime.\n\nIt said the growing insecurity has been closely linked to the high rate of poverty in the country.\n\nOn the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), the group noted that doctors across the country have embarked on strike for the fourth time since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with some of them complaining they are owed salaries for several months.\n\nIt said many Nigerian media outlets are reporting that patients \u2013 some with COVID-19 symptoms \u2013 are being turned away at short-staffed hospitals.\n\nThe group also observed that the ongoing review of the 1999 constitution by the National Assembly offers the opportunity for Nigerians to shape the document with the goal that it reflects the desires and aspirations of the citizens.\n\nIt stated that some of the provisions to be considered vital for the uplifting of the status of citizens include Socio-Economic and Cultural Rights as contained in Chapter 2 of the constitution, issues of Gender Equality and a thorough reform of the Nigeria Police.\n\nIt also noted that the Twitter ban by the federal government last June has had severe economic costs, adding that it is a step backwards for civic engagements and threatens the civic space which has continued to shrink in recent years.\n\nApart from calling for fiscal federalism, ActionAid asked the government to renew the nation\u2019s partnership with neigbouring countries to enhance intelligence exchange and information sharing that would help in quelling insurgency and other sundry crimes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019Cracking the nation\u2019s current security challenges also requires increasing the manpower and welfare of all security agencies and equipping them with modern combat equipment, skills, and training,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe government must renew our partnership with neighboring countries to enhance intelligence exchange and information sharing that would help in quelling the insurgency and other sundry crimes.\n\n\u201cThe state-of-the-art combat Tucano and Alpha jets newly acquired must be deployed immediately to help in further neutralizing the criminal elements with precision and bring the protracted insurgency to an end. Contemporary hi-tech security management networking as adopted by advanced countries of the world should be embraced.\u201d\n\nThe group called on the federal and state governments to explore different models to improve the work environment for medical practitioners.\n\nIt said health insurance must be made mandatory with sound mechanisms to prevent corruption for universal health care coverage.\n\n\u201cGovernment must ensure that there are more funds to upgrade health care infrastructure, clinical equipment and therefore improve the welfare and work climate of medical practitioners to induce job satisfaction,\u201d it stated.\n\nOn constitution review, ActionAid recommended that the non-justiciability of the provisions of chapter 2 of the 1999 constitution should be reviewed and amended by removing the non-justiciable character and make them enforceable in line with international treaties which have been domesticated in Nigeria.\n\nIt said there is an urgent need to amend the constitution to allow for states to set up their various police outfits by taking the police off the exclusive legislative list and including the same in the concurrent list.\n\nIt called on the federal government to rescind its decision on the Twitter ban, saying \u201cit has had a huge socio-economic impact not only on the lives of emerging young entrepreneurs who depend on the social media for their livelihood, but it is also a counterproductive move for a nation seeking to create more jobs and reduce poverty as part of its post COVID-19 recovery strategy.\u201d\n\nIt added that the ban raises human rights and reputational concerns about the leadership of the country.\n\nActionAid also announced the election of new members of its Board.\n\nAccording to the statement, the new board will be chaired by Jummai Umar-Ajijola with Imoni Amarere as vice chairman and James Milaham as treasurer.",

          "text": "A child forensic interview expert, Anike Ajayi-Kayode has told an Ikeja Special Offences Court how Nollywood actor Olanrewaju James (Baba Ijesha) allegedly groomed and defiled a minor (name withheld).\n\nAjayi-Kayode, executive director of the Cece Yara Foundation, a non-governmental organisation founded to prevent child sexual abuse and provide emergency intervention for children, told the court that she was a certified child forensic interview specialist and had participated in over 25 child forensic interviews.\n\nLed in evidence by Olayinka Adeyemi, Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Ms Ajayi-Kayode pointed out that the alleged victim was relaxed, cooperative, and could recall events when she was interviewed.\n\n\u201cThe clinal presentation of child sexual abuse was quite evident. The perpetuator engaged the child in sexual activity when she was seven years old on two occasions. On April 19, 2021, he sexually harassed her, touching her body. He told her: \u2018I touched you some years back. You are so grown, so developed. Do you have a boyfriend? We have some unfinished business\u2019,\u201d said the forensic expert. \u201cThese are the clinical presentations of child sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cThese are the dynamics of child sexual abuse and the modus operandi of perpetuators \u2013 inculcation of secrecy, intimidation, threat or coercion.\u201d\n\nThe expert further noted that child sexual abuse involved only the victim and the perpetrator, adding that a minor might not comprehend the magnitude of the offence because of being vulnerable, NAN reported.\n\nAjayi-Kayode added that after the interview, she drafted a forensic interview report. A copy was presented to the court by the prosecution as evidence. It was marked as Exhibit G.\n\nThe witness also stated that the forensic interview was digitally recorded. Flash drives containing the digital forensic interview of the minor were also tendered in evidence by the prosecution and were marked Exhibits H and H1.\n\n\u201cMy conclusion is that she narrated the whole truth. She was tenacious, she was bold and relaxed,\u201d the expert said.\n\nAt the start of proceedings, the defence had sought an adjournment due to the absence of lead counsel Babatunde Ogala (SAN) and Dada Awosika (SAN).\n\nA member of the defence team, N.A. Adeyemi said Mr Ogala, in a letter dated September 27, had asked for an adjournment of proceedings because he would be unavoidably absent.\n\nHowever, the DPP opposed the request for an adjournment.\n\nConsequently, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo ordered the trial proceed with the third prosecution witness (Ms Ajayi-Kayode) giving evidence.\n\nThe judge adjourned the case until October 20 for cross-examination of the witness.\n\nActress and comedienne Damilola Adekoya (alias Princess), the foster mother of the minor, and Nollywood actress Iyabo Ojo were present in court during Tuesday\u2019s proceedings.\n\nThe embattled actor faces a six-count charge of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nThe alleged offences contravene sections 135, 259, 262, 263, and 262 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.",

What divides us are those who, for their own nefarious ends, seek to use them to prise us apart.\n\nWhile President Buhari was focusing on the problems plaguing the nation and in some instances asking for international support to deal with such, a coalition of groups protested outside the UN building.\n\nThis happens with all countries- the United States, UK, India, Iran, China, Egypt- about everyone and about every conceivable issue but most especially climate change, gender and animal rights among others.\n\nThere are some from the so-called \u201cYoruba nation\u201d group and the so-called \u201cIndigenous People of Biafra\u201d (IPOB) terrorist group who worked together to protest outside the United Nations building in New York.\n\nThey sought to claim astonishingly that, somehow, they have earned rights through violence, murder of law enforcement agents and the innocent, and extortion to run their own affairs.\n\nMany Nigerians at home were disconcerted by the tribal bullying of government officials as they moved to carry out their diligent work between the Nigerian Mission in New York and the UN building, a walkable distance of less than 400 meters.\n\nProtests are allowed by all who had anything to say. Tribal bullying is uncivilised. So is any effort to strengthen insurgency in the country.\n\nThis is an extraordinary misinterpretation of the principles of the United Nations. There is no place in or before this organisation for racists, ethnic cleansers, and those who associate with them.\n\nOn the other hand, those pro-Buhari/pro-Nigeria demonstrators in immaculate green-white-green deserve to be praised for the maturity and decorum with which they carried on, ignoring crude insults and abuse from an opposition campaign inspired and conducted in accordance with rule book of the Nazi against Jews, Hutu extremists against the Rwandan Tutsi.\n\nIn Nigeria today, IPOB has created an armed terror wing, the Eastern Security Network \u2013 complete with a fascistic logo \u2013 to coerce through violence innocent Nigerians, forcing them to protest against those of other ethnicities and religious beliefs and to lockdown states and stop people from the pursuit of their legitimate aspirations.\n\nThey seek power by demonising other communities and targeting those Nigerians who speak other dialects. Any group associating with this recognised terrorist group is demonstrating there is little difference in their beliefs, or their intent.\n\nPresident Buhari came to the UN to tell the world that his government is rebuilding sustainably from the COVID-19 pandemic, responding to the needs of the planet, respecting the rights of the people and supporting the UN; that Nigeria is guaranteeing fundamental human rights and tackling climate change to achieve environmental sustainability.\n\nThe President also expressed commitment to UN programmes, in particular the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development; that the Federal Government under him has instituted a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related policies and programmes.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also gave firm assurances that Government is taking measures to organize transparent elections at all levels, fighting to provide security for all and sustainable socio-economic development.\n\nIn this context, his government is focusing on economic diversification, infrastructure development, job creation and human capital development as drivers of economic growth and stability.\n\nThere are indeed also major initiatives to promote foreign direct investment and export.\n\nGovernment, he similarly assured, is investing huge resources to facilitate the emergence of a secure, stable, viable, resilient and prosperous nation.\n\nAt the sub-regional level, President Buhari was acclaimed for leading in the fight against terrorism and the enthronement of democratic culture and practice.\n\nAt the International level, the support in the fight against global terrorism, leading the campaign against corruption, illicit financial flows and supporting assets recovery also endeared the President to his audiences.\n\nAs a good global citizen and player, President Buhari gave clear indication of the willingness on the part of Nigeria to continue championing a just world order with free trade and free movement of goods and persons, and greater regional integration based on respect, justice and fairness.\n\nSuccess in getting Nigerians into key positions in international organizations is a result of Government\u2019s vision of global peace and concord.\n\nThis is also reflected in peacekeeping roles around the world. The Nigerian Technical Aid Corps programme continues to provide technical support outreach to countries of the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific.\n\nAs the biggest country in Africa, the Government takes seriously its leadership role on the continent and strives to promote African prosperity.\n\nIn addition to all these, President Buhari promised to take steps towards providing concrete frameworks for institutionalized diaspora engagement in Nigeria.\n\nHopefully we will soon have Diaspora voting in elections in Nigeria.\n\nOn a parting note, Nigeria, the President emphasized, will always remain true to the values and principles of the United Nations.

          "text": "Roger Hunt, a member of England\u2019s 1966 World Cup winning squad and Liverpool\u2019s second-highest goalscorer ever, has died at the age of 83.\n\nHunt was central figure in Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s England squad that delivered the nation\u2019s first and only World Cup win in \u201966, playing in attack alongside Sir Geoff Hurst. He played in all six games for England in the tournament and scored three goals.\n\nHunt was overlooked for a knighthood, prompting Liverpool fans to affectionately coin the nickname \u2018Sir Roger\u2019. Hunt received an MBE in 2000.\n\nHunt, who was born in Glazebury in Lancashire in 1938, scored 285 goals in 492 matches for Liverpool, with his debut coming in September 1959. On the international scene, Hunt played 34 times for England and netted 18 goals.\n\nHe was key man under the guidance of legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, scoring 41 goals in 41 games in the side that won the second tier in 1961-62. His partnership in attack with Ian St John, who passed away in March, is fondly remembered in Liverpool\u2019s glittering history.\n\nHunt also enjoyed the distinction of scoring the first goal ever shown on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day highlights programme, a looping volley into the top corner during a 3-2 win over Arsenal on August 22, 1964.\n\nHe lived near Warrington with his wife Rowan, having previously been married to Patricia O\u2019Brien, with whom he had two children.\n\nIn 1965 Hunt opened the scoring when Liverpool beat Leeds 2-1 after extra-time at Wembley to win the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later, Hunt became Liverpool\u2019s leading scorer in January 1968 with a goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n\nHunt and Liverpool would also become the champions of England twice, winning the First Division in 1964 and 1966.\n\nDespite his relentless scoring record, one of the Shankly quotes that is engraved into Anfield folklore came when the Reds boss was quizzed about the forward missing chances.\n\n\u2018Yes Roger Hunt misses a few, but he gets in the right place to miss them,\u2019 Shankly said.\n\nHunt recalled his fondness of Shankly in an interview with the Liverpool Echo in 2020.\n\nThe death of Roger Hunt at the age of 83 leaves just three surviving members from the England team that won the World Cup in 1966.\n\nSir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and George Cohen are now the only living players from the team that famously and thrillingly defeated West Germany 4-2 after extra time at Wembley.\n\nIt remains England\u2019s only major tournament triumph, though Gareth Southgate\u2019s current crop were agonisingly close to beating Italy in the Euro 2020 final this summer.\n\nHunt started the \u201966 final in attack but his industrious performance was always likely to be overshadowed by the hat-trick scored by his strike partner Hurst.\n\nHowever, Hunt netted three times during the tournament \u2013 once in the 2-0 win over Mexico during the group stage and twice in the victory over France by the same scoreline that followed it.\n\nHe is a club legend at Liverpool, where he scored 261 goals in 416 matches and remains their all-time leading scorer in league competition.\n\nFans affectionately referred to Hunt as \u2018Sir Roger\u2019 even though he was never formally knighted. He received the MBE in 2000.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened to the rest of the England team that started the 1966 World Cup final.",

The rental expenses incurred by the Board on a yearly basis runs into several millions of naira and currently consumes a larger percentage of the Board\u2019s Overhead budget. This trend is unsustainable. Hence, my quest to build additional accommodation blocks for officers and non-commissioned officers of the Board.\n\n\u201cToday, we are going to witness the commissioning of 2 blocks of 8 x one Bedroom transit apartment for officers and 5 blocks of 16 x One self-contained room for non-commissioned officers. May I seize this opportunity to inform this gathering that the construction of some of these accommodation blocks was initiated by previous administrations at the MPB? To former Chairmen of the Board present here today, we say thank you for your vision and sacrifice in laying the foundation culminating to this commissioning ceremony\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIt also became imperative to build some support facilities in anticipation of accommodating more personnel and their families within the MPB Complex. To this end, a multipurpose minimart was constructed. The minimart comprises a mini supermarket, a Unisex saloon, a laundry shop and a relaxation area for non-commissioned officers.\n\nIt is pertinent to inform the SGOH and other distinguished guests that the minimart would be managed by the Military Pensions Board Officers Wives Association (MPBOWA) to support the Internally Generated Revenue efforts of the Association.\n\nOn payment of pension as at when due, the Chairman said that, \u201cIt is on record that since my assumption of duty in September last year, our esteemed pensioners have received their monthly pensions before the end of each month. Similarly, gratuities of all retirees who retire from Service as at July 2021 and whose retirement documents have been received at the Board have been paid. We have also ensured payments of death benefits to NOKs of deceased personnel who have been recommended by the Services and cleared as genuine NOK by the MPB NOK Committee. In addition, I am happy to inform that all retirees are presently being paid in accordance with the new pension chart wef May 21 as approved by the Federal government\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Special Guest of Honour and Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Zubairu Gambo, commended the plan to transmute to electronic verification for pensioners, noting that it will eliminate menace of pensioners.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cpermit me to state that the plan by the MPB to embark on electronic verification of military pensioners to replace the manual system is a laudable initiative. It is envisaged that the Electronic Verification of military pensioners would resolve the challenges experienced in the existing manual system.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it would lead to substantial financial savings to the Federal Government of Nigeria through progressive elimination of ghost or deceased pensioners while also eliminating the stress the senior citizens endure during manual verification exercises. The Chairman, You have our full support on this new initiative\u201d.",

For instance, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa account for about a third of the incubators and accelerators and 80 per cent of investment on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough this is not the only measure of entrepreneurship, there are reasons to explain why some countries push ahead faster with startups, ecosystem development, and commercialisation. In the cases of these four countries, their economies and populations are larger than most African countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe four countries that show the greatest investment in startups generally have higher FDI and are among the few countries able to access the limited portfolio investment that is made in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa ranked as the top three countries on the continent in terms of attracting FDI over the past decade. They also tend to dominate the African portfolio investment market.\u201d\n\nFDI is an investment or a purchase of an interest in a company by a company or an investor located outside its borders. It is thus distinguished from a foreign portfolio investment by a notion of direct control.\n\nIt\u2019s a business decision to acquire a substantial stake in a foreign business or to buy it outright in order to expand its operations to a new region.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
