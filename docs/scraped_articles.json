Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured attendees that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger.

          "text": ".\n\nNBA chairman has vested interest in the matter \u2013 Imo govt\n\nBy Chinonso Alozie\n\nOwerri- The Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Owerri branch on Saturday condemned the alleged arrest of staff of the Industrial Court of Owerri, by the Imo state government last Friday.\n\nThe NBA, made this statement to newsmen in Owerri, through the secretary, Chinedu Agu, adding that the court officials were arrested while trying to inquire the reason for a heavy police presence around the premises of a new generation bank that was sealed by an Owerri Industrial court last Thursday.\n\nNBA said it was in the process that the court officials were allegedly manhandled and arrested.\n\nIt should be recalled that last Thursday a garnishee order was given by the Owerri National Industrial court, in favour of Ex-Deputy governor of Imo state, Eze Madumere, to pay him his entitlements owed him by the Imo state government allegedly over N1.9 billion when he was Deputy governor under Governor Rochas Okorocha.\n\nBut the government under Hope Uzodimma, on Friday, obtained an order from an Owerri High court stopping any form of transferring or tempering with the government funds housing in five banks.\n\nHowever, the battle continued with the story of the arrest of Industrial court officials, according to the Owerri branch of NBA, Secretary, Agu, said: \u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association, Owerri, condemns the action of the Imo State Government in the arrest and detention of Messrs. Chima Emeka Ndukwe, Akoma Jeremiah, Ikedi Amadi and Nze Moses, senior staff of the National Industrial Court, Owerri, who the Bar gathers, were arrested and taken to an undisclosed location at about 14:30hrs Friday the 3rd day of June 2022, while on official duty.\n\n\u201cThese Staff were arrested by the legion of Policemen and savage thugs led by a Personal Assistant to the Imo State Governor, one Chinasa Nwaneri, to unseal the bank having obtained an Order from Owerri High Court (Court of coordinate jurisdiction) same as day.\n\n\u201cThe Bar further gathers that upon an order of the National Industrial Court, Owerri, on Thursday the 2nd day of June 2022, a bank was sealed for refusal to obey the judgment of the National Industrial Court, Owerri, where-in the court ordered the Bank to pay the Judgment Creditor, Prince Eze Madumere, the sum of 1.9 Billion Naira, being money owed him by Imo State Government.\n\n\u201cRather than challenge the same judgment in the Court of Appeal, the Imo State Government, in a desperate hurry, obtained a Court Order from a High Court sitting in Owerri (a court of coordinate jurisdiction) restraining Zenith Bank Plc from obeying the Judgment of the National Industrial Court, Owerri.\n\n\u201cIn a manner most brutish and saddeningly reminiscent of the Stone Age, the said Mr Nwaneri, armed with the Order of the High Court, led a legion of heavily armed policemen and fierce-looking thugs to unseal the Bank, and in the process brutalized and arrested the said Court Officials, who while on official duty, stopped by the Bank to inquire the reason for the heavy presence of security men and thugs in a Bank sealed by a subsisting Order of their court.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, register our collective disaffection with the role played by the State Government, its agents, and the Court, who assumed appellate jurisdiction over a judgment delivered by another court of coordinate jurisdiction, in a manner that ridicules the sacred tenet of court hierarchy, disparages our judicial system, mocks the principles of rule of law and scorns our noble legal profession.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Imo state government through the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said: \u201cIt is just the NBA chairman\u2019s personal opinion, I have called some lawyers they said that the statement is strange to them and that they never met anywhere to take such decision and I challenge the NBA chairman to say where NBA met to take such decision. More so, the NBA chairman is a lawyer for one of the parties to the suit. He is sounding like somebody who has a vested interest in this matter and is clashing with his position as NBA chairman in the state.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe zone 9 has denied that they did not send any police, Imo state police command has denied they did not send any police so what happened was when the police got there to find out what was happening and those people there got wind of it and they ran away and when the police got there they saw the four staff of the industrial court and arrested them to explain how they got the police they stationed there to cause trouble and they were released immediately after questioning them.\u201d",

Thus, it is critical to rapidly find and treat undiagnosed people infected with TB.\n\nGiven the high out of pocket payments in the country, the probability of catastrophic health expenditure due to TB is high.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Project Lead Anadach Group explains, Dr Bunmi Ogbodu, said TB negatively impacts private businesses through the increase in absenteeism, and reduction in man-hours amongst others as businesses which do not prioritize it. It becomes imperative to use a differentiated model approach that is inclusive of the Private Sector Strategy as part of the means to strengthen the resilient and sustainable systems for TB control.\n\nOn his part, the NHEA Director of Marketing, Communication and Strategy, Mr Moses Braimah said: \u201cWe are happy with this collaboration on Tuberculosis. It will in no small measure help to reduce the overall burden of TB in Nigeria through multiple stakeholder collaboration and we believe that having specific awards on TB would be helpful in addressing the TB situation in Nigeria, particularly encouraging participation and support from the Private Sector.\u201d\n\nNHEA is an initiative of Global Health Project and Resources, GHPR, in collaboration with Anadach Group USA.

He said he needed it to effect repairs on his okada. I gave him on the condition that he would pay back with N1,000 interest.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut he never refunded the money. He did not even call to apologise for the delay. When I eventually met him, he gave me his MP3 Bluetooth speaker to hold pending when he would pay back the loan.\n\n\n\n\u201c Hours later, he brought only N1,000 and demanded his MP3 but I refused to give him. I insisted rather, that I would only release it when he paid the balance.\n\n\n\n\u201c By midnight Sylvester and three of his friends stormed the house and started beating everyone in sight. He demanded to have his MP3 back. I had to come out from where I hid it and handed him the MP3 when it became apparent that my roommates could not bear the attack.\n\n\n\n\u201c In relation, owner of the house Alabi, who is also a Viking, was astonished because Sylvester is a member of same cult group. Accompanied by some other members, we decided to go for a reprisal attack.\n\n\n\n\u201c On our way, we saw Sylvester and some of his friends advancing towards us to continue from where they stopped. Luckily we were armed with cutlasses. We overpowered them. One of those who accompanied Sylvester, Victor, sustained machete cut in his hand. He was rushed to the hospital .\n\n\n\n\u201c We were not satisfied because Sylvester, who caused the trouble was not hurt. We mobilised again and went to the hospital in search for Sylvester only to meet Victor bleeding on the floor unattended to.\n\n\n\n\u201c Our intent was not to kill Victor but to ensure Sylvester who caused the trouble, sustained injury. Police should understand that the fight was in self-defence, he said.\n\n\n\nFor Alabi, he said he was angry with Sylvester for destroying his property when he was not the one that collected his MP3.\n\n\n\nHe said \u201c Josiah is my friend, he only came to spend the night in my house. We went to the hospital to confirm that Sylvester was really wounded, only to find Victor on the floor wounded\u201d. He however said they did not attack him at the hospital, but that news of his demise filtered in two days later and that they had to flee to evade arrest.\n\nAlso on his part, Anthony, a tailor, said his love for his younger brother made him join in the fight.\n\n\n\nAnthony who said he left his village for town, to stay away from cult activities, said \u201cI joined them when I heard my younger brother was inflicted with machete cut by Sylvester.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was the one who gave Victor the cut that landed him in the hospital. I was bitter that they dared to touch my only brother, whom I promised my mother I would protect. Unfortunately, we are facing same murder charge\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Force Public relations Officer, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi confirmed the arrest. He said efforts were still on to arrest other fleeing members.",
          "summary": "According to the mason who said he left his base in Owan, Edo state to Benin owing to pressure from his cult members, \u201c Sylvester approached me for a loan of N3,000 last year.\nWhen I eventually met him, he gave me his MP3 Bluetooth speaker to hold pending when he would pay back the loan.\nOne of those who accompanied Sylvester, Victor, sustained machete cut in his hand.\nWe mobilised again and went to the hospital in search for Sylvester only to meet Victor bleeding on the floor unattended to.\nWe went to the hospital to confirm that Sylvester was really wounded, only to find Victor on the floor wounded\u201d.",

          "text": "Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG-CARES) yesterday gave Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State a pat on the back for his administration\u2019s prudent management of public resources in the state.\n\nThe Federal Government body, saddled with the responsibility of expanding access to livelihood support and food security services, and grants for poor and vulnerable households and firms, also applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration for observing due process in the management of resources and other administrative engagements.\n\nThey lauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for enthroning prudence, probity and accountability in the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen when the Management Team of NG-CARES paid an advocacy visit to Gov. Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, which culminated in a meeting with the State Executive Council (EXCO), the National Coordinator of NG-CARES, Dr. Abdulkarim Obaje, disclosed that they were impressed with what they observed in Enugu State in terms of due process and prudent management of public resources by the state government as well as its commitment to the success of the programme in the state.\n\nDr. Obaje explained that the NG-CARES programme \u201cis a 750 million dollars credit facility from the World Bank to cushion the negative impact of COVID-19 on the poor and the vulnerable in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe added that all the 36 states of the federation are participating in the programme, disclosing that \u201ceach state is entitled to a sum of N20 million dollars at the end of the programme in June 2023\u2033.\n\nSpeaking on the outcome of their meeting with the State EXCO, NG-CARES National Coordinator disclosed that the \u201cEXCO has given wonderful approval not only for the budget implementation but has also empowered the Chairman of the State-Cares Steering Committee, the Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Mrs. Adaonah Kene-Uyanwune, to continue to paddle the boat of NG-CARES in the state without necessarily resorting to the EXCO\u201d.\n\nDescribing the EXCO approval as \u201cspectacular\u201d, Dr. Obaje pointed out that it would ensure that the activities of the body are fast-tracked, saying: \u201cWe want to commend His Excellency (Ugwuanyi) and of course the State Executive Council (EXCO) for the quality of prudence in management of public resources which we witnessed during this visit\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are very impressed to note that funds are released only after State EXCO has deliberated on it, and there is due process. The World Bank is an institution that respects due diligence in management of resources and we saw that exemplified in Enugu State.\n\n\u201cThis is going into our records as one of the best practices in management of resources. The process put in place here (Enugu) is commendable and we must put that in our records.\n\n\u201cWe are also impressed with the quality of understanding of the processes involved in NG-CARES implementation in Enugu State. And this emboldens the Chairman of the State-Cares Steering Committee, Mrs. Adaonah Kene-Uyanwune. She is here and we are really impressed with the knowledge that has been exhibited and her leadership\u201d.\n\nDr. Obaje expressed confidence that Enugu will be one of the states in Nigeria that will have the highest amounts of resources from the World Bank through the Federal Government, stressing: \u201cAs far as World Bank portfolios under Enugu State is concerned, the finances of Enugu State is in safe hands and we are very comfortable with the process that has been put in place and we commend His Excellency for enthroning prudence, probity and accountability in the state\u201d.\n\nEarlier, NG-CARES Team Leader, Dr. Martina Nwordu, explained that the delegation was in Enugu State on advocacy visit to evaluate what the state government has done so far on the programme and to encourage it to do more towards the full actualization of the set objectives of the programme aimed at impacting the lives of the poor and the vulnerable, positively.\n\nOn the outcome of their deliberations with Gov. Ugwuanyi and members of the State EXCO, Dr. Nwordu said: \u201cWe are absolutely impressed because this is the first time it is happening. EXCO gave approvals to the Chairman of the State-CARES Steering Committee on delivery platforms, and this is a very big achievement for Enugu State as regards this programme\u201d.\n\nIn her remarks, the Chairman of the State-CARES Steering Committee and Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Mrs. Kene-Uyanwune, listed the delivery platforms identified by the Enugu State government to assist the poor and the vulnerable in the society to include Ministry of Agriculture, Community and Social Development Agency (CSDA) and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nShe explained that the state government chose the platforms, which are already in existence in the state as requested by World Bank, because of their direct impact on the lives of the poor and the vulnerable in terms of fast disbursement of funds and other resources.\n\nThe Commissioner assured the delegation that the Enugu State government remains committed to transparency, accountability and due process in the management of the resources, revealing that the state government did match the available funds from the World Bank, which will cut across the delivery platforms to ameliorate the wellbeing of the beneficiaries in the state.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the Governor on Agriculture, Engr. Michael Ogbuekwe, his SMEs counterpart, Arinze Chilo-Offaih, the Board Chairman, CSDA, Enugu, Comrade Ibuchukwu Ezike and the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Finance, Dr. Benedict Ezema were also at the press briefing.",

The air ticket cost is the major difference in the Hajj fare.\n\nThis was announced today, 4th June 2022 by the NAHCON Chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan in an extraordinary meeting with Chief Executives of Muslim Pilgrims\u2019 Welfare Boards in the NAHCON Hajj House headquarters.\n\nFollowing announcement of the fare, the entire State Pilgrims\u2019 Welfare Boards\u2019 Executive Officers and other participants gave the NAHCON leadership a standing ovation for doing a job well done in holding down the Hajj fare below N2.5 million deposit despite the obvious challenges.\n\nThe gathering appreciated the effort put in place by the NAHCON Chairman in achieving this feat on behalf of Nigerian pilgrims.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Alhaji Kunle Hassan, reminded the gathering that all stakeholders do not have the luxury of time and from experience, we know that Saudi Arabia will not add an hour extra once the deadline for landing is due.\n\nHe informed that the Commission has requested for more Hajj seats, but NAHCON is still waiting for response. Therefore, in the meantime, all states are to work with and exhaust the allocations they have been granted instead of waiting for more.\n\nIt was disclosed by Alhaji Kunle Hassan that while visas of officials and pilgrims in the inaugural flight are ready, the states should start visa processing for all categories of registered pilgrims.\n\nThe Chairman urged others to send their staff to study the visa processing system due to recent modifications that were introduced by Saudi Arabia this year.\n\nHowever, those state board executives that are ready will be guided on the process today after the meeting.\n\nOn the issue of difficulty acquiring travel passports, Alhaji Hassan informed that the board member representing Nigeria Immigration Service had promised to assist any state board having problem processing the travel document for their pilgrims.\n\nHe, therefore, directed the state boards\u2019 Executive Secretaries to contact her for assistance.\n\nA call was made to intensify enlightenment on Hadaya to avoid pilgrims being dubbed. In addition, the NAHCON Chief Executive Officer said, it costs cheaper when paid from Nigeria due to the benefit of the foreign exchange.\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman disclosed that pilgrims will get their covid-19 PCR test done at a discounted rate of 30,000.\n\nAlhaji Nura Hassan Yakassai, NAHCON\u2019s Commissioner in charge of Policy, Personnel Management and Finance encouraged the states to conclude fund remittance to fast-track Hajj preparations and for processing of Basic Travelling Allowances.\n\nIn his closing remarks, the chairman of Forum of States, Alhaji Idris Ahmed Al\u2019 Makura praised the NAHCON board for the commendable job and called for cooperation from all quarters.",

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Saturday, lambasted the Federal Government and all the security agencies, accusing them of complicit silence and collective failure to arrest controversial Islamic cleric and bandit-sympathiser, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, in spite of his alleged many unguarded and alleged criminal statements.\n\nHURIWA in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said it is not surprising that while the state-controlled Department of State Services go after objective critics of government\u2019s unpopular policies, especially Christians like the Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Hassan Kukah; the late former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Obadiah Mailafia; the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has spared Gumi despite his inflammatory comments.\n\nThe group noted that Gumi, at a recent event in Abuja organised by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria and the Northern Consensus Movement, called for the establishment of a ministry of nomadic affairs to address the grievances of herders just like the Federal Government created a ministry for Niger Delta affairs.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, Gumi has definitely been speaking the mind of the complicitous bandit-enablers in government and that is why he has not been arrested because the Islamic cleric is considered a mouthpiece of both bandits launching attacks from the forests of the North-West and North Central states as well as a government agent, trumpeting its interest and shameless Fulanisation agenda in a non-conventional way.\n\nThe rights group said Gumi, who has been hobnobbing in the forests with notorious bandit leaders like Bello Turji and allegedly defending the killings and atrocious crimes of the terrorists before Nigerians, does not deserve to stay among decent people but should be arrested and detained in DSS custody until properly prosecuted in line with the counter Terrorism law.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cSheikh Gumi is the real terrorist sympathiser. A chronic bandit-sympathiser is not so different from a terrorist. It is shameful that the government let people like Gumi roam the streets while it held the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, hostage for one full year.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that Gumi is defending the killings, maimings and kidnappings done by Islamic bandits and Fulani terrorists while the government has tied Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, in Benin Republic with spurious charges.\n\n\u201cGumi, from all indication, is a terrorist-enabler. He has been indicted many times by grieving family members of kidnapped victims for acting as a middleman in the payment of ransom between the distraught families and bandits even as he had denied but government didn\u2019t bother to investigate because the government officials are complicit with terrorists.\n\n\u201cIn February 2021, a former Assistant Director with the Department of State Services, Dennis Amachree, said the compound where Gumi met bandits in Niger State to discuss the release of the abducted students and teachers of Government Science College, Kangara, was very close to a military post.\n\n\u201cNow, because when evil is left unstopped, it grows wings, an emboldened Gumi now call for a ministry for bandits, for savage criminals and bloodthirsty marauders who raped and killed both mothers and daughters! What gut? What audacity for Gumi!\n\n\u201cGumi has been deodorising evil. He must be stopped and arrested. Gumi may be doing the bidding of the powers that be who may have a hand in sinister plots to argue for establishment of a ministry for Fulani bandits using Niger Delta freedom fighters as example of why this travesty of the law should be committed.\n\n\u201cThere is a grand design by powerful persons of Fulani origin in government who have a plot to carve out a commission to benefit the Fulani terrorists who by the way ought to be degraded, decimated and exterminated given their horrendous crimes against humanity but here Gumi providing defence for them and even arguing that someone suspected of killing many people should be pardoned.\n\n\u201cThese are abominations. Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Arrest Gumi now! DSS do your job for once.\u201d",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintunsin, Abuja\n\nParty has appealed court judgment on statutory delegates \u2013 Adamu\n\nFurther postponement may cost APC participation in 2023 poll \u2013 INEC sources\n\nCommission seeks legal advice on Kano court judgment\n\nNWC overrules Oyegun committee, clears all 23 aspirants\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) is pressing ahead with the decision to allow only ad-hoc delegates pick its presidential candidate in this week\u2019s primary after opting to appeal the verdict of a Federal High Court in Kano that statutory delegates are qualified to participate in the shadow election.\n\nAll the 23 aspirants screened last week by the John Odigie-Oyegun led committee will also be allowed to contest for the ticket, APC National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu, said yesterday in an update ahead of the primary.\n\nHe spoke amidst fresh signals from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that any party that fails to submit the name of its flag bearer on Thursday, June 9 should forget about the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAdamu told reporters in Abuja yesterday categorically that statutory delegates remain excluded from the APC presidential primary.\n\n\u201cWe have served notice of appeal. The matter is in court. At the convention, statutory delegates are excluded,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu also indicated that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party had rejected the recommendation of the John Odigie Oyegun-led 7-man Presidential Screening Committee that 10 of the 23 presidential aspirants who appeared before it be disqualified.\n\nThe party chair said all the 23 would now be allowed to test their popularity at the primary.\n\nOyegun, speaking during the presentation of his committee report on Friday, had said the panel pruned the number of aspirants from 23 to 13 after considering each aspirant\u2019s \u201cability to lead, your background, your experience, your understanding of the Nigerian situation, your ideas as to how issues, difficulties, problems and the rest can be addressed and how the country can be moved forward became a principal consideration.\u201d\n\nBut The Nation gathered that soon after the presentation of the report, powerful individuals and interest groups began piling pressure on the NWC to throw the ticket open to all the 23 aspirants.\n\nExplaining the twist, Adamu said: \u201cI want to say very clearly that no aspirant has been disqualified. It\u2019s like sitting an exam. Even if you pass there is grading from first class to ordinary pass.\n\n\u201cSo no aspirant was disqualified. Incidentally the president has invited all of them to a dinner today (last night).\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview on the matter, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Barrister Felix Morka, said the Oyegun panel report was not binding on the NWC.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe screening panel only made recommendations to us to prune down our list. But that isn\u2019t binding on us. We gave them an assignment and they have delivered. We would now sit down and take a position on what they submitted to us.\n\n\u201cThe party had not disqualified anybody. Or have you heard from the party that any of the aspirants was disqualified?\u201d\n\nFurther postponement may cost APC participation in 2023 poll \u2013 INEC sources\n\nThere was apprehension in the APC yesterday that the party risked not participating in the 2023 presidential polls should it comply with the judgment of the Federal High Court, Kano, which states that statutory delegates are qualified to participate in the party\u2019s presidential primary which begins tomorrow in Abuja.\n\nBy the guidelines of INEC, the list of delegates to elect the APC presidential flag bearer either tomorrow or Tuesday must be submitted to it seven days to the primary.\n\nThe list, The Nation learnt yesterday, had been submitted and for statutory delegates to participate in the primary, a fresh one will have to be compiled and resubmitted to INEC.\n\nBut highly reliable sources in the commission told this newspaper yesterday that it is either the APC holds the primary as scheduled and submits the name of its flag bearer and other contestants on June 9 or forget about the presidential election next year.\n\n\u201cWe will stick to our timetable for the election and we will apply the law accordingly as the need arises, \u201d an INEC source said yesterday.\n\nAnother source said after granting the request for extension of time, the electoral body will not accede to another request as \u201cthat will cast serious doubt on its independence as an umpire.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, INEC was yesterday seeking legal advice on the judgment which was delivered within 10 days after the case was filed without the knowledge of three key defendants. The defendants were the Senate President, National Chairman of the APC, Speaker House of Representatives and INEC.\n\nThe APC is the only major party yet to wrap up its primaries. Its main rival, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held its primary penultimate Saturday and nominated former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as its candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, who resigned from the PDP to join the Labour Party, has been chosen by his new party as its candidate.\n\nIf INEC turns down a fresh request by the APC, the party may either go ahead and hold the primary as scheduled or compel the court to order INEC to further grant an extension due to \u201cextenuating circumstances.\u201d\n\nThree members of APC, namely Senator Mas\u2019ud Doguwa; Habibu Sani and Biliyaminu Shinkafi, had approached the Federal High Court to determine if Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act 2022 actually bars statutory delegates from voting.\n\nThe defendants were the Senate President, the National Chairman of the APC, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nIn the judgment, Justice A. M. Liman said the section of the Act does not exclude statutory delegates from voting during primaries.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cThat Section 84(8) cannot be interpreted to have excluded statutory delegates from voting at the convention, congress or meeting by virtue of Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Article 20(iv)(c) of the All Progressives Congress constitution, which allow statutory delegates to vote at convention, congress or meeting.\u201d\n\nStatutory delegates include President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, sitting and former National Assembly members, serving and former governors and their deputies, National Working Committee members, state party chairmen and secretaries, local government chairmen, their deputies, councillors and party chairmen in the 774 local government areas.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the APC, Felix Morka, said yesterday that the judgment has nothing to do with the APC, as it was not joined as a defendant in the suit.\n\n\u201cAPC isn\u2019t a party to the suit! We weren\u2019t joined, so, we are going ahead with our Convention as scheduled,\u201d Morka said.\n\nFindings confirmed that although INEC has sought advice on the import of the judgment, a reliable source in the commission said it was advisable for APC to go ahead with its convention or take a risk and miss the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWe are seeking legal consultations. But Nigerians need to know that this issue is purely a party affair, not INEC\u2019s problem. It is better for APC to look inwards to vacate the court order, or ask for a stay of the execution of the judgment instead of missing participation in the presidential poll.\n\n\u201cOur deadline for the submission of list of candidates remains June 9th, 2022. We cannot waive it for any party. The alternative is to alter the 2023 poll timetable afresh. This cannot augur well for our electoral system. We hope that the Judiciary will continue to assist our electoral system.\n\n\u201cThe facts of the matter are straightforward. Three APC members went to the Federal High Court in Kano on interpretation of Section 84(8). The defendants were the National Chairman of APC, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and INEC.\n\n\u201cOut of the four defendants, only APC National Chairman was served the notice of the suit, the three others were not aware not talk of entering defence. Only APC entered appearance before the court. The application was heard within 10 days without some important defendants. Yet, the Friday judgment was expected to be binding.\n\n\u201cThe proper thing would have been that the court will order the plaintiffs to put other defendants on notice.\n\n\u201cEven if you look at the case, the plaintiffs also joined issues with the defendants on Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution which has nothing to do with parties.\n\n\u201cThey also raised a dust over an article in APC Constitution which deals only with election into party organs. It is trite in law that a party\u2019s constitution cannot override the 1999 Constitution and the Electoral Act 2022. APC\u2019s constitution is inferior to the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cFor the records, there is a similar case on Section 12 of the Electoral Act in which the Supreme Court has reserved ruling. The ruling may have effect on the application of Section 84(8) of the same Act.\u201d\n\nAsked of what INEC might do with the judgment, the source added: \u201cWe will have legal consultations on Monday. We have not been officially served. We cannot have a position on the judgment until after the consultations.\n\n\u201cBut we can come up with an advisory on the likelihood of a party missing out of the ballot.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it was a declaratory judgment by the Federal High Court, Kano without any specific order on the defendants on don\u2019t do this or that. It is hanging. This is why it is dangerous to take a risk. That is the danger of delaying conduct of primaries. \u201c\n\nConcerning the implications of the judgment on primaries already conducted and concluded by APC, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other parties, the source said: \u201cThere is no need to review the primaries already concluded because a judgment or a law cannot be retroactive.\u201d",

People should ask those coming to ask them to vote for them to point to what they have been able to do for the people in the last years before coming to seek your votes.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the leader of the group, Deacon Obioma Daniel, the Chairman of Aba North Shoe Industrial Market and chairman Abia State Market Chairmen Forum described the choice of Ikonne as the flagbearer of the PDP in the 2023 election as the right one.\n\nDeacon Daniel who said that the emergence of Ikonne was divine pledged the support of traders towards ensuring that the PDP gubernatorial candidate emerged governor of the state in 2023.\n\nHe stated that they have implicit confidence that Ikonne whom he described as a seasoned administrator will pilot the affairs of the state creditably and also protect the interest of the traders as Ikpeazu has done over the years.",

          "text": "The Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu, yesterday said the lowest electricity generation was 2,661.82 Mega Watts (MW) because of the partial shutdown of the Oben Gas Plant to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Electricity System Operator (SO) of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) System Performance of 3rd June 2022, peak generation was 3,450.60Mw.\n\nThe report added that total energy generated was 3,105Mw while total energy sent out was 3,059Mw.\n\nMeanwhile, Aliyu, in a press statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mallam Isa Sanusi said: \u201cWe wish to notify the general public that the current dip in electricity generation is a result of the partial shutdown of the Oben Gas Plant to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment.\u201d\n\nThe incident, he said, unfortunately, occurred at a time when other power plants on other gas sources are undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing.\n\nRead Also: CBN assures EKO DisCo of support to improve power sector\n\nThe minister, however, noted that Seplat Energy Plc has mobilized equipment, material, and personnel to the site with a view to expediting the restoration of normal gas supply to the affected power plants.\n\nHe assured the public that the repair work would be concluded this weekend and normalcy will be restored.\n\n\u201cWhile pleading with electricity consumers with the current state of supply, we wish to assure the general public that efforts are being made for a sustained improvement of supply across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, energy allocation to the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) was reduced from 650Mw to 228.65Mw, representing a 64.8% decrease.\n\nIts management which disclosed this in a public notice assured its customers of distributing the allocation equitably.\n\nThe public notice reads in part: \u201cWe are aware that the instability of electricity supply has persisted.

          "title": "2023: Who wins APC presidential ticket?",
          "text": "The final lap of the race to pick the presidential flagbearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) starts tomorrow in Abuja. The party has screened its 23 presidential aspirants during the week and 10 of them were earlier reported to have been disqualified from partaking in the primary election by the Screening Committee.\n\nBut the leadership of the party soon disagreed with the recommendations of the John Odigie Oyegun chaired committee and announced that it will be allowing all the aspirants to have their day at the primary election. With that, the stage was set for all 23 aspirants to test their acceptability among chieftains and members of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nBut dramatic developments yesterday altered the entire dynamics of the race. Eleven Northern APC governors and leaders informed President Muhammadu Buhari of their decision to back power shift to the South. Based on their advisory, Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru, withdrew from the race. It is not clear if Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello and former Zamfara State Governor, Ahmed Yerima \u2013 the other Northerners in the race would follow the Badaru lead.\n\nOthers currently in the race for the ticket are former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, ex-Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Governor Kayode Fayemi, ex-Minister of State for education, Emeka Nwajiuba, ex-Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, former Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOthers include ex-Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, Pastor Tunde Bakare, Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, Ikeobasi Mokelu, former House of Representatives Speaker, Dimeji Bankole, Felix Nicholas, Senator Robert Borrofice, Tein Jack Rich and Uju Ken Ohanenye.\n\nAmong those reportedly left to slug it out for the presidential ticket of the ruling party, analyst are saying the obvious front runners include Tinubu, Osibajo, Lawan and Amaechi.\n\nOf all aspirants, only one will emerge as the flagbearer at the end of the political hostilities on Tuesday. This piece examines how the aspirants stand; their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their 2023 general elections prospects, were they to emerge as their party\u2019s candidate.\n\nYEMI OSINBAJO\n\nHe is the incumbent Vice-President of the country. He hails from Ogun State in the Southwest geo-political zone. He is known to have had political tutelage under Tinubu, who he served as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice for eight years in Lagos State. His emergence as running mate in 2015 was also down to his being favoured by Tinubu for the position following opposition to what would have been a Muslim-Muslim Buhari-Tinubu ticket. Osinbajo declared his intention to succeed Buhari on April 11, 2022.\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nBeing the current Vice President is a plus for him. It gives him ample opportunities to make contacts and improve on networks built up over the last seven years. His supporters are also citing the fact that he served as Acting President for a couple of months. Earlier, he was the Buhari administration\u2019s front man for some welfare and development initiatives. He was later stripped of most of his powers as these programmes were transferred to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs at the start of the second term in 2019.\n\nHe is an articulate speaker who is a senior pastor in the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) \u2013 one of Nigeria\u2019s largest Pentecostal congregations. He has embarked on nationwide consultations to sell his aspiration to delegates and critical stakeholders and is believed to have the backing of some governors and professionals under the platform of The Progressive Project (TPP). Some of his promoters are also touting the possibility of his being the preferred candidate of President Buhari.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nThe Vice President does not have the political structure required for the race. And the refusal of Buhari to endorse a successor is not working in his favour. Except for his home state \u2013 Ogun, where he is expected to put up a good showing following alleged support for him by the governor, Osibajo may not enjoy the support of the Southwest geopolitical zone where his political godfather Tinubu holds sway.\n\nHe will still have the likes of Tinubu and former governor Amosun to contend with in his native Ogun, especially with the presence of many prot\u00e9g\u00e9es of the former Lagos governor on the state\u2019s political scene. His chances in Ondo State are bleak with his friend, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu supporting Tinubu. He may also not be able to take delegates away from Ekiti Governor Fayemi who is in the race and Tinubu who enjoys a cult following in the state. Oyo does not look good for him because APC governorship candidate, Teslim Folarin, has declared that state\u2019s 99 delegates are for Tinubu. Osun is a no-go area.\n\nBut Osinbajo may garner some votes in Nasarawa State where Governor Abdullahi Sule is said to have some sympathy for him. But sources in the state say there are other factors that will decide how the delegates will vote. \u201cWe may have a situation where each delegate will vote according to the dictates of his or her leader,\u201d a source said.\n\nAnalysts say the Ikenne-born politician\u2019s best hope of emerging flagbearer lies in winning Buhari\u2019s endorsement, but that may just turn out to be a pipe dream, considering his strained relationship with some northern elements over the removal of the erstwhile Director-General of the Department of State Security (DSS), Lawal Daura, while Buhari was away on leave vacation. Political watchers say the Vice President is yet to be forgiven by this close group around Buhari who may be bent on taking their pound of flesh.\n\nPROSPECTS\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Osibajo will find it difficult to rally support in the Southwest zone. This will work against the APC and favour the PDP in the zone. He does not have any known support base or structure in the Southeast and South-south to wrestle with the PDP. He is also likely to flounder in the northern zones during the general election.\n\nAHMAD LAWAN\n\nHis coming into the race gave the strongest indication that the ruling party may not respect the power rotation principle reached at its formation between the north and the south. Supporters of his aspiration argue that the APC needs a northern candidate to keep PDP out of power.\n\nBut all of that has now been called into question with the resolution of the 11 Northern governors backing power shift.\n\nA three-time member of the House of Representatives, Lawan\u2019s emergence as President of the 9th Senate has enhanced his political clout and reach. But it has also led to rumblings in a section of Yobe State who grumble that he\u2019s done overtime having been in the National Assembly since 1999.\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nHe has the support of some members of the National Assembly and his governor, Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and his Imo State counterpart, Hope Uzodinma. He has also been backed vociferously by Senate Minority Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu. He is said to be hoping on being endorsed by the President. Aside that, there were assumptions that he may be backed by some northern governors and leaders largely on ethnic grounds.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nHe cannot boast of visible political structure outside his home state. He is not seen as a potential presidential candidate in the south. In 2015, he was supported by Tinubu, once President Buhari had indicated he preferred him to lead the legislative arm. But he was easily out-manouvered by former Kwara State governor, Bukola Saraki. It would take the concerted efforts of the former Lagos governor and other key APC leaders to push him over the line in 2019.\n\nHis name may not win him delegates across the country. His best hope of becoming flagbearer, again, revolves round the hope that Buhari would endorse him. But the pro-zoning agitation is still his major albatross as this could make delegates from the South defy all entreaties and vote against his candidacy. In any event, the decision of the 11 Northern governors has cut the ground from beneath him.\n\nAlso with the President not assenting to the Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill, only 2,340 adhoc delegates will participate in the exercise. The implication of this for Lawan\u2019s ambition is huge as his chances are weakened without the statutory delegates. Also likely to work against him is the perception that the National Assembly under him hasn\u2019t been outstanding. Many have derided it as a rubberstamp only too willing to do the bidding of the Executive.\n\nPROSPECT\n\nWith sentiments in the South decidedly against another Northerner taking over from Buhari who would have spent eight years in office by next year, a Lawan candidacy would go down like a lead balloon. He would be faced with impossible task of explaining why the APC reneged on power rotation \u2013 leading to crushing electoral defeat not only in The Southwest, but also in the Southeast where the push for Igbo presidency has been quite aggressive this time around. His prospects are no better in the South-south zone where he would be confronted by similar sentiments.]\n\nBOLA AHMED TINUBU\n\nThe former Lagos State governor is no doubt the foremost runner in the race. Tinubu parades intimidating political credentials with a network that cuts across several political tendencies. He was first aspirant to formally declare his intention to be president. He is one man with a strong passion and conviction to change the political, economic and socio-cultural narratives of the country. Also, no other aspirant has gone round as much states as him to woo delegates.\n\nHe is a much talked about aspirant seen by many as the man APC needs to confront PDP\u2019s Abubakar Atiku in 2023. His antecedents in Lagos State where he was governor for eight years, the institutional structures he built for the emergence of a new city state, his strong analytical mind and sense of judgement and ability to discover, nurture and promote potential are some of his virtues that even his political foes cannot deny. His rich private sector background as a high flier in Exxon Mobil, a multinational oil giant, and Delloite and Touche, an international accounting firm, prepared him as an all-round manager which explained his success in his turn-around management of Lagos state.\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nTinubu has the political structure required for the task ahead. He is visible politically in every state of the country, with over 5,000 different support groups rooting for his ambition. Majority of delegates in Ondo state are expected to vote for him with Governor Akeredolu leading the pack. Several support groups in the state working for the aspiration of Tinubu in the state. He will pocket all the votes of delegates in Lagos State. This needs little or no explanation. He has been the undisputable godfather of the state\u2019s politics since 2003.\n\nHe will garner more votes than anybody else in Oyo State on account of his age-long politics of inclusion. His allies and loyalists are on hand to ensure he wins the state. The delegates in Osun State are mainly his for the asking with Governor Gboyega Oyetola in charge. Tinubu will share the votes of delegates in Ogun with Osinbajo and Amosun. In Ekiti, delegates would be shared between state governor Fayemi, Tinubu and Osinbajo. However, the governor is expected to have the bulk of the votes in the state.\n\nTinubu will do well in Adamawa where he has key backers in the likes of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, former EFCC chairman, Nuhu Ribadu, and many others. In spite of faulting some statement credited to Tinubu recently, Lawal says he is still committed to seeing the former Lagos governor emerge as candidate. Bauchi State APC is rooting for him and analysts say the former Lagos governor looks good to get ample votes from delegates in Gombe and Taraba States.\n\nBorno is practically for him with former governor, Senator Kashim Shettima leading his squad. He may not do too well in Yobe State, being the home state of Lawan and Buni. Amidst permutations that the delegates in the Southeast will be shared between Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and Lawan, pundits and party sources say Tinubu will still garner sizeable votes in the region owing to his many years of relationship with some of the leading chieftains of the party in the region.\n\nTinubu is very popular in Nasarawa State where he has some foot soldiers helping with his campaign. He is expected to slug it out with Amaechi and Osinbajo for the votes of the delegates. His support base is equally huge in Niger State where the governor, Abubakar Sani-Bello is an ardent supporter. The presence and leadership of Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, in Benue APC assures him of the support of the delegates from the state. His recent warm reception in Kwara is a pointer to another state where he is quite strong.\n\nKatsina State looks very good for him with Governor Aminu Masari seen as one of his staunch supporters. He just concluded a triumphant visit to Kano where he received the enthusiastic endorsement of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and state delegates. He equally has reasons to be positive about Kaduna State. Sokoto is another safe zone for Tinubu. His relationship with Senator Aliyu Wammako, is long and enduring and expected to translate into votes for him.\n\nMost analysts agree he\u2019s in pole position to clinch the presidential ticket in an open, free and fair contest, barring any unforeseen development before or during the primary election.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nAmong issues that have been raised against Tinubu is that he is old at 70. There is also the suggestion that certain vested interests are not keen on him winning the party\u2019s ticket. He has also lost some of his old associates who for their own reasons have chosen to move on to new friends. He countered the claim that he is too old at 70 by saying that the job of a President calls for mental alertness and that he is not only mentally sound he is also as fit as a fiddle for the job.\n\nPROSPECTS\n\nTinubu\u2019s candidacy would galvanise nationwide support for the ruling party and energise voter turnout in the Southwest base. He may not help APC takeover the Southeast or South-South, but his ability to keep his stronghold means the party can reprise its electoral victories of 2015 and 2019 if it can manage a majority in the North while keeping hold of the Southwest, the bastion of support for the party.\n\nIn the North, he is as popular as he is in the Southwest that is eagerly waiting for him to emerge. Voters in the North will reward him for standing firmly with Buhari , leading to the defeat of an incumbent President, the first if its kind in Nigeria. Pundits see a man who has worked very hard building bridges for this project. He is widely seen as the best choice for the ruling party.\n\nROTIMI AMAECHI\n\nThe former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Chibike Amaechi, is a presidential aspirant to watch. He is leaving no stone unturned to succeed Buhari. But pundits say he will have to do much more to win the ticket. He has traversed the length and breadth of the country seeking the support of party chieftains and delegates for his dream to come through. Also, the tempo of his campaign slowed down after he had to resign his position in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, given the impression that he was not prepared to contest the election without his ministerial garb.\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nAmaechi has been Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly for eight years, Chairman of Forum of Speakers for eight years, two-term governor, Chairman of NGF for eight years, twice Director-General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation and minister for almost eight years. He tells anybody who cares to listen that he\u2019s the most qualified and equipped aspirant to lead a post-Buhari era.\n\nAmaechi will naturally win the votes from his native Rivers and do well in neighbouring Bayelsa State following the withdrawal of Timipre Sylva from the contest. He is also known to be strong in Kaduna State on account of his friendship with Governor El Rufai and Buhari.\n\nBut his strongest base up north appears to be Plateau State where his ties with Governor Solomon Lalong go back to their days as Speakers. He is also known to have supported the governor\u2019s electoral efforts in past. Lalong pointedly referred to this during the former minister\u2019s recent visit to Jos, when he said it was time for him to reap from his investment.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nHe presides over a River State APC that is split down the middle because of his long-running feud with erstwhile ally, Senator Magnus Abe. That rift denied the party a candidate at the 2019 governorship election.\n\nHis standing in the Southeast is not impressive and he will struggle to win delegate votes in the zone. And in the Southwest, he will lose woefully in the zone as no governor, leader or chieftain of the APC is known to be identifying with him.\n\nAmaechi has tried to bandy his close ties to the president as an advantage in the race. He even was turbaned Dan Ammanar in Buhari\u2019s hometown of Daura. So, even though the delegates\u2019 counts wouldn\u2019t make him the frontrunner, he would be hoping that a presidential anointing tilts the race in his favour.\n\nGENERAL ELECTION PROSPECTS\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how an Amaechi candidacy helps APC to retain power. His political spread cannot guarantee victory for the party. Even in his home state, incumbent Nyesom Wike is giving him no breathing space. Part of this war of attrition has seen the ex-minister entangled in the report of a panel of inquiry set up to probe his administration\u2019s sale of the state-owned turbines.\n\nAmaechi is currently in court to overturn the report of the panel which he claims was politically-motivated. This week would be crucial as the Supreme Court would rule whether the Rivers State government was in the right in setting up the panel. If the court upholds the indictment, it would be a blow to Amaechi\u2019s bid.\n\nApart from not being able pull through his succession plan in 2015, APC has been virtually neutralized as a force in the state. Not just that, his former Secretary for Government Abe, has become an implacable foe, locked in mortal combat with the former minister.\n\nThe former minister isn\u2019t going to enthuse Southwest voters neither is he going to snatch his South-South base which is a PDP stronghold. We can also say the same thing for the Southeast which would be frustrated that its strong push for the presidency hasn\u2019t been accepted by the two leading parties. He will be easily demolished by the PDP.\n\nJOHN KAYODE FAYEMI\n\nFayemi, who governs Ekiti state is also the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF). JKF is another contender for the coveted ticket. Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Tinubu\u2019s, he is not seen by pundits as a contender to bet on.\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nAs NGF chairman, two-term governor and former minister, Fayemi has built up an impressive network of political contacts across the country. Some analysts say he should not be underrated because he has been central to most happenings in the party in the last two years. Naturally, he is expected to win most of the votes in his state. He controls the structure from the ward to state level. But the visible imprints of Tinubu in Ekiti APC would cost him some delegates\u2019 support.\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have visible political structures outside his state and no governor is openly backing his aspiration. He is not being touted as Buhari\u2019s preferred candidate. Even in the southwest zone, the political strength of Fayemi is limited to his home state.\n\nPROSPECTS\n\nWith Atiku as PDP candidate, Fayemi would be a lightweight. He would also have to work hard to rally the Southwest to produce the sort of fervor Tinubu does among his supporters. Again, he, like most other APC aspirants, would struggle to make inroads in the Southeast and South-South zones.\n\nCHUKWUEMEKA NWAJUIBA\n\nThe former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba, is another aspirant to watch. He was the first to obtain the nomination forms and the first to return them. A well-connected member of the inner caucus of President Buhari\u2019s defunct Congress for Positive Change (CPC), sources within the Presidency said that Nwajuiba is one of the few Southeastern leaders that have the ears of the president. Some even refer to him as \u201cBuhari\u2019s son.\u201d\n\nThe former member of the House of Representatives is also leveraging on the influence of the Forum of Former Members of the House to reach out not only to the delegates but to other crucial organs of the party.\n\nDescribed by some party faithful as the dark horse in the presidential race, the politician\u2019s albatross is the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities (ASUU). Many have derided is decision to run saying the never-ending strike wasn\u2019t the best advertisement for his problem-solving abilities.\n\nYAHAYA BELLO\n\nKogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, started his presidential bid early, almost two years ago, when the agitation for power shift was intense and no Northerner contender dared toy with the idea.\n\nHe championed the position that zoning wasn\u2019t in the constitution of the ruling party. He stuck to this position despite other Northern politicians taking the position that zoning was based on some gentleman\u2019s agreement.\n\nThe governor has framed his aspiration by targeting young voters at the presidential election. He has actually done a lot to woo his targeted audience. He has also trumpeted his efforts at empowering women with strategic positions in his cabinet and campaign structure.\n\nBello used his assignment under the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee as Chairman of the Mobilisation and Sensitisation Committee of the just concluded membership registration and revalidation exercise to sell his aspiration to party faithful.\n\nThe tenacity with which he has been pursuing his ambition has won him the hearts of many party members, mostly youth, women and physically-challenged persons.\n\nAnother strong point is his closeness and loyalty to Buhari which would win him points with the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\nHowever, he lacks political structures and alliances outside his home state and that will count against him in the race. Also, it reamians to be seen whether the decision of Buhari and APC governors would affect his resolve to present him self for the contest beginning tomorrow.\n\nTUNDE BAKARE\n\nThe General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Lagos, Pastor Tunde Bakare, a fierce preacher, came into the political limelight following his series of critical and down to earth sermons and the courage to speak truth to power.\n\nIn 2011, his nomination as running mate to Buhari as then presidential candidate of the defunct Congress for Positive Change (CPC) became his major inroad to the political arena. Though qualified and competent to effectively carry out the responsibilities of the office of the president, Bakare lacks the structure and network to deliver him the ticket.\n\nThe lawyer turned clergyman and now politician is seen more in the media than reaching out to delegates who are the determinant factors of who gets what at the primary. Though he claims he had a divine mandate of becoming the 16th President of the country, earthly delegates in Abuja are set to give him a reality check.\n\nIBIKUNLE AMOSUN\n\nAmosun\u2019s biggest claim to fame in the ruling party is being one of the closest Southwest politicians to Buhari. In the politics of his home state, he is not a pushover. His current face-off with Governor Dapo Abiodun leaves him without home support. He is no threat to the leading contenders. He does not look anywhere near the presidential ticket and his candidacy will leave the APC trailing other parties in the presidential election.\n\nOGBONNAYA ONU\n\nOgbonnaya Onu, a founding member of the APC and ex-Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, is one of the aspirants from the Southeast. Highly respected by Buhari, the 70-year-old presidential hopeful may be banking on President\u2019s endorsement as consensus candidate. But he is most unlikely to get it as he lacks the required political structure needed for the task.\n\nDIMEJI BANKOLE\n\nDimeji Bankole, former Speaker of the sixth House of Representatives, whose bid for the Ogun State governorship seat fell flat at the last polls, is obviously not a serious contender in the race. He is considered to be one of the pretenders who are in the race for another motive.\n\nDAVE UMAHI\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, was the first aspirant from the Southeast to declare for the presidency. He joined the race immediately after Tinubu\u2019s declaration. Though he has a good record of performance as a state governor, he\u2019s a political paperweight at national level.\n\nComing from a zone with the lowest number of elected delegates for the convention, pundits rate him low and suggest that his bid is for relevance.\n\nROCHAS OKOROCHA\n\nWith his ongoing trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), The two-term former governor of Imo is definitely no longer in pole position to make anything worthwhile out of his presidential ambition. Also, the current face-off between him and governor of his home state, Hope Uzodinma, makes his aspiration a non-starter.\n\nRochas Okorocha remains the most colourful aspirant from the Southeast. In the whole pack he is something of a serial contestant. This attempt is his fourth. He is a great philanthropist whose kind gestures spread across the country and even nations of Africa. He may be going to the convention without a single delegate from his home state because the governor has openly cast his lot with Lawan.\n\nUJU KENNEDY\n\nHer courage to play where angels fear to tread, singles out Uju Kennedy, the only female aspirant in the race for the APC presidential ticket. She may not be going any further than the media mention she has enjoyed since joining the race.\n\nA political neophyte, what Uju has in courage she lacks in political credentials. Not known to have occupied any political office, the lawyer turned politician may find it difficult to secure the support of both the statutory and elected delegates at the shadow election of May 29 to become Nigeria\u2019s first female presidential aspirant.\n\nNICHOLAS FELIX\n\nThe presence of the youngest presidential aspirant has given a boost to the \u201cNot Too Young To Run Act\u201d. Though relatively unknown, Felix, a US-based pastor may have only succeeded in putting his name on the country\u2019s political map. But for him to emerge APC candidate he would need to pull a miracle that would rate the eighth wonder in the world.\n\nKEN NNAMANI\n\nFormer Senate President, Ken Nnamani\u2019s, attempt at occupying the country\u2019s highest office is seen by many as another race to nowhere. He lost his bid to become Deputy National Chairman of the party at the March 26 APC national convention of the party; many expect his presidential aspiration to suffer a similar defeat come May 28.\n\nAside from the fanfare that greeted the submission of his nomination forms in Abuja, Nnamani has disappeared from the radar. Observers say the former number three man is basing his aspiration on possible zoning of the presidency to the Southeast by the party.\n\nBEN AYADE\n\nThe emergence of Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, in the race for the APC ticket would not have been taken seriously but for the whopping N100 million payment for the nomination form. A man not known for frivolities, many are yet to understand his game plan.\n\nSome of his critics said the need to remain politically relevant may be the driving force. Having served as a senator and two-term governor, Ayade may be in the presidential race for negotiation and continued relevance post 2023.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThere was pandemonium in Abuja when a local vigilante member was set ablaze by an angry mob said to have been mobilised by a Muslim cleric at Tippa garage, located at the Federal Housing Estate in Lugbe Area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nTrouble was said to have started for the deceased vigilante, Ahmad Usman, 30, after he got into an argument with the cleric [name withheld], who is said to have rallied the mob numbering over 200 to lynch the victim.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above?

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged ECOWAS leaders to consider the victims of unconstitutional changes of government and the adverse consequences of isolation on them when taking any decision on the political situations in Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said this on Saturday in Accra, Ghana at the 6th Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Heads of State on the political situations in the three countries.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe president said he was concerned that since the last Summit of ECOWAS leaders on March 25 this year, not much has been achieved in terms of having an acceptable timetable for the conduct of elections to restore democratic rule in the affected countries.\n\nHe noted that although the military leadership in Burkina Faso has released President Kabore in line with the request by ECOWAS leaders, further measures must be taken to ensure his safety and full freedom.\n\nBuhari warned that the security situation in both Mali and Burkina Faso has reached alarming levels with incessant attacks by extremist groups on the civilian populace and military facilities, aggravating the humanitarian condition in the two countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018The deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Mali and Burkina Faso should be a source of serious concern to us as leaders in the region. As you may be aware, the world is still recovering from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which wrecked the global economy.\n\n\u2018\u2018While our economies begin to recover, the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine has led to a surge in prices of many commodities including foodstuffs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are, therefore, left with no option but to devise means of sustaining our economies by becoming more creative and evolving in finding other channels of demand and supply, in order to ensure that we cushion the effect of the war and prevent our economies from collapsing, and our people remain productive.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must, therefore, ensure that, in whatever decision we take, we must remember the mass of the populations in the affected countries, who are victims of the unconstitutional change of government and the adverse consequences of isolation brought about,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTo this end, Buhari called on the Authority to revisit the report presented by former President Goodluck Jonathan, the ECOWAS Mediator on Mali, on a transition timetable for the West African country.\n\nThe President noted that Jonathan had recommended 16 months transitional timeframe \u2018\u2018as well as his further personal appeal and observation to us to give the military leadership in Mali up to 18 months for the conduct of the election, starting from March 2022.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, Nigeria is also calling on the Authority to consider the proposal earlier made for the Chair to personally visit Bamako and present this proposal. Nigeria equally welcomes the magnanimous offer by President Macky Sall, Chair of the Assembly of African Union to accompany H.E. President Nana Addo to Bamako for the purpose.\n\n\u201cFrom our findings, we are certain that the high-level visit proposed would be welcomed by the military leadership and would achieve the needed consensus. At the same time, the region must be ready to provide the needed support to Mali to return to democratic rule as soon as possible.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the situation in Guinea and Burkina Faso, President Buhari expressed concern that, till date, their proposed timeframes are not in tandem with the expectations of the regional leaders as well as their respective citizens.\n\nHe urged the military authorities in Burkina Faso and Guinea to renew their determination and immediately provide acceptable timeframes for the return to democracy in their respective countries.\n\nHe announced that Nigeria fully supports any action, including imposition of further sanctions that the Authority may adopt to compel the military leaderships in the two countries to submit an acceptable electoral timetable.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, there is a need for ECOWAS to continue to engage the military leadership and key stakeholders in Burkina Faso and Guinea in order to reach an agreeable understanding, especially on the transition timeframes,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEarlier, the Chairperson of the Authority and President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, thanked his counterparts for their strong commitment to democracy, peace and stability in the region and for staying focused on the situation in the countries.\n\nAkufo-Addo, who acknowledged the presence of African Union Commission Chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said the Summit hopes to find lasting solutions to political instability and the resurgence of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats in the region since August 2020.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "Eleven northern governors have backed a southern aspirant for the ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\nThis led Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru, to withdraw from the presidential race, according to a statement from the governors on Saturday night.\n\nThe governors who signed the statement include; Bello Masari, Katsina; Nasir El-Rufai, Kaduna; Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi; Simon Lalong, Plateau; Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano; Bello Matawalle, Zamfara; Inuwa Yahaya, Gombe; Babagana Zulum, Borno; Sani Bello, Niger; and Abdullahi Sule, Nasarawa.\n\nHere is the Full Statement by Northern States\u2019 APC Governors and Political Leaders\n\nAPC governors and political leaders from the northern states of Nigeria today met to review the political situation and to further support our Party in providing progressive leadership amidst our national challenges. During our discussions, we welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s invitation to governors and other stakeholders to contribute to the emergence of a strong presidential candidate for the APC.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in office of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria. It is a question of honour for the APC, an obligation that is not in anyway affected by the decisions taken by another political party. We affirm that upholding this principle is in the interest of building a stronger, more united and more progressive country.\n\nWe therefore wish to strongly recommend to President Muhammadu Buhari that the search for a successor as the APC\u2019s presidential candidate be limited to our compatriots from the southern states. We appeal to all aspirants from the northern states to withdraw in the national interest and allow only the aspirants from the south to proceed to the primaries.

          "title": "Atiku\u2019s candidacy and Nigeria\u2019s delicate balance",
          "text": "If power does not go to the south in 2023, the pivotal role of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar will have to be scrutinised. His life ambition is to be president of Nigeria and his influence on the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) effectively ensured that the main opposition party did not zone presidency to the south. With Rt Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, dropping out at the last minute and handing over his votes to Atiku, a fellow northerner, there was going to be only one outcome. Atiku secured 371 delegate votes, outscoring Governor Nyesom Wike who got 237. The margin of 134 is attributed to the Tambuwal effect, to the chagrin of many southerners.\n\nDr Iyorchia Ayu, the PDP chairman and Atiku\u2019s long-time associate, was caught on video celebrating Tambuwal as a \u201chero\u201d. The immediate implication is that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will now have to take a decision: to zone its ticket to the north to counter Atiku or zone to the south for the sake of national sensitives. The easiest way to achieve rotation was for the two leading parties to zone to the south. Head or tail, presidential power would have gone to the south. However, the choice of Atiku as PDP\u2019s flagbearer will test APC\u2019s fidelity to the political understanding on rotation. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the APC chairman, has been telling us there is no decision yet on zoning.\n\nTo refresh our memories, next year will mark the 30th anniversary of Atiku\u2019s presidential ambition. His first attempt was in 1993 under the now-defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP). With the Option A4 experiment performed by the electoral commission, there were four stages to become a presidential candidate. Hence the name: Option A4. The first was at ward level, the second at local government, the third at state and the fourth at national. Every state had a presidential flagbearer, and since Nigeria had 30 states then, there were 30 contestants in each of the two parties. The SDP presidential convention was held at the Jos Township Stadium, Plateau state, on March 27-29.\n\nAtiku was the SDP candidate from Adamawa, Bashorun MKO Abiola from Ogun and Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, former SDP chairman, from Borno. These were the top contenders. Kingibe had most of the SDP governors on his side, Atiku had Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adia (rtd) and his political machinery, while Abiola had name recognition and widespread goodwill. At the end of the first round of voting in which delegates had to pick three contestants in order of preference, Abiola came tops with 3,617 votes, Kingibe second with 3,225 and Atiku third with 2,066. There was no clear majority. That meant there was going to be a run-off where delegates were limited to picking only one choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbiola went into intense negotiations with Yar\u2019Adua/Atiku, reportedly promising to make Atiku his running mate if they jointly fended off Kingibe. With deal sealed, Atiku informed his supporters just before the second round of voting that he was quitting the race. \u201cDistinguished national delegates, I very much appreciate your endorsement last night\u2026 But in order to ensure a rancour-free election tonight, I beg and I plead with you to allow me to discontinue the race,\u201d he said. Abiola polled 2,683 votes to Kingibe\u2019s 2,456 and was crowned the presidential candidate. He ended up picking Kingibe, and not Atiku, as his running mate and went on to win the June 12, 1993 poll. It was sadly annulled.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku kept nurturing his ambition. After winning the 1999 governorship in Adamawa on the platform of the PDP, he was picked as VP candidate by President Olusegun Obasanjo. But since he had his eyes on the presidency, he set up campaign structures ahead of 2003 \u2014 despite Obasanjo being eligible for second term. He said he had three options: to support Obasanjo, to go with Dr Alex Ekwueme, and to contest himself. He later pulled back but Obasanjo still blocked him in the PDP in 2007. He defected to the Action Congress (AC), ran for president and came third behind Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (PDP), sibling of his mentor, and Maj-Gen Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP).\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua terminally ill, Atiku returned to the PDP to pursue his ambition, insisting that it was the north\u2019s turn after the south had done eight years through Obasanjo. President Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner who became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death in May 2010, also wanted to run in 2011 and disingenuously denied the existence of power rotation in the PDP. Atiku rallied the north to produce a \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d to face Jonathan at the primary, with Gen Ibrahim Babangida, Dr Bukola Saraki and Gen Aliyu Gusau all showing interest. The Northern Political Leaders Forum (NPLF), led by Mallam Adamu Ciroma, picked Atiku but he still lost the ticket to Jonathan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a sense, the bitterness over power rotation in 2011, not ameliorated in any way by Atiku\u2019s bid to get PDP\u2019s ticket, gravely poisoned the geo-political atmosphere and I am of the opinion that we are still suffering from the consequences. Jonathan went ahead to win the presidential election in 2011, claiming 16 out of the 17 southern states and seven of the 19 northern states. Some key northern politicians supported him, allegedly with the pact that he would do only one term. Atiku stayed behind until it became clear Jonathan would run again in 2015. He walked out on the party, teamed up with the newly formed APC \u2014 an amalgam of four opposition parties \u2014 to help crush PDP.\n\nAtiku re-launched his presidential quest in APC, but he could only come third in the primary as Buhari got the ticket with 3,430 votes. Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso came second with 974 votes, while the former vice-president scored 954. In 2017, with the message quite clear that Buhari would seek a second term, Atiku returned to PDP yet again to continue the pursuit of his life ambition of being president. He was promoted as the best northerner to tackle Buhari in the 2019 presidential poll and he did not do his chances any harm by winning PDP\u2019s primary, getting 1,532 delegate votes and pushing Tambuwal, who was heavily backed by Wike, to a very distant second with 693 votes.\n\nHaving lost the election to Buhari in 2019, Atiku was assumed to have ended his Aso Rock pursuit. It was expected that with Buhari in power from 2015 to 2023, it was only logical for PDP and APC to pick candidates from the south next. But Atiku would have none of it. He came back on the scene and has now won the PDP ticket, in the process kicking against the power rotation he had vehemently stood for in 2011. \u201cThe PDP, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning,\u201d he said in an interview. I recall arguing in 2010 that Atiku was only interested in actualising his lifelong ambition and not particularly keen on the rotation policy.\n\nBy now spitting on power rotation, Atiku has somehow vindicated my perception of him: that all he wants is power. He has participated in every presidential primary since 2007 \u2014 zoning or no zoning. The Atiku I know is not an ethnic champion or bigot, contrary to the impression he created in 2011 when he wanted the PDP ticket by any means necessary, even dangerously invoking John F. Kennedy\u2019s quote about \u201cthose who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable\u201d. I testify that he is a broadminded Nigerian with friends and associates across every tribe and tongue, but he was so desperate for the ticket in 2011 he gleefully played the regional game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, I want to be clear: I believe Atiku has every right to contest and has not broken any law by doing so. I also believe he is competent and has the experience to lead the country. However, he has proved not to be much of a statesman. His life-long ambition has the potential to upset Nigeria\u2019s fragile balance at a time there is so much discontent with the union. Moreover, there are equally competent and experienced southerners. Our nationhood is constantly under threat because of our fault lines and sensitivities. I worry deeply that we are threading this divisive path yet again. If he wins the presidential election, power could be in the north for 12, or even 16, years non-stop.\n\nIt is particularly worrisome because of the inevitable scenarios. Whatever the APC does at its presidential convention this week will come with challenges. One, if the ruling party goes ahead to field a southerner, our troubling fault lines may be magnified. It may be cast as North vs South, as we saw in previous elections in parts of the country with the attendant consequences that we are still having to live with. I am one of those who believe that regional tensions are a major distraction to Nigeria\u2019s development as sectional groups and ethnic champions continue to heat up the polity and make parts of the country ungovernable just to score a point. We can\u2019t progress like this.\n\nTwo, if the APC decides to go north so as to snuff out any potential advantage that fielding Atiku can confer on the PDP, that would even be more problematic. We are going to be left having to pick between six and half a dozen, or between and betwixt. The majority of southerners may be left with a feeling of being edged out of the game, and this can only further widen and deepen our fault lines and create a hostile polity for several years to come. It is glaring that there will always be consequences either direction APC faces: north or south. Unfortunately, when the deed has been done, it is the rest of us, who are neither APC nor PDP, that will have to live with the consequences.\n\nThere is a third scenario: if APC/PDP decide to field northerners, the possibility of a third force \u2014 which will unfortunately further divide us along regional lines \u2014 may be stronger than ever. A possible southern solidary forged with some northern states may upset the APC/PDP duopoly and redraw our electoral map. I am not saying it is a certainty, but we have eight months to the elections and there is enough time for planning, realignment and mobilisation of forces. There will be unpalatable dynamics as regional tensions will become well pronounced again. All these scenarios because the PDP, in a bid to help the northern aspirants, did not do the rational thing on zoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTINUBU\u2019S OUTBURST\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu broke the internet on Thursday and Friday following his series of outbursts in Abeokuta, Ogun state, while addressing delegates to the APC presidential convention. The former governor of Lagos state, who is seeking his party\u2019s presidential ticket, outlined how he has been betrayed by the people he toiled for day and night to help get into positions of power. While I cannot judge him for feeling the way he does (I think every human being will feel bitter about betrayals), I am amazed that he said all that in a public place, on camera and at a time no candidate had been openly endorsed by President Buhari. I think Tinubu needs to be calming down. Tact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUNIFORMED KIDNAPPERS?\n\nSamuel Kanu Uche, the head of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), is arguably the most prominent victim of kidnap-for-ransom in recent times. He was abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state on Sunday. He said it took a N100 million ransom to get him and two other clerics freed. He made serious allegations against soldiers whom he said were involved in the dastardly crime. Although I flinched when he described them as \u201cFulani and non-Christians\u201d because it sounds like the profiling that has become the order of the day, the military authorities will do Nigerians a world of good by investigating this diligently. Creepy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDREAM KILLERS\n\nYou can never make up some things about this our country. D\u2019Tigress, our enterprising and inspirational female basketball team, fought tooth and nail to qualify for the 2022 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia. We were still clinking glasses to celebrate the feat when the Nigerian government announced that we were withdrawing from international basketball for two years \u201cto revamp the sport from the grassroots\u201d. There is apparently a power tussle in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) and the best way to resolve it is to slice off our nose to spite our face. We are killing the spirit of these athletes. What a country. Senseless.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nMr Tanko Sabo, from Kaduna state, became an instant sensation on Wednesday when he disclosed that he had reinvested the money he made as a delegate in the welfare of his people. He did not reveal exactly how much he made but said he paid N6.9 million as WAEC and NECO fees for 150 orphans and the underprivileged, spent N3.2 million to buy 42 customised football jerseys for youths in his community, and another N350,000 to support elders, women and \u201cexecutive beggars\u201d. The economics of electioneering can be seen in the trickle-down effect in Sabo\u2019s case. It is like wealth redistribution, although we would be overstretching things by saying he is Robin Hood. Amusing.",

The first was at ward level, the second at local government, the third at state and the fourth at national. Every state had a presidential flagbearer, and since Nigeria had 30 states then, there were 30 contestants in each of the two parties. The SDP presidential convention was held at the Jos Township Stadium, Plateau state, on March 27-29.\n\nAtiku was the SDP candidate from Adamawa, Bashorun MKO Abiola from Ogun and Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, former SDP chairman, from Borno. These were the top contenders. Kingibe had most of the SDP governors on his side, Atiku had Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adia (rtd) and his political machinery, while Abiola had name recognition and widespread goodwill. At the end of the first round of voting in which delegates had to pick three contestants in order of preference, Abiola came tops with 3,617 votes, Kingibe second with 3,225 and Atiku third with 2,066. There was no clear majority. That meant there was going to be a run-off where delegates were limited to picking only one choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbiola went into intense negotiations with Yar\u2019Adua/Atiku, reportedly promising to make Atiku his running mate if they jointly fended off Kingibe. With deal sealed, Atiku informed his supporters just before the second round of voting that he was quitting the race. \u201cDistinguished national delegates, I very much appreciate your endorsement last night\u2026 But in order to ensure a rancour-free election tonight, I beg and I plead with you to allow me to discontinue the race,\u201d he said. Abiola polled 2,683 votes to Kingibe\u2019s 2,456 and was crowned the presidential candidate. He ended up picking Kingibe, and not Atiku, as his running mate and went on to win the June 12, 1993 poll. It was sadly annulled.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku kept nurturing his ambition. After winning the 1999 governorship in Adamawa on the platform of the PDP, he was picked as VP candidate by President Olusegun Obasanjo. But since he had his eyes on the presidency, he set up campaign structures ahead of 2003 \u2014 despite Obasanjo being eligible for second term. He said he had three options: to support Obasanjo, to go with Dr Alex Ekwueme, and to contest himself. He later pulled back but Obasanjo still blocked him in the PDP in 2007. He defected to the Action Congress (AC), ran for president and came third behind Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (PDP), sibling of his mentor, and Maj-Gen Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP).\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua terminally ill, Atiku returned to the PDP to pursue his ambition, insisting that it was the north\u2019s turn after the south had done eight years through Obasanjo. President Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner who became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death in May 2010, also wanted to run in 2011 and disingenuously denied the existence of power rotation in the PDP. Atiku rallied the north to produce a \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d to face Jonathan at the primary, with Gen Ibrahim Babangida, Dr Bukola Saraki and Gen Aliyu Gusau all showing interest. The Northern Political Leaders Forum (NPLF), led by Mallam Adamu Ciroma, picked Atiku but he still lost the ticket to Jonathan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a sense, the bitterness over power rotation in 2011, not ameliorated in any way by Atiku\u2019s bid to get PDP\u2019s ticket, gravely poisoned the geo-political atmosphere and I am of the opinion that we are still suffering from the consequences. Jonathan went ahead to win the presidential election in 2011, claiming 16 out of the 17 southern states and seven of the 19 northern states. Some key northern politicians supported him, allegedly with the pact that he would do only one term. Atiku stayed behind until it became clear Jonathan would run again in 2015. He walked out on the party, teamed up with the newly formed APC \u2014 an amalgam of four opposition parties \u2014 to help crush PDP.\n\nAtiku re-launched his presidential quest in APC, but he could only come third in the primary as Buhari got the ticket with 3,430 votes. Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso came second with 974 votes, while the former vice-president scored 954. In 2017, with the message quite clear that Buhari would seek a second term, Atiku returned to PDP yet again to continue the pursuit of his life ambition of being president. He was promoted as the best northerner to tackle Buhari in the 2019 presidential poll and he did not do his chances any harm by winning PDP\u2019s primary, getting 1,532 delegate votes and pushing Tambuwal, who was heavily backed by Wike, to a very distant second with 693 votes.\n\nHaving lost the election to Buhari in 2019, Atiku was assumed to have ended his Aso Rock pursuit. It was expected that with Buhari in power from 2015 to 2023, it was only logical for PDP and APC to pick candidates from the south next. But Atiku would have none of it. He came back on the scene and has now won the PDP ticket, in the process kicking against the power rotation he had vehemently stood for in 2011. \u201cThe PDP, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning,\u201d he said in an interview. I recall arguing in 2010 that Atiku was only interested in actualising his lifelong ambition and not particularly keen on the rotation policy.\n\nBy now spitting on power rotation, Atiku has somehow vindicated my perception of him: that all he wants is power. He has participated in every presidential primary since 2007 \u2014 zoning or no zoning. The Atiku I know is not an ethnic champion or bigot, contrary to the impression he created in 2011 when he wanted the PDP ticket by any means necessary, even dangerously invoking John F. Kennedy\u2019s quote about \u201cthose who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable\u201d. I testify that he is a broadminded Nigerian with friends and associates across every tribe and tongue, but he was so desperate for the ticket in 2011 he gleefully played the regional game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, I want to be clear: I believe Atiku has every right to contest and has not broken any law by doing so. I also believe he is competent and has the experience to lead the country. However, he has proved not to be much of a statesman. His life-long ambition has the potential to upset Nigeria\u2019s fragile balance at a time there is so much discontent with the union. Moreover, there are equally competent and experienced southerners. Our nationhood is constantly under threat because of our fault lines and sensitivities. I worry deeply that we are threading this divisive path yet again. If he wins the presidential election, power could be in the north for 12, or even 16, years non-stop.\n\nIt is particularly worrisome because of the inevitable scenarios. Whatever the APC does at its presidential convention this week will come with challenges. One, if the ruling party goes ahead to field a southerner, our troubling fault lines may be magnified. It may be cast as North vs South, as we saw in previous elections in parts of the country with the attendant consequences that we are still having to live with. I am one of those who believe that regional tensions are a major distraction to Nigeria\u2019s development as sectional groups and ethnic champions continue to heat up the polity and make parts of the country ungovernable just to score a point. We can\u2019t progress like this.\n\nTwo, if the APC decides to go north so as to snuff out any potential advantage that fielding Atiku can confer on the PDP, that would even be more problematic. We are going to be left having to pick between six and half a dozen, or between and betwixt. The majority of southerners may be left with a feeling of being edged out of the game, and this can only further widen and deepen our fault lines and create a hostile polity for several years to come. It is glaring that there will always be consequences either direction APC faces: north or south. Unfortunately, when the deed has been done, it is the rest of us, who are neither APC nor PDP, that will have to live with the consequences.\n\nThere is a third scenario: if APC/PDP decide to field northerners, the possibility of a third force \u2014 which will unfortunately further divide us along regional lines \u2014 may be stronger than ever. A possible southern solidary forged with some northern states may upset the APC/PDP duopoly and redraw our electoral map. I am not saying it is a certainty, but we have eight months to the elections and there is enough time for planning, realignment and mobilisation of forces. There will be unpalatable dynamics as regional tensions will become well pronounced again. All these scenarios because the PDP, in a bid to help the northern aspirants, did not do the rational thing on zoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTINUBU\u2019S OUTBURST\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu broke the internet on Thursday and Friday following his series of outbursts in Abeokuta, Ogun state, while addressing delegates to the APC presidential convention. The former governor of Lagos state, who is seeking his party\u2019s presidential ticket, outlined how he has been betrayed by the people he toiled for day and night to help get into positions of power. While I cannot judge him for feeling the way he does (I think every human being will feel bitter about betrayals), I am amazed that he said all that in a public place, on camera and at a time no candidate had been openly endorsed by President Buhari. I think Tinubu needs to be calming down. Tact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUNIFORMED KIDNAPPERS?\n\nSamuel Kanu Uche, the head of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), is arguably the most prominent victim of kidnap-for-ransom in recent times. He was abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state on Sunday. He said it took a N100 million ransom to get him and two other clerics freed. He made serious allegations against soldiers whom he said were involved in the dastardly crime. Although I flinched when he described them as \u201cFulani and non-Christians\u201d because it sounds like the profiling that has become the order of the day, the military authorities will do Nigerians a world of good by investigating this diligently. Creepy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDREAM KILLERS\n\nYou can never make up some things about this our country. D\u2019Tigress, our enterprising and inspirational female basketball team, fought tooth and nail to qualify for the 2022 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia. We were still clinking glasses to celebrate the feat when the Nigerian government announced that we were withdrawing from international basketball for two years \u201cto revamp the sport from the grassroots\u201d. There is apparently a power tussle in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) and the best way to resolve it is to slice off our nose to spite our face. We are killing the spirit of these athletes. What a country. Senseless.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026\n\nMr Tanko Sabo, from Kaduna state, became an instant sensation on Wednesday when he disclosed that he had reinvested the money he made as a delegate in the welfare of his people. He did not reveal exactly how much he made but said he paid N6.9 million as WAEC and NECO fees for 150 orphans and the underprivileged, spent N3.2 million to buy 42 customised football jerseys for youths in his community, and another N350,000 to support elders, women and \u201cexecutive beggars\u201d. The economics of electioneering can be seen in the trickle-down effect in Sabo\u2019s case. It is like wealth redistribution, although we would be overstretching things by saying he is Robin Hood. Amusing.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Four rising sectors in African tech",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem had its best year ever in 2021 when it raised $5.2 billion (per Partech data), and it was predicted by investment tracking platform, Africa: The Big Deal, that the continent is on its way to raising $7 billion in 2022. It is not a surprise that fintech dominated last year\u2019s total funding, accounting for 63% or $3 billion of the funding that went to African startups. This year, so far, African startups have raised $2.1 billion, according to data from TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker, with fintech still leading the way with $660 million.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t look like fintech\u2019s dominance will wane anytime soon in Africa, there are other sectors on the continent getting significant funding, and you should be paying attention to them.\n\n1. AI\n\nBefore this year, African startups struggled to be involved in the AI conversation. In 2020, when AI companies globally attracted $36 billion, AI companies on the continent could only raise $11.63 million. There were concerns that Africa would be left behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to this slow pace in catching up with AI development, which threatens the future of Africans in an increasingly digital world. But one startup was all it took to bring Africa\u2019s AI industry to prominence. InstaDeep.\n\nCompany to watch: InstaDeep\n\nFounded in 2014 in the Tunisian city of Tataouine, InstaDeep\u2019s decision-making AI design allows it to boost productivity across a wide range of companies and industries. In the global AI race, dominated by the US and China, InstaDeep is the only African startup involved in shaping the evolution of the technology.\n\nIn January, it raised $100 million\u2014the only record funding into the African AI industry this year\u2014solidifying hopes that Africa can play on the global AI scene. It is being primed to take on massive projects such as creating an early-warning system for COVID-19 and a predictive railway timing system.\n\n2. Edtech\n\nAfter the pandemic disrupted education, the world turned to edtech solutions to continue learning in an efficient and effective way. While many edtech companies around the world benefited from this, as the industry attracted an influx of funding, African edtech companies struggled to tap into this opportunity. In 2021, when edtech globally raised $20 billion, African edtech companies raised less than $40 million. But Africa has an education crisis, which sees over 100 million children out of school across different educational levels on the continent. While there isn\u2019t a funding boom yet in edtech in Africa, there is a huge market here. There have been impressive efforts by African companies to solve the continent\u2019s educational problems.\n\nCompany to watch: Ulesson and FoondaMate\n\nUlesson\n\nNigerian startup, Ulesson was Africa\u2019s most funded edtech platform last year, raising $22.5 million across 2 funding rounds. Ulesson\u2019s work can be seen as pioneering for the edtech space; it brought Tencent and Owl Ventures, some of the world\u2019s biggest edtech investors, to the continent through its funding rounds.\n\nFoondaMate\n\nSouth African startup, FoondaMate teaches high school students using a WhatsApp bot that looks like 2 friends chit-chatting. Last month, FoondaMate raised $2 million to expand its unorthodox solution to more high school students in the country. WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in Africa, with 192 million users, as of 2018. In Foondamate\u2019s country of primary operation, South Africa, 95% of South Africans say they use their WhatsApp every month. FoondaMate told TechCabal that it has helped over 400,000 students cutting across more than 10 languages from over 30 countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia, targets 50 million users in the next few years and is willing to expand to achieve that.\n\n3. Cleantech\n\nSeventy-five percent of the world\u2019s population without access to electricity and renewable energy sources reside in Africa. Increased funding in clean energy by investors will help Africa fill this deficit. This has also made cleantech the closest industry to upsetting fintech this year, if the current momentum is maintained. The biggest funding ticket on the continent so far went to a cleantech company, making it the second most funded industry so far, this year.\n\nCompany to watch: Sun King\n\nSolar company, Sun King, raised $260 million in a Series D round to expand access to off-grid power to customers in Africa and Asia. It reported that it reached 18 million people in a decade of operations in Kenya, and is tripling its customers in Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania. Sun King said it will use $100 million to expand its pay-as-you-go solution and allow users to power bigger home appliances in the markets it operates in.\n\n4. Agritech\n\nAfrica is facing its worst food crisis in 10 years, with 27 million people experiencing extreme hunger in Nigeria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya; and there are fears that 11 million more could become hungry in 3 months if nothing is done. This food crisis is exacerbated by the high cost of food, recurring droughts, conflicts on the continent, and the Ukraine-Russia war. More than ever Africa needs to be food-sufficient because, for the most part, it has had to rely on humanitarian efforts to feed its citizens. So far, this year, African agritech companies have raised $115 million per TechCabal\u2019s funding tracker.\n\nCompany to watch: ThriveAgric\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers through financing received from crowdfunders. Then it joined Y Combinator and other notable accelerators, and it looked like it was going to be a happily-ever-after story. But things got bad in 2020 when it couldn\u2019t pay back its crowdfunders; apparently, the pandemic had affected its business model. It survived the turbulence through resilience, a characteristic that is admirable in solving hard problems, especially in Africa, and bounced back when it raised $56.4 million in debt financing to expand to Zambia, Kenya, and Ghana. Since ThriveAgric didn\u2019t go away in 2020, it seems it never will\u2014at least not without putting up a fight.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Founder of Babymigo speaks on reducing maternal deaths in Africa",
          "text": "Kemi is the co-founder of Babymigo, a Nigerian femtech startup founded in 2017 to expand access to quality information on pregnancy and parenthood. It works by providing a digital platform where expectant, pregnant, and nursing mothers can connect with their peers and experts as well as find local health and welfare services. Overall, it creates an inclusive support system for new and expecting parents to help make informed decisions during pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nTechCabal had a conversation with Kemi about Babymigo\u2019s background, challenges, motivation, and future plans.\n\nBabymigo website\n\nBabymigo\u2019s background\n\nHannatu Asheolge: How did the idea of Babymigo come about?\n\nKemi Olawoye: As a physiotherapist, I worked at a hospital where it was my job to lead antenatal classes, which included exercise. In my interactions with the pregnant women there, I discovered that a lot of them were misinformed on maternal health issues and were also subscribed to harmful cultural beliefs. When I met my co-founder, who also worked in the health sector, we decided to do something to combat this misinformation.\n\nHA: It\u2019s been 4 to 5 years since your company launched, and it has accomplished a lot. As CEO and co-founder, what have your key achievements been?\n\nKO: We\u2019ve seen a steady increase in the number of users since our launch. Now, we have up to 250,000 users on our platform, including pregnant women and new parents. We also raised our pre-seed in this period, which led to a lot of international partnerships and recognitions. Some notable ones include the Google Black Founders Fund and the GIST Initiative by the US Department of State.\n\nHA: What are some of your biggest challenges?\n\nKO: There are two major challenges we\u2019ve faced. The first one is human resources. Finding the right people who are committed to our vision of reducing maternal and child mortality rates was quite difficult, but I believe we\u2019ve managed to get past that. We now have built a team of passionate people.\n\nThe second challenge was more about an error in our initial plan. We didn\u2019t involve our users in our solutions, and this led to some dissonance between what we were working on and what our users actually needed us to work on.\n\nHA: What motivates you?\n\nKO: The statistics on child and mother mortality rates in Nigeria are my biggest motivation. Nigeria is currently one of the worst places in the world to have a child. Statistics show that 1 in 22 women that will get pregnant in Nigeria will most likely die from pregnancy-related complications due to misinformation and lack of adequate support.\n\nKemi Olawoye\n\nThe role of tech in improving maternal healthcare\n\nHA: How big of a role do you think tech can play in improving maternal health in Nigeria?\n\nKO: There\u2019s a growing number of people in Africa now with access to the internet. We can leverage this internet access to spread healthy information to them. Also, providing a community with millions of other moms is a great way to counter harmful cultural beliefs around pregnancy. It\u2019s easier to learn and believe something when there are millions of other women who are learning with you and confirming these beliefs.\n\nHA: What singular aspect of maternal healthcare in Nigeria do you think needs the most urgent intervention?\n\nKO: If I had to pick one, I\u2019d say addressing the inaccurate information on these cultural beliefs.\n\nHA: If you could describe the Nigerian femtech sector in one word, what would it be?\n\nKO: I\u2019d pick \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d.\n\nHA: What are the things you believe will accelerate the growth of the maternal health sector in Nigeria?\n\nKO: The first thing will be to identify policies and interventions that affect outcomes in terms of maternal and child health. The second thing will be restructuring or improving our current healthcare system. About 50% of Nigerians are already living below the average income level. This means that more than half of the female population cannot afford to pay for antenatal care in a regular hospital. The government needs to provide quality healthcare for free or at affordable rates for these women in order to lower the child and maternal mortality rates.\n\nHA: You\u2019ve mentioned quite a number of solutions. How do we incorporate technology into these solutions? How can tech help?\n\n\n\nKO: There can be digitising of some routine healthcare services. These can be in the form of online consultations or even digital classes which can go a long way. For a number of women, visiting a clinic is time-consuming and being able to reach a doctor online will go a long way to help women gain access to health services.\n\nNew services and future plans\n\nHA: Babymigo recently launched the Mamacare plan. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nKO: Mamacare is a maternity plan that allows mums to access antenatal child delivery and baby care services in about 120 multi-partner hospitals across Nigeria.\n\nHA: What are some of the things to expect from Babymigo in the next 5 years?\n\nKO: The plan is definitely to continue empowering more mums across Africa. In the next 3 years, we hope to provide healthcare services to 10 million mums across the African continent.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at geographical expansion, as maternal health issues are not peculiar to Nigeria. We\u2019re looking at expanding to Ghana and Kenya within the next 5 years. Another thing we\u2019re looking at is expanding our services. We hope to be able to partner with telecom service providers to provide information via SMS for mums in rural areas who do not have access to the internet.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday night met with all the aspirants for the presidential seat on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe president who urged the aspirants to chose a consensus candidate before the June 6-8 convention of the party, however, set a criteria for choosing the candidate, adding that such a candidate must, \u201cbe appealing to the electorates, amongst others\n\n\u201cI wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\nThe President who also urged the aspirants to look beyond personal ambitions, called on them to put national and party interest first.\n\nHe called on the aspirants to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nRead also: Buhari meets APC presidential aspirants\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

Ikomi and others made appearances for the Prosecution.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings, Ikomi told the court that he had another application to be allowed to take evidence by oath to make for faster proceedings.\n\nThis application was vehemently opposed by the defence counsel, Chief Otomewo arguing that there was no provision for the use of Statement on Oath at the Magistrate\u2019s Court.\n\nCounsel to Prosecution informed court that the provisions of Section 255 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law, Delta State as well as the Evidence Act to which it refers allow it.\n\nAccording to the Prosecution counsel, the prosecution witness was on a security assignment and so could not appear in court and the matter was consequently adjourned for rulings as shown in the records of the court.\n\nFollowing the prosecution\u2019s submission, Otomewo said that, there were some lawyers whose names were not in the Fiat stressing that they always come to court because they had no job to do.\n\nAngered by Otomewo\u2019s comment, Chief Robinson Ariyo who is a Chief at the Palace of the Olu of Warri with traditional title of the \u201cEgogo (Mouthpiece) of Warri Kingdom warned Chief Otomewo never to make such insinuating remarks about him or he would receive an insult.\n\nIn a swift response, the Magistrate asked if Chief Ariyo had any case in the court and if not he should leave insisting that she would not recognize Ariyo as a Chief.\n\nResponding, Chief Ariyo informed the Court that he was one of the nominal complainants in the matter\n\nbeing a Chief in the Palace and the Council of Chiefs being the body that wrote the Petition.\n\nIt will be recall that ever since the matter commenced, the Magistrate had continued to target Chief Ariyo refusing to either call him a Chief or record him with the suffix Chief.\n\nIt is also on record that the Magistrate had never recorded Chief Ariyo as a Chief even though Chief Ariyo announces himself as such.\n\nAccording to the prosecution counsel, the refusal of Magistrate Diejomaoh to recognise Ariyo as a Chief while according Otomewo as a Chief was an indication that she was playing ethnic politics having served as a Lawyer under Chief Otomewo.\n\nThe Prosecution counsels, however, said that they had tried to distinguish between an objection arising from the lack of neutrality of a court and other forms of objection.\n\nAccording to them, this goes to the root of lack of fair haring arising from the developments and decisions in the case.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on, Saturday night met with all the aspirants for President on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), at State House, Abuja, urging them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nThe president, according to a statement from Femi Adesina, his spokesperson, added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday night met with all the aspirants for President on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC, at State House, Abuja, urging them to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday night urged APC presidential aspirants to hold consultations, and come up with a formidable candidate before the party holds its primary election between June 6-8, 2022.\n\nThe president met with the aspirants at the State House, Abuja. The President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges.\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.",

          "text": "Okezie Ikpeazu, the governor of Abia State, has described how the Nigerian Army reached out to him and then carried out the infamous invasion of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, in September 2017.\n\nIn an interview with Vanguard, the governor said that the Nigerian Army commander approached him (Ikpeazu) at the time and told him (the officer) that he (the officer) had orders to arrest Kanu, but the army did not mention an all-out invasion.\n\nIn Abuja, Ikpeazu gave an interview about the military invasion of the Afaraukwu Ibeku country house of arrested IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu on September 17, 2017.\n\nIkpeazu who reiterated that he was not pre-informed of the infamous raid, said the Nigerian Army commander in Enugu at the time paid a visit to his office that he had orders to arrest Kanu.\n\n\u201cI was not told that anything like that (invasion) was going to happen. I only saw the General Officer Commanding who was at Enugu that time; he showed up in my office and told me that he would arrest Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cI asked him why? He said he had orders to arrest him. I told him to give me few hours and he obliged. I called the traditional rulers and asked them to talk to Nnamdi\u2019s father who was a traditional ruler to persuade Nnamdi to come and have a word with the GOC, but Nnamdi Kanu refused, saying he was under siege already in his house. I didn\u2019t know that the soldiers were already everywhere.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ikpeazu, the agitation for self-determination being championed by Kanu, was borne out of the injustice being perpetrated against the South-East by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat is happening in the South-East now is as a result of total disregard of the interest of the South-East people by the government at the centre. What has happened in the South-East is a combination of all manner of things. One is the total disregard of the interest of the South-East by the centre and flagrant and provocative comments from both the government and various elements and characters.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to find peace wherever injustice pesters. Nnamdi Kanu is saying that if we are not wanted, could we go? There are three options available to every man: integrate me, let me be part of it and the other one; endure until you die or exit but the system is saying: endure until you are annihilated. The leadership of the nation is not engaging.\u201d",

          "text": "Senate President, Dr Ahmed Lawan, and Ebonyi state Governor, Engr. David Nweze Umahi, have promised to support each other, should either of them win the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential election primary scheduled between June 6 and 8, 2022.\n\nThey made the promise Saturday evening when Lawan visited Umahi in his Abuja residence.\n\nSpeaking during the visit, Senator Lawan urged Umahi to support him or whoever emerges the presidential candidate as the APC should be united to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have always spoken about the need for our party to continue to play the role God designed for us. To the glory of God, the All progressives Congress is the biggest party n Nigeria today. Our party is in control of the Presidency, the two chambers of the National Assembly, a number of state governments across the country and so on.\n\n\u201cIt is our common belief in our party that this trend should continue so that in the 2023 general elections, Nigerians should vote for our party to produce the next President, who will replace President Muhammadu Buhari when he completes his tenure on May 29, 2023. The National Assembly should also have majority Senators and Reps members. From 22 government houses, we hope to increase the number. This requires us to continue to be focused in all situations. We will continue to insist on brotherhood. No contest should make us fail.\n\n\u201cI came here to tell you that even though you are an aspirant like I am, we are all aspirants akin of the same father and mother. It is everyone\u2019s desire who aspires to be the most successful. But at the end of the day, our wish is for our party to be united. After our convention, when the winner of the presidential primaries emerges, we expect the rest of the aspirants to show solidarity, to remain committed to the party; to ensure that we win the general election.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to assure you that if you emerge in the convention, you will have me as your number one supporter, because I believe that the ideals, the ideology and philosophy of APC are the same in our hearts. Therefore, it is my duty to ensure the success of our party at the polls. Similarly, if God makes it possible for me to emerge, I am sure that you will be by my side throughout the campaign for APC to win the general election.\u201d\n\nResponding, Governor Umahi said the Senate President can count on his unalloyed support if he wins the primary election as he will always stand by the party.\n\nUmahi revealed that though the South East was in desperate need to produce a president from the region, he will support whoever is endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari, in order for APC to remain a united party.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was very happy when you reminded me few days ago about the palace coup that produced you as Senate President. Our party has come of age, in terms of discipline. This is the only time that I am seeing that aspirants, who are looking for one thing, are not castigating themselves. They are talking well of themselves. It shows, like what you said, that we are from one mother and one father.\n\n\u201cI have always said it, even while I was in PDP, if you know President Muhammadu Buhari very well, you will know that he is a very good man. He is being hurt by enemies, but he will not cast anyone out. He is an extraordinary president. That is why I said that even though the South East needs the Presidency so badly, just like North East, whatever decision Mr President takes, I will stand by the decision.\n\n\u201cPersonally, if the decision is not in my favour, I won\u2019t fight the decision. I will continue to support it. I will support whoever that is chosen. Like I always say, power belongs to God. God sees the nitty gritty of the heart of men. He sees who is destined to take the nation to where it is supposed to be.\n\n\u201cSo, I can assure you that if that mantle falls on you, I will feel very lucky because even if it is not me, if you are able to have somebody who shares the same character in a context with you, we will be better for it. So, I stand in partnership with you that if it is you, I will be the first to jump out and congratulate you. If it is me, like you said, it is a partnership that God built before now.\n\n\u201cWe started working together before now. We are building on the past and present relationship. We are not studying ourselves. So, it is the same with the rest of 11 aspirants. Any of them that God chose as the candidate, both of us will work together to support the President and support such a person. You are a man of discipline. You are not just visiting me. You are visiting other aspirants. So, whoever the president chooses is the will of God.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council(NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company, that not only sell seed but teach farmers advance planting technique for optimum yield.\n\nGAWAL was established in Nigeria in 2006 and has\n\nbeen committed to the agricultural development of Nigeria through the production and supply of quality crop seeds.\n\nAs one of the large-scale seed companies in Nigeria, it has supplied over 20,000 mt rice and maize seeds to Nigeria farmers in over 30 states.",

          "title": "Nigeria Committed to Energy Transition, Reducing Gas Emission \u2013 Silva",
          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

Customs HC Project Limited was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalize the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAhmed had explained that was to be financed by sponsors \u201cwho will in return look over the investment in the concessionary period of 20 years\u201d while it has the potential to generate up to $176 billion for the country.\n\n\u201cSo this investment of $3.1 billion is broken down into capital investment of $1.2 million which will be done in three phases over 36 months by these investors and $1.1 million is our projection of the operational cost over the 20-year period of the implementation of this project.\n\n\u201cThis project has the potential to yield up to $176 billion of revenue for the project and the consortia that are providing this investment are going to be paid over time according to the schedule that is negotiated for their investments including their profits and cost,\u201d she had said.\n\nAsked to explain the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited, Ahmed said: \u201cThe E-customs project was approved by Council. And there were some challenges that had to do with disagreements between the concession partners. Remember that the government was not a partner of the concession; it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice have intervened. There were several meetings to try to iron out the difference. So it has to do with shareholders, who has what responsibility. And at the end of the day, I think one of the partners in the concession did not agree with the arrangements\u201d, she stated.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has urged all presidential aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress to consult among themselves, build consensus and produce a formidable candidate for the party.\n\nThe President addressed the candidates at a State House dinner in Abuja on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges,\u201d the President said, as quoted in a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina.\n\nREAD ALSO: Northern Governors Ask APC To Zone Presidential Ticket To South\n\n\u201cAhead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held behind closed-doors.\n\nFocus on victory\n\nThe President said the meeting was a continuation of the on-going consultative process aimed at ensuring a smooth and strategic emergence of a standard bearer, who will lead the APC to a resounding victory in the upcoming presidential polls.\n\n\u201cLooking at this assemblage of personalities and considering your rich pedigree of accomplishments in life, I have come to the conclusion that our party, the APC, is rich in human resources and also that our nation is blessed with capable people that can successfully steer the ship of state into the future,\u201d President Buhari said.\n\nHe added that with his first-hand knowledge of the demands of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the expectations of the citizens, \u201cI must salute your courage and your selfless spirit, in volunteering to serve in the highest office of the land.\u201d\n\nThe President added: \u201cOur party, the APC, has won two successive presidential elections in 2015, first when we were in the opposition and in 2019 when I sought re-election. Both processes were achieved through unity of purpose, strategic alignment, consultation, fairness, determination and effective leadership. In both instances, national and party interests were overriding factors in our deliberations and decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 General Elections are fast approaching in a global, regional and national environment that is constantly changing and challenging. This demands that our party should become more aware of the changing environment, be responsive to the yearnings of our citizens, re-evaluate our strategy and strengthen our internal mechanism so that we would sustain the electoral successes.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the party, recognizing the significance of all these demands, has over time developed several democratically acceptable processes and policies, that promote consultation, internal cohesion and leadership to facilitate victories at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled the consultation he had held with stakeholders \u201cthat would help the electoral fortunes of our party, beginning with the State Governors. This is the second in the series and I still look forward to meeting with party stakeholders. These steps are being taken to ensure that the unity and cohesion of the party are sustained and to provide direction.\n\n\u201cAmongst others things, I reminded the APC Governors of the need for the party to proceed to the 2023 Presidential elections with strength, unity of purpose and to present a flag bearer who will give Nigerians a sense of hope and confidence, while ensuring victory for our party. I extend a similar reminder to all of you distinguished aspirants.\u201d\n\nSaying the APC will on Monday June 6, 2022 commence its national convention during which one candidate will be picked by delegates to fly the flag of the party for the 2023 Presidential Election, President Buhari said he was aware that there is anxiety among party members about the outcome of the process.\n\n\u201cGiven these circumstances, I charge you to recognize the importance of the stability and unity of the party, which cannot be overemphasized,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations, \u201cuntil we successfully make the choice on the candidate that will fly the flag of our party for the presidential elections and make the party stronger. I seek your support in this all important responsibility.\u201d\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.\n\nResponding on behalf of the aspirants, former Governor of old Abia State and immediate past Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, and Vice President, \u2018Yemi Osinbajo, thanked the President for his leadership and guidance, pledging that they would hold the consultations as counseled \u201cfor the unity and strength of our party, the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "More drama unfolded on Friday as the All Progressives Congress (APC) ramps up preparations for a special convention for its presidential primary.\n\nThe ruling party will elect its presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections at the primary scheduled to hold between Monday and Wednesday next week.\n\nWith about three days to the exercise, the atmosphere seems tense for some party faithful over the chances of their preferred aspirants to emerge as the APC presidential candidate.\n\nAmid the increasing possibility for a consensus candidate to emerge, the ruling party says it has dropped 10 of the 23 aspirants who appeared before its Presidential Screening Committee led by former APC National Chairman and erstwhile governor of Edo State, John Oyegun.\n\nREAD ALSO: I Did Not Disrespect Buhari In Abeokuta, I Have High Regard For Him \u2013 Tinubu\n\nConsensus Or Contest?\n\nMr Oyegun presented the report of the committee to the national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on Friday in Abuja where he confirmed the disqualification of the aspirants, although he did not disclose their identities.\n\nHe also hinted that 99 percent of the presidential aspirants agreed to support a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cWe engaged every aspirant on the issue of consensus; it is a pleasant surprise that 99 per cent agreed that the party is supreme and that whatever the party decides \u2013 with proper consultation \u2013 they will likely accept. Only one exception, who said \u2018I will accept consensus only if it is for me\u2019.\n\n\u201cI think it is a point that needs to be made and emphasised. So, that gives you a lot of leeway in the hours ahead to trim down even more drastically but, finally, we think we should not be afraid of a contested primary if anybody insists on a contest,\u201d Oyegun told Adamu as he handed over the committee\u2019s report.\n\nHe also explained that contrary to rumours making the rounds, the committee did not screen former President Goodluck Jonathan as claimed.\n\nNot Interested\n\nA total of 28 aspirants picked the APC presidential nomination and expression of interest forms sold at N100 million. Some of them paid for the forms themselves in some cases while various interest groups purchased the nomination tickets for their preferred aspirants.\n\nFormer President Jonathan and the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina, were among those whose forms were bought for them, but the duo have since condemned the move and rejected these forms.\n\nBesides both men, the APC also dropped the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; and Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, from aspirants to be screened by its panel.\n\nThereafter, 23 aspirants appeared before the APC Presidential Screening Committee which cleared 13 for the exercise, with 10 others dropped.\n\nPresidential hopefuls who appeared before the committee, in no particular order, include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, APC chieftain Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and oil magnate, Tein Jack Rich.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; popular Pastor Tunde Bakare, former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima; and former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi, also appeared before the panel.\n\nAlso screened were former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former presidential candidate, Nicholas Felix; a female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye; Ondo North Senator, Ajayi Boroffice; and a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers include Governor David Umahi Ebonyi; former Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, and former Minister of Information under the late General Sani Abacha regime, Ikeobasi Mokelu.\n\nAt the end of the primary, the party is expected to produce its candidate who will contest for the office of the President alongside the flagbearers of other political parties in the 2023 general elections.",

          "text": "Ukraine said Saturday its forces were managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Severodonetsk despite Russia \u201cthrowing all its power\u201d into capturing the strategic eastern city.\n\nAt least seven civilians were reported killed in the Lugansk region where Severodonetsk is located and in the southern city of Mykolaiv, while a revered wooden church was reported to be on fire because of the fighting.\n\nLugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said in an interview posted online that the invading forces had captured most of Severodonetsk, but that Ukraine\u2019s forces were pushing them back.\n\nREAD ALSO: AU Head Says \u2018Reassured\u2019 After Talks With Putin On Food Shortages\n\n\u201cThe Russian army, as we understand, is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,\u201d said Gaiday.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers have managed to redeploy, build a line of defence,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, in a televised interview broadcast on Telegram Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe are currently doing everything necessary to re-establish total control\u201d of the city, he added. But he acknowledged the situation was \u201cquite difficult\u201d, with street fighting and artillery exchanges.\n\nRussia\u2019s army claimed some Ukrainian military units were withdrawing from the city.\n\nSeverodonetsk is the largest city still in Ukrainian hands in the Lugansk region, where Russian forces have been gradually advancing in recent weeks after retreating or being repelled from other areas, including around the capital Kyiv.\n\n\u2018Put Russia in its place\u2019\n\nTens of thousands of people have been killed, millions forced to flee and towns turned into rubble since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an all-out assault on his pro-Western neighbour on February 24.\n\nWestern powers have slapped increasingly stringent sanctions on Russia and supplied arms to Ukraine but divisions have emerged on how to react.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Friday Putin had committed a \u201cfundamental error\u201d but said Russia should not be \u201chumiliated\u201d so that a diplomatic solution could be found.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba reacted Saturday by saying such calls \u201conly humiliate France\u201d and any country taking a similar position.\n\n\u201cIt is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite diplomatic efforts, the conflict has raged in the south and east of the country.\n\nUkrainian officials announced Saturday the death of four foreign military volunteers fighting Russian forces but did not specify when or under what circumstances they died.\n\nThe International Legion of Defence of Ukraine, an official volunteer brigade, named the men and published photos of them, saying they were from Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and France.\n\nThe deaths of the two men named from the Netherlands and Australia had already been reported and France\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday a French volunteer fighter had been killed in combat.\n\nUkraine also reported two victims from a Russian missile strike on Odessa in the southwest, without specifying if they were dead or injured.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said it had struck a \u201cdeployment point for foreign mercenaries\u201d in the village of Dachne in the Odessa region.\n\nIt also claimed a missile strike in the northeastern Sumy region on an artillery training centre with \u201cforeign instructors\u201d.\n\nFears over food\n\nApart from the human toll, the conflict has caused widespread damage to Ukraine\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nOn Saturday, Ukrainian officials reported a large Orthodox wooden church, a popular pilgrim site, was on fire and blamed Russia.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said \u201cRussian artillery again hit\u201d the church, adding bombardment earlier this week had \u201ckilled four monks and severely wounded four others\u201d.\n\nRussia continues to prove \u201cits inability to be part of the civilised world,\u201d Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said in a statement.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry blamed \u201cUkrainian nationalists\u201d for the blaze and said its forces were not operating in the area.\n\nThe church was built in 2009 on the site of another church that was blown up in 1947.\n\nRussian troops now occupy a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and Moscow has imposed a blockade on its Black Sea ports, sparking fears of a global food crisis. Ukraine and Russia are among the top wheat exporters in the world.\n\nThe United Nations said it was leading intense negotiations with Russia to allow Ukraine\u2019s grain harvest to leave the country.\n\nPutin said Friday there was \u201cno problem\u201d to export grain from Ukraine, via Kyiv- or Moscow-controlled ports or even through central Europe.\n\nThe UN has warned African countries, which normally import over half of their wheat consumption from Ukraine and Russia, face an \u201cunprecedented\u201d crisis.\n\nFood prices in Africa have already exceeded those in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and the 2008 food riots.\n\nAfter a meeting with Putin in Russia Friday, the head of the African Union, Senegalese President Macky Sall, said he was \u201cvery reassured\u201d.\n\nSall added Putin was \u201ccommitted and aware that the crisis and sanctions create serious problems for weak economies\u201d.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov repeated the government\u2019s appeal for the swift delivery of heavy artillery in a telecast address to the Globsec-2022 forum on international security Saturday.\n\nHe was asked if Kyiv\u2019s forces could push the Russians out of the country by Christmas if they got the equipment they had asked for.\n\n\u201cI cannot forecast definitely what month we will kick them out, but I hope \u2014 and it\u2019s absolutely a realistic plan \u2014 to do it this year.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The seven-man All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Screening Committee headed by the former national chairman of the party, Chief John Oyegun on Friday announced that it had cleared 13 of the 23 aspirants screened, while recommending10 for disqualification ahead of the party\u2019s Presidential primary election scheduled for next week.\n\nOf the 13 aspirants cleared, five of them are regarded as the frontrunners, with Vice President Yemi Osibanjo leading. The next four in order of their strengths are Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and the former Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOyegun revealed the recommendation to disqualify 10 presidential aspirants when he led other members of the committee to submit their screening report to the Abdulahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.\n\nOyegun said: \u201cMy first comment is that we are indeed a very lucky party. We had a lot of others, prominent Nigerians both within the country and outside that had applied, but for whatever reasons, could not proceed with their applications. The point I want to make is the quality of the people that want to govern this country.\n\nThe committee\u2019s chairman said there were two aspects or criteria for the screening, which included the constitutional qualification to aspire to be a president, saying every single aspirant that presented himself qualified in that regard.\n\n\u201cAnd so the ability to lead, background, experience, understanding of the Nigerian situation, ideas as to how issues; difficulties, problems and the rest can be addressed and how the country can be moved forward became principal considerations.\n\n\u201cWho are you? What have you achieved? What is the understanding of your nation? And what do you think you can contribute to move the nation forward? It was on the basis of that that we made our final short list. I don\u2019t want to read the names, I think we leave that to you. But we have a short list, we brought the number severely down to 13.\n\n\u201cWe could have cut it a little shorter, but we wanted, deliberately, the younger element to surface; for them to be seen, for them to be noticed. It\u2019s for the party to decide the preferred candidate. It is also an opportunity to showcase the kind of people that exist within the party.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of consensus, Oyegun revealed that 98 to 99% of the aspirants agreed that the party is supreme and that whatever the party finally decides with proper consultation, they would accept.\n\nAlso, on the issue of zoning, Oyegun urged the party to address it, which he said was already creating division between the North and the South in the ruling party.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe flag does not belong to me, it doesn\u2019t belong to any of us, it is the flag of the party, a corporate body called the APC and it is my hope that that spirit will be obeyed.

          "text": "Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina, on Friday faulted claims that President Muhammadu Buhari asked members of the PGF to pick a consensus presidential candidate for the APC.\n\nHe said that contrary to reports, the President only met with the governors and gave them his \u201cexpectation\u201d for the forthcoming presidential primary of the party.\n\nAdesina stated these in a piece titled, \u2018Visit to Spain: Let\u2019s Buga for Mr. President\u2019.\n\nMaking clarifications on what transpired during the meeting, the presidential spokesperson explained that Buhari never discussed issues bordering on zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidates during his conversation with the governors.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari told them what he would like to see at the APC presidential primary to elect a presidential candidate early next week.\n\n\u201cHe said no word about zoning, consensus, or imposition of candidate. He just charged them to let their plans converge, so that the party would put its best foot forward. Shortly after the meeting, we headed for the airport.\n\n\u201cA short time into the about five hours flight, I went on social media, to see that all hell had broken loose. Trust some Nigerians.

Did you see anything like that in the speech?\n\n\u201cI tell you. When some Nigerians don\u2019t see what they expect in a speech or statement, they simply conjure and create their own.

          "title": "Tinubu: My Comments in Ogun Lost in Translation, My Respect for President Buhari High, Unfailing",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, on Friday moved fast to douse the anger created by the speech he delivered Thursday while on a consultation visit to the delegates of the party in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during which he bragged about installing President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\nOn the same day, President Buhari returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit to Spain and shortly after met with a two-man delegation of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nIn a statement he pushed out Friday, Tinubu said his comments had been misinterpreted by the media and that he did not disrespect President Buhari.\n\nThe APC Presidential aspirant in the statement he signed declared that his respect and regard for Buhari as Commander-in- Chief of this nation, and as a person, are high and unfailing.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy respect and regard for President Buhari as Commander-in- chief of this nation and as a person are high and unfailing. I shall never denigrate him. I certainly did not do so in Abeokuta. We have been political partners for a long time and I hope that partnership continues well into the future. I would do nothing to jeopardize it. I believe our party is the best hope for the nation to right itself. I believe I have a future role larger than the one I now have. I also believe President Buhari has a continuing and important role to play even after his tenure as president is over.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I consistently supported the president and his administration. Even when the administration has come under intense criticism, my feet have always been planted solidly in defence of the president. The president personally nominated me to coordinate his re-election campaign in 2019. He did this not because I opposed him or because I was indifferent. He did so, because I was firmly with him in 2015 and has stood firmly beside him ever since.\n\n\u201cWhen I publicly announced my aspiration to seek the party nomination for the upcoming presidential election, I stressed that my strategic objective was to build on the foundation laid by the Buhari administration. In fact, I believe I was the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of this presidential intention. It was a sign of the respect I have for him and his office. It is unthinkable that I would aspire to be the leader of the party for which I hope to be the next flag bearer. It makes no sense at all to do such an indelicate, unseemly thing.\n\n\u201cI am proud of my role in the advent of the APC and its electoral successes. But President Buhari, of course, stands as the main driver of this success. He was elected president twice. He has borne the weight of national governance for seven years. Nothing can rival that. I would not dare belittle what he has done and what he has meant to the party and nation.\u201d\n\nTinubu described Buhari as a Nigerian patriot and a man of integrity and that these qualities won him tremendous mass support leading to electoral victory in 2015 and 2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am proud to have been his partner in the political merger that became the APC and in making history by ousting an incumbent president for the first time in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI make no apologies for seeking the party\u2019s nomination. I believe I have something important to offer Nigeria that the other aspirants do not have, although I see them as good and committed Nigerians in their own rights. While I want this office, there are certain things I will not do and certain lines I shall not cross. I shall never belittle myself by denigrating the president or his office. I dare not seek an office and disrespect it at the same time.\u201d\n\nBuhari Back from Spain\n\nPresident Buhari yesterday returned to Abuja after a three-day state visit Spain.\n\nShortly after his return, the President met with a two-man delegation of the PGF, led by its Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nBagudu and the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, met behind closed-door with President Buhari.\n\nSources said Friday night that the meeting was a follow up to the one held on Tuesday before the President travelled to Spain when he appealed to the 22 APC governors to allow him determine who among the 23 aspirants will fly the party\u2019s presidential flag during 2023 general elections.\n\nIt was gathered that Bagudu told President Buhari that the APC governors had met this week to review their Tuesday meeting with the President.\n\nHe was said to have also told the President that the PGF would still meet this weekend ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries convention scheduled for next Monday.\n\nPresident Buhari, sources said, will this weekend meet with critical stakeholdees in the APC with a view to carrying everybody along on what format the party\u2019s presidential primaries will take.\n\nMeanwhile, the President is expected to leave Abuja today for Accra, Ghana to attend an extra ordinary meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nPresident Buhari who will be accompanied by some Ministers and top government officials is expected back in Abuja later today.\n\nSaraki, Babachir Lawal Castigate Tinubu\n\nAPC chieftain, Babachir Lawal and former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, on Friday came down hard on Tinubu over his Abeokuta speech in which he talked about how he enthroned political leaders.\n\nIn his response to Tinubu, Saraki stated that when he opposed the plan to foist a Muslim-Muslim presidency on Nigeria in 2014 he acted in the national interest and believed Nigeria was bigger than anybody\u2019s ambition, including that of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the head of his Media Office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in response to the speech by Tinubu in Abeokuta, claiming that Saraki and others opposed his desire to be running mate to President Buhari in the 2015 elections, noted that he would oppose any plan that causes a religious crisis in a multi-religious country like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen I and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 stood against having a Muslim-Muslim ticket, it was not a decision targeted at any individual or group but one taken in the national interest. Asiwaju knows this and he is just being mischievous by presenting this decision as something aimed at stopping his ambition.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that the decision to oppose the plans by some people to make APC present a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2015 was in the national interest and I will take the same stand today, tomorrow, and any other day. My stance is based on the fact that such a ticket is not good for the unity of the country and will further accentuate one of our fault lines.\n\n\u201cThe opposition to a Muslim- Muslim ticket was not targeted at Tinubu or any other person. It was a decision that even all party leaders know helped the victory of the party and also worked for the unity of the country. That decision is not about self but national and collective interests. It is a decision which served the purpose of the people of Nigeria and I have no regret supporting it\u201d, Saraki stated.\n\nWhile expressing surprise that Tinubu refused to move on and still sulked over what happened in 2014, the former Governor of Kwara State added that the APC presidential aspirant had become so fixated on the Muslim-Muslim ticket issue of 2014 that he worked so hard to stop the emergence of Saraki as Senate President in a move he considered as retaliatory.\n\nSaraki also stated that after he was elected Senate President, Tinubu maintained an adversarial position against the eighth National Assembly, initiated covert and overt measures aimed at undermining the federal legislature, and set the executive against the legislature.\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal declared that it was very difficult supporting a Yoruba person in national politics, following Tinubu\u2019s outburst.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have a way of making you regret your support because they eventually make you seem like a traitor to your own people. Now all these comments about Bola\u2019s Yoruba presidency and his support of Buhari without which Buhari would not have been president is bullshit.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one whose support made a difference. There were many others from all around the country and they are not bragging about it. You may wish to know that all of us Buhari supporters are shocked and pissed off by Bola\u2019s speech on this occasion. It is unlike him.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF said Tinubu\u2019s speech was massively trending in the North \u201cand being given a negative connotation as you can well imagine.\u201d\n\nHe said he first read it on an Adamawa group platform \u201cand the anger is palpable and all round.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Tinubu win Monday\u2019s APC primaries without Northern support? You would think Yorubas will resist the temptation of joining in the northerners-bashing game at this very critical time \u2013 the primary election is only three days away. It is unfortunate that Bola himself chose to join in this bashing game \u2013 choosing to speak in the Yoruba language and in Yoruba land in a manner that seems to denigrate Buhari. I could vividly imagine the discomfort of all the northerners sitting beside him on that podium.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be the Abiola saga being replayed. Abiola won the election with majority Northern votes but they took the brunt of the post-election protests that followed.\n\n\u201cJust survey all the people that are doing more meaningful practical things to enthrone Bola as president and you will find that almost all are northerners while his kinsmen engage themselves in social media activism and Northern bashing.\n\n\u201cWhen Yorubas vilify the North like this, our sense of fear and insecurity under a Yoruba presidency gets heightened and in the end, pushes us to rethink our support for not only Bola but any Yoruba as president for that matter. Please, do not join our opponents to destroy our chances of clinching Monday\u2019s primary elections.\u201d\n\nCourt Asked to Disqualify Tinubu\n\nSome members of the APC under the platform of the Gaskiya Youth Movement have dragged Tinubu to court over what it alleges as discrepancies in the academic qualifications submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in aide of his qualification for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Umar Iliyasu, Suleiman Baba, and Abubakar Adama, in the suit filed on June 2, 2022, are claiming that the educational history of Tinubu \u201cis not consistent with the earlier forms C.F. 001\u201d he filled in preparation for the Governorship election of Lagos State in the year 1999.\n\nOutside the academic issue, plaintiffs are also alleging discrepancies in the age as well as the indigeneship of the former Lagos State Governor and as such want the court to stop Tinubu from participating in the June 7 primary election from the selection of the APC\u2019s candidate in the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nThe APC, Tinubu, and INEC are 1st to 3rd defendants respectively in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/774/2022.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs are accusing the APC presidential aspirant of giving false information in contravention of the electoral laws and constitution.\n\nIn a 31 paragraph affidavit deposed to by one Miracle Udeaja in support of the suit, the plaintiffs submitted that \u201cThe 2nd defendant presented an incorrect educational history and inconsistent dates of birth in his forms and ought to be disqualified from seeking or contesting for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nPlaintiffs further submitted that any person seeking an elective position under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), who presents a false document is disqualified from that election or any subsequent elections\n\nAmongst the issues for determination are; \u201cwhether, upon the due consideration of Section 131 of the Constitution, section 84(3) of the Electoral Act 2022, Article 20(111) and (iv) of the Constitution of the APC and Articles 9, 13 and 17 of the guidelines for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 general election issued by the APC, the 2nd defendant can participate or contest in the primary election on the platform of the 1st defendant.\n\n\u201cGiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, whether the 1 st defendant can allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cWhether the 2nd defendant can participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\nPlaintiffs urged that where the court answers the above questions in the affirmative, then the following reliefs should be granted: A declaration that \u201cgiven the questionable educational background and date of birth of the 2nd defendant, amongst other questionable issues, the 1 st defendant cannot allow and/or permit the participation of the 2nd defendant in the primary election for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cA declaration that the 2nd defendant cannot participate by presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 general election scheduled to take place in June 2022.\n\n\u201cAn order disqualifying the 2nd defendant from contesting in the primary elections on the platform of the 1 st defendant scheduled for June 7, 2022, or any other day as may be fixed by the 1st defendant having not met the statutory requirements.\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd defendant from participating or presenting himself in any primary elections with any political party in Nigeria to be nominated as a presidential aspirant for the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
