The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha urged Nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it.\n\nShe explained that before foreign loans were contracted, very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation.\n\n\u201cBefore any foreign loan is contracted, including the issuance of Eurobond, they are approved by the Federal Executive Council and thereafter, the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAn important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cAn opinion is issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice before the agreements are signed.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due. Provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve disputes when they arise.\n\n\u201cThe first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a lender, in this case, China, would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute, including defaults,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe explained that the DMO maintained proper records of debts, provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service.\n\nShe pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nPresident of the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN), Most Rev. Dr Benebo Fubara-Manuel, says pursuing gender justice for women will be a game-changer in addressing the nation\u2019s challenges.\n\nFubara-Manuel said this in Abuja yesterday while speaking at a symposium on human rights advocacy for women and girls, organised by the Women Wing of the Council of Nigeria.\n\nHe said in spite of laws that guarantee the legal and human rights of all citizens, many Nigerian women still suffer various forms of injustice in society on the basis of their gender.\n\n\u201cMany women and girls struggle to survive in spite of their enormous legal and human rights. The systems of the world that have attempted to affirm their rights have not affirmed them fairly or even sufficiently.\n\n\u201cWomen are still struggling to be educated in many places. They are still being abused by their parents and uncles, and their pastors are telling them not to wash their dirty linen in public.\n\n\u201cThose who managed to cry out for help are being named unpatriotic or unsupportive of their families.\n\n\u201cTo say \u2018no\u2019 to all this is to pursue justice, and we would truly pursue justice when we affirm our own culpability in injustice. When we tell ourselves that we are part of the problem, then we are starting in the right place,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe, however, solicited the support of government and other stakeholders in promoting equal opportunity for women to drive national development, saying: \u201cWe cannot pursue justice alone. We need others to make it worthwhile. This is why we must always collaborate in unity towards this goal.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the National President Women Wing of Christian Council of Nigeria, Dr Mrs Juliana Uzoaku, faulted the vote by the Senate shooting down the Gender Equality Bill last Wednesday.\n\nAccording to her, the decision of the Senate was an assault on the collective rights of Nigerian women.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen you step down a Bill, it means that it is of less relevance to you. The Senate has shown us that issue of gender justice is not a priority even when we see rape and violence being perpetrated against women, their rights being trampled upon, widowhood practices, child and forced marriages and many other gender injustices increasing on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Ms Donna Bollinger, the World Council of Churches Ecumenical Staff to the United Nations, stressed the need to amplify the voices of women and girls, especially those who have suffered violence at the hands of extremists and bandits as a way to attract global attention to their plight.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

He said I should look for someone else and after my second term, we would think of the next step,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe added that Tinubu said after the election, Aregbesola would come to learn more about Osun and its politics.\n\n\u201cSo, he chose Sooko Adewoyin, an elderly and experienced person from Ile Ife who was introduced to him by Prince Peter Ogunleye as his deputy.\n\n\u201cAt the appointed time, Rauf indeed came to Osun and he proved equal to the task, becoming the first Governor of Osun State to spend full two terms,\u201d he said.",

Habila Zakaria.\n\nThe FOC said that the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Adm. Awwal Gambo, would continue to provide and ensure a conducive environment for the maritime sector to flourish in the country.\n\n\u201cI assure you that the CNS will continue to leverage on all factors of national recreation, technology, training, teamwork and synergy to improve the services of the Nigerian Navy.\n\n\u201cThis will re-energise the Nigerian Navy and enhance her as a well-motivated naval force in the discharge of her constitutional mandate.\n\n\u201cThis has been the CNS mantra and we, in the Lagos area will ensure that the maritime environment is secured for economic activities to thrive,\u201d Gbassa said.\n\nHe urged military personnel to reflect on the expectations of the maritime stakeholders and brace-up to whatever sacrifice they may be called upon to make in ensuring safety of the maritime environment.\n\nThe FOC said that the Ceremonial Sunset was an age old naval tradition often done as part of the formalities to bring the activities of the year to a close.\n\n\u201cAlthough largely a regimental display, it is often tempered with a mien of social context where we invite dignitaries to a cocktail.\n\n\u201cThe event has been arranged with cordiality while observing the COVID-19 protocols,\u201d Gbassa said.\n\nAlso Rear Admiral Monday Unurhiere, the Special Guest of Honour at the 2021 Nigerian Navy Ceremonial Sunset, called on Nigerians to be more committed to the progress and well-being of the nation, by contributing their quotas to her development.\n\nAdmiral Unurhiere reminded guests at the occasion that each person has something within them to contribute for the betterment of the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we relax and enjoy the yuletide season in the build-up to 2022, let us spare thoughts for what we individually and corporately will do to enhance Nigeria\u2019s prosperity and by extension humanity.\n\n\u201cWe must all be reminded that there is none of us that do not have something to offer.

          "title": "Popular Ifa priest, Yemi Elebuibon: Blood money ritual a hoax",
          "text": "Prominent Ifa priest, Chief Ifayemi Elebuibon, has debunked the belief by some Nigerians that using human blood and body parts could generate wealth.\n\nIn an interview with LATEEF DADA in Osogbo, Osun State capital, Elebuibon said the belief was a hoax, insisting that no genuine traditional priest would indulge in such satanic enterprise.\n\nChief Elebuibon, Araba-Awo of Osogboland is an artist, author and international scholar-in-residence at San Francisco State University in California, United States, where he teaches African Traditional religion and philosophy. He is the founder of Ancient Philosophy International, Osogbo, Osun State, a centre dedicated to teaching African traditional religion and performing arts.\n\nThe well-travelled priest also pooh-poohed the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, over the latter\u2019s alleged attacks on traditionalists in the South-West.\n\nThe priest also spoke on the travails of Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) even as he explained why traditionalists have not been helping government in tackling banditry, kidnapping and other security challenges in the country.\n\nIt has been observed that governments at both federal and state levels hardly deal with traditionalists officially. Are you happy with that?\n\nIt is true, particularly the Federal Government. They don\u2019t support us. Whenever we try to discuss with them, they usually give excuses that we have different groups and they don\u2019t want to be seen as giving priority to one group. But the Yoruba speaking states should be the ones to promote our culture and religion. Former governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, declared a public holiday for Isese Day (Tradition Day) The holiday should spread to Ekiti, Lagos, Kwara, Oyo and those of us speaking the same language.\n\nOluwo of Iwo, a first-class traditional ruler in Osun State, says Yoruba Obas should stop worshipping Orisa or idols, and that deities are under the Oba. He says the deities being worshipped in Yorubaland are powerless. What\u2019s your take?\n\nWe noticed that his knowledge is not full enough. He lacks orientation as a king. A king that passed through royal processes and observed all the requisite preparation will not behave as he behaves and will not talk as he talks. He didn\u2019t have good foundation as a king. There is no king in Yorubaland that will say the oracle is meaningless. It was Ifa that founded each town. The town he is presiding over was founded by Obara Otua while Idileke founded Osogbo. No king can say Ifa is meaningless. It is Ifa that prescribes who will be king. How will a king say he is more than Ifa? He is saying rubbish. He\u2019s ignorant; his knowledge is not enough. If it is Quran alone that he reads, I advise him to look for one person that will teach him Ifa. He should read about past kings and see how each town was founded. But because of his one-way knowledge, any king that is a real Yoruba and not an illegitimate one, will not rubbish Ifa. There is nothing we can do without Ifa in Yorubaland. If we want to select kings, we will consult Ifa, if we want to build markets, it is Ifa, if we want to marry, we will ask Ifa. How will he now place a religion that was brought over the existing religion? It is like a tenant telling the landlord to vacate. That is why I said his knowledge is not enough. I advise him to be reading the Bible, the Quran and learn the Ifa Corpus.\n\nSome traditionalists also say there are antidotes against gunshots, against cutlasses, knives and so on. Do those things really work?\n\nThere is no hunter or combatant that will say there is no prevention against gunshots. Every tribe and country has its own knowledge inherited by its people. The Europeans have, the Russians have. We have our own in Yorubaland. What\u2019s the meaning of bulletproof? That\u2019s their own Ayeta. We also have our own. If you see a warrior dressed in our own bulletproof wear, you will notice that they put some things on the clothes. That is their own ayeta. What is happening to us is that we don\u2019t cherish our own, and our problem is religion. Both Christians and Muslims don\u2019t know the meaning of Orisa.\n\nSo what is the meaning of Orisa (deity)?\n\nEsu is a human being. Orunmila, Obatala, Sango, Mohammed and Jesus are human beings. Someone that was created specially is Orisa. If this is where Jesus was born, we will be calling him Orisa (deity). If this is where Mohammed was born, we will be calling him deity. What is the difference? If anybody says I should not worship a deity, he is saying I should not go to church or I should not go to the mosque. Whoever says his forefathers are fools is abusing his great grandfather.\n\nSome say the ayeta, the Yoruba native bullet proof can\u2019t stop bullets from a sophisticated gun like the AK 47. How true is that?\n\nWe have the Yoruba bullet proof against AK 47, and there is another one for local guns. It depends on the knowledge of it. There is another one that is bigger than all these, the one that is used to wave calamity away when it is coming. Some people have it, some don\u2019t. That does not mean it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nWith killer herders taking over roads and forests all over Nigeria, why can\u2019t Ifa tell us what to do to conquer insecurity in Nigeria?\n\nHave you consulted Ifa? The oracle only speaks on what they ask it. Herbalists don\u2019t just consult the oracle. You will never see a herbalist meeting you on the road and ask you to come and consult the oracle or tell you that this is what you ate last night. Ifa will not just talk if you don\u2019t consult it.\n\nWhat if the government calls you to find solution to the problem of insecurity? Would you oblige?\n\nBefore the new religion and culture, our fathers usually do atonement for the towns against calamity. They usually prepare powerful protection at the border of every town. If war enters a town, there is a way to tackle it. We have been doing this and those that know it are still there. But, if you don\u2019t go to them, they won\u2019t come to you.\n\nWe have many security agencies today, yet insecurity persists. What is the solution?\n\nWhat you should ask is, did government give hunters what they gave the Civil Defence and Police? Is the government paying the hunters the way they pay other security agents? If they do not support hunters, what do you expect?\n\nA major talk about traditionalists and their presumed powers centres around Sunday Adeyemo aka Igboho. He is believed to be a powerful traditionalist. Many have wondered why he was easily arrested by the security agents in Benin Republic, and why he has not disappeared from their prison if traditional powers are as potent?\n\nHis own case is different. If he recites incantations very well, the handcuffs will cut off on their own. There are many things like that, but religion has spoilt some things. We don\u2019t value those elders that have all the powerful things. Some of them have gone before we realise our folly.\n\nThere was a younger brother to my father who told me that he would give me something to swallow. The man usually turned to a bird. I didn\u2019t know, and I told my mother that my small father said he would give me something tomorrow. My mother did not talk. At night, we sat in the sitting room with that man and my mother started saying, \u2018nobody should turn my son to anything.\u2019 My mother was entering the room and coming out. She was saying, \u2018nobody should give my child anything to swallow.\u2019 About three days later, the man squeezed my ear, saying \u2018did I ask you to tell your mother? I grew old before I understood the reason my mother said he should not turn me to the way he was. The man did not have wife and had no child. Whenever he turned to a bird, it was my father that monitored and prevented children from throwing stone or catapults at him. If he had a wife and there was some misunderstanding, you know he was in trouble. Whenever we ere having Ogun festival, they would be shooting at the man and he would be dusting off the bullets. He was able to live long because he did not have a wife.\n\nCan we now blame Igboho\u2019s travails on exposure or women?\n\nThat is part of what I am saying. You will never see a powerful person living a flamboyant life and romancing with women anyhow. There is also the saying that an empty barrel makes the loudest noise. You will see powerful kings then, whenever their wives put their food down, she would first eat from it before the kings would eat that food. That is how we met it. It is for security. Who is doing that now?\n\nWe have many youths now going into what they call Yahoo Plus, which many claim involves blood rituals. It is believed that traditionalists and herbalists are the ones preparing the evil ritual for them. What\u2019s your take?\n\nFrom time immemorial, oogun (charms/spiritual powers) has been a great phenomenon among people of the world, but in the African continent there is a great belief in rituals and powers beyond disputations. Most times, when people discuss about money ritual (oogun owo), they always link it to the traditional African religion and portray it as a demonic religion that promotes human sacrifice and bloodshed. This is due to the years of brainwashing by the West and the numerous misconceptions about rituals and the African religion.\n\nAccording to the Webster New World Dictionary, Ritual means having the nature of or done as a rite. Ritualism is the observance of forms or rites. Therefore, what one keeps doing everyday is a ritual; it doesn\u2019t have to be spiritual. Unfortunately, what we see in our society today is quite alarming. The way our youths are on the pursuit of money by any means raises a big concern, yet some elders in the community also contribute to this problem. There is absolutely nothing wrong in money ritual but any money that one seeks or gets by the use of force or violence is totally wrong. The kind of money made from such violent acts is blood money (owo eje) and is impure in all ways, no matter the perspective.\n\nYoruba people are the ones who make oso or osole. There is nothing wrong with osole. There are many herbal medicines and spiritual works that give luck and prosperity to business people in their various occupations. It also enhances profit maximization.\n\nOso comes in various forms and has levels of intricacies. Some are used in the middle of the night while others require the person to wear special attire such as a complete white outfit (to signify purity) and stand out among all others. There is nothing harmful about this. It is one of the many practices of our ancestors that enable them live a more comfortable and enjoyable life.\n\nThe point that people often miss is that Os\u00f3 in the Yoruba language means wizard. A person who has become a wizard in a particular field or occupation has achieved the highest level of mastery and success. When a student excels and is incredibly brilliant, he/she is regarded as a book wizard. It is as simple as that.\n\nOne of the major problems we have today is that some people claim that the major ingredients that constitute an effective Os\u00f3le requires human body parts or requires one to take the life of another. This is totally false.\n\nThe true Yoruba babalawo or traditionalist do not engage in such horrific acts, because they consider life to be very precious and their main purpose of being a traditionalist is to save lives and not take them. However, over the years, our society has been infiltrated by certain groups from some other areas that have been known for such acts. They have lived among us for years and have mixed with us. This causes them to be mistaken for babalawo.\n\nThere have been many instances where Christians or Muslims have been caught with human body parts or arrested for killings with the purpose of enrichment and are portrayed by the media and the police as babalawo. This is totally wrong, Real babalawo do not kill or maim for the purpose of money. Since the inception of money, there have been various people who have attempted to amass great wealth without working hard and earning wealth but have chosen to get rich through bloodshed instead. They bought into the so-called blood money schemes, but these have always ended disastrously,\n\nWhat happened at a hotel in Ile-Ife recently has generated reactions\u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t want to comment about that, because the police are still investigating. What I can say is that we have had many infiltrations. It is very common to certain Tapa Islamic clerics from some places outside Yorubaland. But this has infiltrated into our culture.\n\nWhen we were young, there was one they usually did, and they would tell the person that if a hen picked four grains of maize, the person doing the money ritual would have money for four years. Those were Islamic clerics from a state outside Yorubaland. But as a result of intermarriage between those particular people, and us everything has been mixed up. If you see someone wearing white everyday, it is some ritual called Oso and there is nothing bad in it. Oso is what you do in excess. So, herbalists do kill rats, goats, birds or sheep. But they never kill human beings. Never!\n\nYou have been consistent as a traditional priest for many years, in spite of the decreasing popularity of traditional religion. Have you at any time considered changing your religion?\n\nTraditional religion has spread all over the world. There are many religions on earth; it is only that Islam, Christianity and Traditional Religions are popular. I have never thought of leaving my religion. The only thing that can make you have doubts about what you are doing is lack of knowledge about that thing. If someone tells me that what I\u2019m doing is not good and I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m doing what is right, I won\u2019t bother. There is no benefit you see from other religions that you will not see from traditionalists. There is no behaviour that you see from Christians or Muslims that traditionalists do not have. There is no lesson that the Bible or the Quran taught us that is not in Ifa Oracle. So, what is the problem? I have never at a time thought of leaving traditional religion.\n\nDo you have any of your children practising your religion or are they Christians and Muslims?\n\nAll my children practise my religion. One of them just celebrated Ifa festival and a popular musician was invited to play for people. I have children in Nigeria, London, those that are lawyers and so on. We all practise the same religion. None of them is a Christian or Muslim, except those that are female and are married to people in other religions. At times, women don\u2019t have any religion other than what their husband is practising. But, I do tell them that there is nobody that traditional religions does not benefit. Is it not Christians and Muslims that we consult the oracle for? They come to consult oracle and make sacrifice.\n\nWhen did you learn Ifa?\n\nI started learning it since I was four years old. My father started teaching me when I was four.\n\nYou didn\u2019t go to school at all?\n\nI didn\u2019t go to school. I studied at home. I learned how to read and write at home. I did a correspondence course at home. The whites that I worked with also helped me improve my reading and writing.\n\nLike how many countries have you visited as an Ifa priest?\n\nOnly God knows that. I have not been to Tokyo and I want to go. I had two programmes at Japan but the COVID-19 lockdown hindered the process. But talk of Yugoslavia, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil and so on, I have travelled to those countries. They usually invite me for lectures on Ifa.\n\nWho are those that invite you?\n\nUniversities do invite me. Some groups that have cultural organisations also do invite me.\n\nDo we have any Nigerian university that invites you for lectures?\n\nI am an associate staff of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, although they didn\u2019t give me a job. But abroad, I was a Professor and they gave me a big house. They pay me appropriately. They gave me office and some entitlements.\n\nWhy are Nigerian universities not treating traditionalists the way traditionalists are being treated by the universities abroad?\n\nThe British Colonial mentality will make Nigerian universities think that I don\u2019t have a PhD. I work with San Francisco State University. They didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t have a PhD. Some of my supervisors in academics are my students in tradition that they come to when it is time for oracle consultations and teaching. Our people here cannot do that. You see the Yoruba in particular, our major problem is that we have lost our tradition. We don\u2019t believe in our tradition.\n\nThe issue of COVID-19 that you mentioned, did the government invite you to consult oracle on the solution? And if they did, would you have proffered solutions?\n\nWell, they didn\u2019t. Pandemic is not a new thing. God gave us some good things like knowledge, culture, tradition and others. When the British came, they wrote it that Yorubas are brilliant among the tribes they have seen. We have a system of government before they brought their own and started giving kings money. It is the people that took care of kings before. They would bring pepper, yam, another person would bring maize and so on. They withdrew power from kings when they started giving them salaries. The person that is giving you salary, you will do whatever he asks you to do. That is why the kings can no longer command. We have thrown tradition away. If the Yoruba governors can come together, contribute meaningful amount every month and spend it on certain causes, we would have grown more than this. They said they should not bring cows, but where is our own? Also food. We have abandoned farming and we are saying food is expensive.\n\nAre the youths still learning ifa?\n\nThey are learning but not the way we learnt it. The youths of today are not patient. I thank God that my children are doing well.\n\nAre the Yoruba presidential aspirants coming to you for consultation?\n\nThe herbalist is a secret keeper. If anyone came to me, you will never hear it from me that the person came to me.",

          "title": "US Study: Omicron Markedly Resistant to Vaccines, Booster Shots",
          "text": "*Canada lifts travel ban on Nigeria, 9 other African countries\n\nOur correspondents\n\nA new study by Columbia University in the United States says the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is \u201cmarkedly resistant\u201d to existing vaccines and antibody treatments, and that even booster shots may provide only modest protection against infection.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of Canada\u2019s decision yesterday to lift the ban on foreign travellers from Nigeria and nine other African countries, over Omicron.\n\nThe draft study on Omicron resistance was led by renowned American researcher, Dr. David Ho, and early evidence suggests the lightning quick-spreading strain is likely to cause a massive wave of so-called breakthrough infections even among fully vaccinated people.\n\n\u201cWe found Omicron to be markedly resistant to neutralisation in individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralising activity against Omicron,\u201d says the study.\n\nThe study is still in the so-called \u201cpre-print\u201d stage, meaning it has not been reviewed by other experts or edited by any scientific journal. It was released last Wednesday by the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, which is now focused on fighting COVID-19.\n\nThe study says existing antibody therapies, like the monoclonal antibody cocktails that are credited with saving many lives during current and previous COVID-19 waves, appear to be mostly ineffective against Omicron.\n\nIt also noted that natural antibodies from previous infections are not effective in warding off Omicron, meaning people who have had COVID-19 in the past are virtually unprotected from reinfection in the coming Omicron wave.\n\nThe Omicron variant has now been detected in over 70 countries. It has a high number of mutations (32) in its spike protein, and preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection, when compared with other variants of concern.\n\nResearchers and scientists are intensifying their investigations to understand the transmissibility, severity and impact of the Omicron variant in relation to the available vaccines, diagnostics and treatment and whether it is driving the latest surge in COVID-19 infections.\n\nWorking with African governments to accelerate studies and bolster the response to the new variant, World Health Organization (WHO) is urging countries to sequence between 75 and 150 samples weekly.\n\n\u201cThe detection and timely reporting of the new variant by Botswana and South Africa has bought the world time. We have a window of opportunity but must act quickly and ramp up detection and prevention measures. Countries must adjust their COVID-19 response and stop a surge in cases from sweeping across Africa and possibly overwhelming already-stretched health facilities,\u201d said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\n\nThe emergence of Omicron is rattling countries around the globe and underlines the importance of pandemic preparedness \u2013 the focus of a special session of the World Health Assembly that wrapped up this week.\n\nCountries agreed to launch a global process to draft and negotiate a convention, agreement or other international instrument under the WHO Constitution to strengthen pandemic prevention preparedness and response.\n\nCanada Lifts Travel Ban on Nigeria, 9 Other African Countries\n\nMeanwhile, Canada announced yesterday the lifting of a ban on foreign travellers from Nigeria and nine other African countries.\n\nThe country also re-imposed testing, warning that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 risks quickly overwhelming hospitals.\n\nApart from Nigeria, the travel restriction on flights is also lifted on South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nCanadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos was quoted as announcing this at a news conference.\n\nHe said the lifting of the travel ban would take effect from 11:59 pm today.\n\nThe restriction had been announced last month \u201cto slow the arrival of Omicron in Canada and buy us some time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut with Omicron now spreading within Canada it is no longer needed,\u201d he added.\n\nPre-arrival negative PCR tests for all travellers would also be reinstated as of December 21, Duclos said, while repeating a government warning earlier this week that \u201cnow is not the time to travel.\u201d\n\nOfficials said laboratory tests have confirmed as at yesterday nearly 350 cases of the Omicron variant across Canada.\n\nThe total average daily COVID case count, meanwhile, has jumped by 45 per cent in the past week to about 5,000.\n\n\u201cIt is expected the sheer number of Omicron cases could inundate the health system in a very short period of time,\u201d said Chief Public Health Officer, Theresa Tam.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nIn what is evidently a battle for the control of FBN Holdings (FBNH), Remi Babalola yesterday resigned as Chairman, Board of Directors of the company, two days after FBNH confirmed significant investment by billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola.\n\nFBN Holdings is the parent company of First Bank of Nigeria.\n\nOn the same day, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that it had okayed the appointment of Alhaji Ahmad Abdullahi as non-executive Director of FBN Holding Plc and Chairman of the company to replace Babalola.\n\nAs at press time, it was not clear whether, Abdullahi was nominated by Otedola, who is now the single largest shareholder in the company.\n\nIndustry sources said FBNH had on Wednesday informed regulators about Otedola\u2019s new position as the single largest shareholder.\n\nLast week, Otedola acquired an additional 2.5 per cent in FBN Holdings Plc., becoming the single largest shareholder in the company.\n\nBased on this, the equity stake of Otedola is now 7.57 per cent of the issued shares capital of FBNH.\n\nIn a corporate filing on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) on Wednesday, FBN Holdings confirmed the deals.\n\nDespite his shareholding status, Otedola had said the move was purely an investment decision and not to become the chairman or hold any key position in the HoldCo.\n\n\u201cBeing the single largest shareholder doesn\u2019t mean I must necessarily hold a position in the bank. I believe in allowing competent people to run institutions in a professional manner and to the benefit of all the stakeholders,\u201d he had said.\n\nCBN Okays Abdullahi as New Chairman\n\nThe CBN yesterday okayed the appointment of Abdullahi as the new Chairman of FBNH to replace Balalola.\n\nIts Director of Corporate Communications, Osita Nwanisobi, disclosed in a statement that the bank had been duly notified of the resignation of Babalola, as Chairman of the company against the backdrop of contest by some significant shareholders for control of the financial institution.\n\nWhile congratulating Abdullahi on his appointment, the CBN described Babalola\u2019s resignation as the Chairman of the company as highly regrettable, especially given the fact that CBN\u2019s regulatory interventions had made positive impact and increased attractiveness of the company to both local and foreign investors.\n\nNotwithstanding the recent development, he said the CBN acknowledged the measured achievements recorded by the company under Babalola\u2019s watch, and thanked him for his service, even as the CBN wished him well in his future endeavours.\n\nAccording to Nwanisobi, the regulatory measures taken by the CBN were yielding the expected results in terms of overhaul of corporate governance practices, restoration of confidence in the bank\u2019s brand, increased transparency and due process in transactions as well as improved financial performance.\n\nIn line with its statutory mandate, the CBN spokesman said the CBN remained committed to ensuring transparent governance practices at the bank and the continued independence of the chairman and other persons holding key governance positions.\n\nGiven the systemic importance of First Bank owing to its historical significance, balance sheet size, large customer base and high level of interconnectedness with other financial service providers, the CBN had in April 2021, taken decisive regulatory action to address corporate governance infractions at the bank leading to the removal of the board of First Bank Ltd and FBN Holdco Plc and appointment of a new board.\n\nAbdullahi is an economist and thorough-bred professional with long years of experience in the academia, banking supervision and financial regulation, retiring as Director of Banking Supervision, CBN in February 2020.\n\nAn expert in bank crisis resolution, he also serves on the boards of the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), FMDQ, NDIC and AMCON.\n\nBabalola was appointed chairman, April 29, 2021, and had barely spent one year.\n\nIn a parting mail yesterday, Babalola wrote: \u201cMy esteemed Co-Directors of FirstBank, the over 7-months journey since my appointment by the CBN to the Board of the Holdings Company has been a mix of hard work, sacrifices, battles and consensus building, all aimed at returning the institution to the path of stability and sustainable growth. Though, the assigned mandate has been daunting, we have within the short period successfully reinstated confidence in the institution, overhauled its corporate governance and introduced openness and due process in all transactions.\n\n\u201cHowever, after deep reflection on recent developments relative to my personal values, I resigned my appointment as a Non-Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of FBN Holdings with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cI thank you for your unflinching support, co-operation and valuable contributions during my short leadership. I wish you the very best as you soldier on.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "As the year gradually runs to an end, from all indications, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho will spend the festive season in jail, barring any last-minute development.\n\nAloy Ejimakor, special counsel for Kanu on Friday told SaharaReporters it was his wish that his client does not spend Christmas in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS), but added that there is no court case again this year.\n\nThe lawyer said he was waiting for Abia State High Court to fix a date to continue hearing of Kanu\u2019s case. A lawsuit demanding Kanu's fundamental human rights had been instituted at the court.\n\nJustice Benson Anya of the Abia court had said in the last court proceedings on December 10 that the parties will receive notice on the date the court will render its judgment.\n\nKanu is facing charges of treasonable felony levelled against him by the Nigerian government, but Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had adjourned his case till next year, January 18.\n\nEjimakor said, \"It is my hope as his lawyer that he will not spend Christmas in detention, but we don't have any court case this year again.\n\n\"The Abuja case is next year January 18, while the Umuahia has been concluded but we have to wait for when they will call us for judgment.\"\n\nSimilarly, Igboho, who was arrested by the Republic of Benin authorities at the Cotonou Airport on July 19, 2021, has since been in a detention facility in the neighbouring country.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters on Thursday, Pelumi Olajengbesi, one of the activist's counsel said the chances of getting Igboho out of prison in 2021 is very slim.\n\nHe, however, does not rule out the possibility of Igboho's release as he added that efforts were being made to secure his release.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the hope of getting him released this year is still very slim. There are diplomatic consultations going on in respect of that because as you know, Igboho in the eyes of the law is a very free person, he has committed no crime.\n\n\u201cWe know he's being held against his will. He's a prisoner of conscience and so we believe that he will be out soon but I can't guarantee he will be out before the end of this year. There are lots of diplomatic discussions going on in that regard.\u201d\n\nConcerning the health of the agitator which had sometime ago been reportedly failing, Olanengbesi stated, \u201cI can tell you right now that Chief Sunday Igboho is hale and hearty, very motivated, a very strong person. If you know him very closely, you will know he is a very courageous person. We continue to pray that God gives him more strength to remain focused.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported efforts made by some major pro-Yoruba bodies to get Igboho out of jail, including holding protests to register their displeasure at his continued detention.\n\nIn November, Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua announced that it had begun the movement to secure the release of Igboho.\n\nThe group disclosed this during the inauguration of its Elders Advisory Council in Ibadan.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Agbekoya Solidarity Movement of Nigeria, representing the interest of farmers in Ibadan, Oyo State, took to the streets to call for the immediate release of the activist.\n\nThe protesters started the protest from Mapo Hall in Ibadan, carrying placards boldly demanding the release of Igboho who they claimed was fighting for their rights.\n\nThe group had approached the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, with a letter stating their demands.\n\n\n\nThey requested that the king present the letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on their behalf.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian-American philanthropist, Toyin Dawodu urged the Benin Republic government to immediately release Igboho from detention.\n\nDawodu, in a statement, warned that the Beninese government must ensure the adequate release of the activist within seven days or \u201cface serious consequences of the nature of an economic embargo that as a country, it may never recover from, in a very long time.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their affiliate commission. They earn 0.4% on withdrawals and \u20a67 on transactions.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting 70% active POS terminal performance management system for cluster managers. That is, for every 10 terminals given, at least 7 must be doing transaction values exceeding certain amounts. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance. Failing cluster managers can\u2019t get additional terminals, and this means their multi-level earnings on their agent network caps. No one wants that. So they\u2019d have to retrieve the non-performing terminals and give them to better agents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want people who use our terminals only when they are broke. It affects your cluster manager\u2019s appraisal, which in turn affects your state co-ordinator and regional manager\u2019s appraisal. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards.

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\n\nA few weeks ago, we started a discussion on The Next Frontier. Since then, we\u2019ve explored The Next Frontier as it relates to edtech and fintech. This week, we\u2019re doing something a bit different.\n\nDrawing from previous discussions, we will look at four future developments in tech and what they could mean for you either as a student, startup founder, entrepreneur, or policymaker.\n\nAI and more data applications in edtech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Pixabay on Pexels\n\nThere have been considerable developments in Africa\u2019s edtech space, from remote learning to self-paced learning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the future, the application of artificial intelligence and proper data management would be groundbreaking. In the case of AI, it would be improving learning efficiency for students and teachers.\n\nOne of the challenges of traditional education is the inability to tailor teaching to the needs of students and AI can help with that through personalised learning.\n\nSo this could mean that while there may be several students in a class, they would all be taught at different levels and tested on different subjects.\n\nThe other development would be in the use of data. As more students use edtech solutions, a lot of data would be gotten that could also help in providing better learning outcomes.\n\nEven more interesting is that these developments would not be beneficial to students alone. Teachers would be able to develop curriculums that draw on the students\u2019 strengths.\n\nRepetitive and administrative tasks would also be cut down or eliminated using AI.\n\nAPI healthtech startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\nThe fintech industry has benefited a great deal from the presence of API fintech startups as they have eased interoperability. The same looks set to be done for the healthtech space.\n\nCurrently, there are no African startups providing healthtech startups with an API. Consequently, data obtained exists in silos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPI startups could, therefore, be a game-changer. Imagine for a moment that you are a patient who has been using a healthtech provider but now needs to switch to another for some reason.\n\nWithout API startups, the process of getting your medical history has to begin afresh, but with an API startup, all that information could be gotten in seconds.\n\nIn addition, healthtech APIs mean that startups no longer have to build all the solutions they need but instead focus on the areas in which they excel.\n\nCompanies investing in companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem matures, one trend that Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, believes could become commonplace is companies investing in companies.\n\nAlready, we\u2019re seeing some form of it with Interswitch\u2019s investment in Okhi and Flutterwave\u2019s investment in CinetPay.\n\nWhat this would do is help companies consolidate their efforts. So rather than have several companies in a space but only slightly moving the needle, the resources and skills can be combined to go after a larger market.\n\nUsing the fintech industry as an example, it could mean that more financially excluded people get access to financial services.\n\nCompanies investing in companies would also mean that the smaller startup could leverage the assets and experience of the larger startup to build more efficient services and attract other investors.\n\nContactless cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, you will be familiar with contactless cards. You transfer money to it and use it to pay your bus fares.\n\nNow, imagine your financial service provider issuing such a card. You\u2019d no longer be bothered about leaving the house without cash or your ATM card.\n\nYou could pay for groceries or dates without using cash or punching in your ATM card PIN. It is also a safer option for users as it reduces the chances of being robbed. For business owners, it also improves the customer experience while protecting against fraud.\n\nIf you were not aware, The next frontier is also the theme for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nHolding on January 22, 2022, it will feature startup competitions and exhibitions in addition to conversations on The next frontier. We would love to have you there, so if you have not registered, follow this link to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries that can now boast a data protection law.\n\nLike the second instalment in this series, a tweet spurred this article. This tweet by tweeter, @RangMberi intrigued me for two reasons.\n\nNever having followed the Zimbabwean scene, it was nice to see. However, the tweet\u2019s contents were of more interest to me.\n\nFrom the screenshots Mberi shared, several acts such as revenge pornography, child pornography, and taking pictures of people\u2019s genitalia without their consent have become illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a data protection act, these were some intriguing provisions.\n\nA walk down memory lane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nBefore the current Act, Zimbabwe\u2019s laws have made provisions \u2014 albeit in a fragmented manner \u2014 for data protection and privacy.\n\nThe Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act dealt more with the collection, protection, and retention of personal information held by public officers. Other laws included the Consumer Protection Act, Census and Statistics Act, and the Interception of Communication Act, among others.\n\nBut this new law has been in the works for a while as well. First gazetted in May 2020 as the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill, it has since undergone some changes.\n\nInitially, The Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill was to cover all things incidental to Cybercrime and Data Protection. Essentially a mash-up of two different but related fields.\n\nBut a lot of people weren\u2019t having that. Transparency International complained that it was a human rights lawsuit waiting to happen \u2014 especially regarding government spying and stifling freedom of speech. Other persons decried the bill as well.\n\nIn July 2020, Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees released a report asking that both fields be separated and an independent body be set up, among other recommendations.\n\nAnd it appears Parliament may have listened, somewhat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nThe Data Protection Act, as it is known now, is styled after the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) model law on data protection.\n\nIt provides for most of what you\u2019d expect from a data protection law; things like data rights of the data subject, what personal information is, and what sensitive information is, among others.\n\nIt provides extensively for consent \u2014 very important \u2014 and it introduces the vital issue of representation of infants and persons that are mentally, legally, or physically incapacitated by their parents and guardians.\n\nIt also explains other important provisions and duties of the data controller and processor, which we have touched on in previous articles.\n\nThe Act also establishes a Data Protection Authority (DPA), but this is where it gets a bit tricky. The DPA appointed in this case is an existing authority called the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ).\n\nPOTRAZ is Zimbabwe\u2019s telecommunications sector regulator, already saddled with responsibilities in that regard. Adding this to that is an interesting move, especially considering all of the duties assigned to them under this new law.\n\n\u201cI think they are going to be saddled with too much administrative authority. Because imagine having to handle all these breaches that will come within 48 hours. I don\u2019t know yet how adequately prepared they are for this.\n\n\u201cI tried to put together the duties of the DPA, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 resource-wise \u2014 whether they\u2019d be able to achieve all of that,\u201d Nellie Tiyango, a Zimbabwean lawyer, tells me.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the fact that POTRAZ already has some experience on the data collection and protection front.\n\n\u201cIt should have been because POTRAZ was already collecting data. Because that\u2019s where our telecoms as well fall under in terms of picking up sensitive information. We\u2019ve got the Interception of Communication Act, and I think POTRAZ was in charge of that. The rationale could have been that they already have a lot of data. And it might be easier than starting afresh.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the new act was renamed the Data Protection Act instead of the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Act.\n\nHowever, after comparing the previous bill and the current Act, I found that it was merely rearranged to have all the parts touching on data protection at the beginning and the chapters touching on cybersecurity at the end.\n\nI worried that this could also create a duplication of laws and expressed this to Tiyango. But she had a differing opinion.\n\n\u201cData and cyber go hand-in-hand. There needed to be something that speaks to the issue of cybersecurity from a data perspective, which is what has been done. And I\u2019m sure [that] when we get the Cybersecurity law we will be able to see whether there\u2019s a duplication. I don\u2019t think that this causes any confusion. It\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Act does not mention notifying a data subject where there is a breach of their data. So, say Peter, a Zimbabwean who uses a fintech app for sending money, has his data stolen by someone who hacked into the company\u2019s servers, it appears he might never find out that his data has been stolen.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 the first comprehensive data protection law \u2014 provides for this. For some reason, Nigeria\u2019s National Data Protection Regulation has no such provision.\n\nThere are also issues of cross-border transfer of information between countries within and outside the SADC.\n\nFor instance, say you are conducting a cross-border transfer of funds, your data is flying over several countries, and the platform you are using has to ensure that the receiving platform has adequate resources in place to protect your data. If it doesn\u2019t, then your data should not be transferred.\n\nTiyango is interested in how this would play out, especially in scenarios where data is transferred to a non-SADC country.\n\nThe tech ecosystem and data protection\n\nAccording to Tiyango, \u201cThe Act aims to create a technology-driven business environment, encourage technological development, and the lawful use of technology.\u201d\n\nFrom what she tells me, companies like electronic communications networks or access providers, data collection and analytics techs, fintechs, mobile service providers, payment platforms, Internet service providers, satellite television service providers, and health services, including laboratories and testing techs, would have to comply.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nThe Zimbabwean Act is fresh out of the oven and needs time to cool before we can fully dissect all of the possible scenarios that could occur here.\n\nWill POTRAZ be able to handle all of its duties? Will there be a marked difference between the Data Protection Act and a possible Cybercrimes bill? Most of all, how would all of this affect the data rights of Zimbabweans?\n\nThis is a developing story, and we\u2019ll be bringing more on this as we get more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cUber-like platform for ambulances\u201d reechoed in the room, as HELP, an acronym for Health Emergency Linkage Portal, announced the launch of its GPS based mobile application and emergency healthcare hotline on October 5, 2021.\n\nThe healthtech and logistics company is on a mission to provide quality health care emergency services via a mobile application that allows you to order for an ambulance in case of an emergency, or schedule ahead of a medical appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProper and affordable health care is a fundamental human right. Sadly, in most developing countries like Nigeria, good healthcare is a privilege and accessing medical facilities can be an onerous task. The healthcare sector in the country is crippled with challenges like sluggish response to emergency cases, poor health infrastructure, low number of health workers, amongst other limitations. Deji Faborode, Co-founder and CEO of HELP, says this is the gap they are trying to bridge, one step at a time.\n\n\u201cA lot can be done and we\u2019re still scratching the surface of healthcare solutions in Nigeria. Things are not working as they should as a result of misaligned objectives. Our people are scared for their lives, because what happens in the case of a health emergency? Existing emergency structures don\u2019t meet the demand. This is what brought the vision for HELP. One of the gaps we\u2019re hoping to bridge is the hopelessness in emergency situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe goes further to add that the big picture is creating interconnected systems to complement the existing ones, in order to have a fully working and unified body of ambulance service providers.\n\nDeji Faborode (CEO), Yewande Alebiosu (COO), Victor Iwenya (CTO) and Tomiwa Ogunbona (CPO) birthed the idea to leverage technology in enhancing interconnectedness, building a collaborative healthcare ecosystem, and breaking the silos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 23 months later, the HELP journey to improve access to emergency care has kicked off.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe HELP mobile app is currently available for Android users on the Play Store and is soon to be available on the App Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELP website\n\nIndividuals or corporate bodies sign up, create an account, receive an OTP to confirm registration, and can search for and access ambulances nearest to them. There is also a Healthcare facility navigator which serves as a directory of hospitals and pharmacies closest to the user\u2019s geographical location.\n\nThere are two levels of external partners at HELP, Service Partners and Client Partners. Service partners on the HELP platform include hospitals, health facilities, and private ambulance owners in the country. Client partners include Health Maintenance Organisations(HMO) and Corporate organisations who enroll their members.\n\nThe Client partners\u2019 subscription plan comes in three tiers, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Each varies with the size of the ambulance being ordered and the equipment available for the service needed. Every ambulance type has a base price but prices vary based on distance covered and time spent.\n\nEach user has a unique wallet on the app created for making payments. This cuts out the hurdle of having to re-enter financial information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HELP app has a feature that allows you to fill in the details of the emergency, to provide adequate information to the paramedics present in the ambulance. The HELP app comes with a feature that allows one to share details like driver\u2019s information, trip history, and the hospital sending the ambulance, with their loved ones. Due to the geo mapping system integrated on the app, routes taken can be tracked and recorded.\n\nBeyond an application, HELP has a hotline, 0-700-HELPSTATION, for cases where there is inability to access mobile networks in an emergency situation. Interestingly, a random person can access the HELP service with the code.\n\nAs the floor opened for comments, some members of the audience shared stories of having lost loved ones as a result of delayed responses to emergency calls and lack of medical assistance in crisis situations.

          "title": "Recharge card sellers struggle to survive as buyers move online",
          "text": "In 2010, Nonso Onyeka, a recharge card seller would be able to make up to N150,000 in revenue because the digital revolution powered by deep mobile penetration was just about taking off. People depended on him to sell physical recharge cards to stay in touch with their loved ones or conduct their businesses.\n\nToday, the rise of mobile payment which allows Nigerians to buy and sell almost anything online means that sellers like Onyeka cannot depend on physical recharge cards to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI make N10 on a N200 recharge voucher and less depending on the value of the voucher. I had to add provisions and snacks to support myself as the recharge card business started slowing down,\u201d he told BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to Nonso who has been in the business for over seventeen years, they used to be over forty selling airtime at Apapa Barracks, however, they are now about six.\n\nThe adoption of the digital method of recharging phones has led to a huge reduction in the sales of recharge vouchers by airtime vendors, leading to some quitting while others add other ventures to their recharge card business.\n\nTo move with the digital trends of recharging airtime, Nonso had decided to get a PoS. However, he has been unable to get one promised to him for about five months.\n\nRead more Illegal betting markets yield $1.7tr revenue annuallY\n\nAs a result of convenience, people now adopt the digital form of buying airtime compared to some years back when Nigerians had to buy scratch cards and paper cards to credit their phones. This is done via various channels such as Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Bank apps, ATM, and POS.\n\nFor Mama Chichi who has been in the business for over ten years, her own story is different. She says the business is still going well as she gets a lot of Customers who buy recharge cards from her.\n\nHowever, she stated that one of the challenges she faces with the recharge card business is, sometimes when a customer buys the airtime which is on paper, they recharge it and get an error code which says \u201cthe airtime has been previously used\u201d, after which she will have to refund the customer.\n\nIn a phone interview with Olugbenga Hammed, Manager, Go-To-Market, MTN Nigeria, 53 percent of airtime revenue comes from digital channels, while 47 percent comes from paper recharge cards.\n\nThis shows that the leading telecommunication company, MTN, has more customers recharging their phones via digital channels compared to paper recharge cards.\n\nAccording to Hammed, the paper recharge card attracts more cost for the company compared to the digital form of recharging. These costs include printing, distribution, among others. This is one of the reasons digital channels are more profitable for the company compared to paper recharge cards.\n\nOlusola Teniola, Vice President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) said the country has quite a number of subscribers making use of alternative channels to recharge because of convenience.\n\nAccording to Teniola, \u201cThe adoption of the digital form of recharging can be seen more in major cities in the country, such as Abuja, Lagos, Port-Harcourt, Kano because these states have the highest population in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUsing Lagos for example, the UN-Habitat and international development agencies estimate the Lagos state population to be over 24 million population as of 2018. This population covers the population of five other states in the country. Kano which is the second-highest has over 16 million and Oyo state which has over 15 million. While in the remaining 32 states, there is a larger percentage making use of paper recharge vouchers.\n\nKanayo, who was sitting underneath a Recharge card seller\u2019s umbrella, told BusinessDay that he prefers to recharge online than buy the recharge card (on paper) due to the convenience that comes with it.\n\n\u201cI prefer to buy on my phone through my bank because at that moment I won\u2019t feel that I\u2019m spending my money to buy airtime and some other times I don\u2019t have cash, so it\u2019s easy to just buy directly from the bank,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "What to look out for in an artist",
          "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re an artist when you say you are. And you\u2019re a good artist when you make somebody else experience or feel something deep or unexpected.\u201d \u2014 Amanda Palmer\n\nArt is an expression or a means by which one can apply imagination and creative skill in a visual form. It would certainly be out of place to criticise anyone who calls her/himself an Artist. Anyone is an artist if (s)he says what they create is art, be it a painting, a woodwork, a sculpture, a photograph, or performing art. However, just by self proclamation, or being called an Artist by others does not translate to mean that such an artist is considered good or great.\n\nThe latter part of Amanda Palmer\u2019s quote aptly captures it all; \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026a good artist when you make somebody else experience or feel something deep or unexpected.\u201d One can recognise a good or great artist by how her/his art makes them feel. A great artist will by means of her/his art evoke emotions in you. Through its complexity or simplicity, or whatever form (s)he employs, a great artist will use her/his art to communicate a message to you in an effortless manner.\n\nHowever, should a good or great artist be measured only by how her/his art makes one feel? Absolutely not. There are other things that make up the secret sauce of what makes an artist good or great. Here are 5 qualities to look out for in an artist you\u2019re courting/looking to collect.\n\nThe Artist\u2019s Background\n\nWhile this is not a one size fits all as some artists are self taught, attendance at a formal and good art school is very relevant. This is because it is indicative that an artist has developed and is deeply invested in her/his creative passion, and so knows the ins and outs of the craft. Dig a little deeper and you would find that a lot of great artists today and in time\u2019s past, began making art at a very young age and developed their craft during art school. An artist\u2019s background forms her/his perception, her/his perception affects her/his creativity, her/his creativity defines her/his technique and style, which then defines the quality of work and messaging. When put together, these elements create an aura around the artist and her/his work is effortlessly formed. Truth be told, this aura is not necessarily taught in school. It resides in the heart and soul of the artist. A formal art school enables an artist to have the ability not only to paint with her/his hands, but with the heart. When an artist reaches this point, it shows that (s)he has reached the height of her/his creativity and has mastered that blend of knowing the craft and infusing soul into every piece.\n\nThe Authenticity of the Art\n\nAnyone can make a beautiful painting. Not everyone can put their soul into it. The style, complexity or simplicity, the medium, the narrative, all contribute to what makes great art. A piece of art needs to connect with the viewer and the viewer, the art. An Artist who can make art that leaves people asking questions, teaching them something, or showing them something that they didn\u2019t know they knew, is someone to look out for. The artist will employ the use of textures, rhythms, detailing, and repetition in creating her/his art to successfully reach the hearts of the audience. Oftentimes, an artist\u2019s greatest works come from being challenged in life, be it in finances, time, concept, or materials. An artist\u2019s ability to create art even abstractly, in such a way that it\u2019s artistic narrative tells a story that pulls the viewer inwards to wonder what was going on in the artist\u2019s mind, is a great catch.\n\nThe Collecting Community\n\nThis community includes, but not limited to, museums, curators, art critics, galleries, and institutions. The collecting community\u2019s demand and views on the artist is often a good determinant of an artist\u2019s value and appreciation. The community can stir up a craze for an artist. When the community finds a particular artist striking, it\u2019s worth looking into, and certainly worth considering for collecting. The community thrives when the arts and artists are thriving.\n\nThe Sales\n\nWho did (s)he do her/his tutelage under? Who is representing the artist? Who\u2019s collecting the artist? What\u2019s the current market value of the artist? Where has (s)he exhibited? How many solos and group exhibitions has (s)he done? Did (s)he sell out? The current market value of an artist can in many ways foretell how good or great this artist may become. If there is a high\n\ndemand for the artist\u2019s works, and the market justifies the value placed on her/his art, then that\u2019s an artist to keep close watch of and to collect.\n\nRead also: Mega products fashion expo begins in Aba\n\nThe Consistency of the Creation\n\nA notable quality is consistency. A serious artist will for whatever reason never stop making art. Consistency in practice, comes with compelling passion and will be evident in what is created. In consistency, the collecting community and patrons of the art should be able to tell which art belongs to what artist. This will be visibly evident because the said artist\u2019s personal voice will transcend into how (s)he visually expresses thoughts, feelings, concepts, narrative, positions. This differentiates a contending artist from others who may tend to dabble around inconsistent styles.\n\nArt Index Top 5 monthly \u2013 April 2021\n\nArt Index Africa\u2019s jury presents Art Index top 5; a showdown of the top 5 well researched and curated art pieces every collector should want to purchase based on strong technique, message, style, and medium.\n\nArtist: Oladimeji Alabi | Title: Beyond thoughts and theories 1 | Medium: Acrylic on textured canvas | Dimension: 24\u201d x 21\u201d ea. | Year: 2020 | Estimate: $1500 \u2013 $1670 | Status: Available\n\nArtist: Abinoro Akporode Collins | Title: The warrior queen | Medium: Stain steel spoons | Dimension: 85\u201d x 44\u201d x 34\u201d | Year: 2020 | Estimate: $16,000 \u2013 $17,500 | Status: Available\n\nArtist: Bankole Olabode | Title: E go better | Medium: Oil on canvas | Dimension: 2ft x 2ft | Year: 2021 | Estimate: $1,400 \u2013 $1,600 | Status: Available\n\nArtist: Dare Adenuga | Title: Panic Landing | Medium: Rope sculpture on terrazzo base | Dimension: H-51\u2033, L-30\u2033, B-20. stool:- H-20\u201d, L-30\u2033 B-20\u201d | Year: 2020 | Estimate: $2,200 \u2013 $3,000 | Status: Available\n\nArtist: Victor Ehikhamenor | Title: Cardinal Ifada | Medium: Mixed media | Dimension: 67\u201d x 86\u201d | Year: 2017 \u2013 2019 | Available on request\n\nIn Conclusion, art should be enjoyed by everyone in whatever form it comes in. However, when collecting art, you\u2019re making a long term investment. It is therefore important to place the right bet on a potentially high yielding artist. At the very core, an artist\u2019s expressions of art should make you feel something. That is how to truly identify an artist that has \u201cstaying power\u201d.\n\nUntil next month,",

It is a delight for me and the people of Edo State that we are here to witness the beginning of another slide in our quest for making Edo great again.\n\n\u201cWe are blessed with the main resources required to make furniture, which is timber and it\u2019s available in our rain forests.

What we plan to do is to now use this model to build similar facilities in six of our technical colleges,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President charged MSMEs engaged in furniture production in Edo to take full advantage of the facility to boost productivity.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThis is a priority of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration; as we all know, they are the engine of growth for the economy.\n\n\u201cThis facility, as we have seen already, is equipped with state-of-the-art machines and equipment, which at full capacity can produce about 250 furniture items daily, including doors, tables, dining tables and cabinets.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo continued: \u201cIt is equally notable that the Edo State Government is thinking of replicating the furniture manufacturing cluster across the 18 local government areas of the state and in some of the technical colleges.\n\n\u201cThere are plans that whenever we find any state willing to cooperate to provide this kind of facility, we are willing and ready to support. We are ready to support all other efforts of Governor Obaseki, either in this facility or any other MSME programme in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur MSMEs partners will ensure that final products from here meet global standards and are exported to the rest of the world,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, laying the foundation for the Edo Tech Park, the Vice President said the government will continue to play the role of a regulator in the tech space.\n\nIn response, Obaseki said, \u201cLet me thank you for bringing to our consciousness the fact that we could be a real digital hub; you did this more than three years ago. You gave us the first innovation hub in the South-South of Nigeria. That mustard seed you sowed is what you saw at the take-off campus of the Edo Tech Park.\n\n\u201cThat seed is what has brought us here this afternoon and it\u2019s being germinated to reflect where we want to be as a people. It is all about technology, and as government, we want to align the future of our children in Edo with the reality on the ground.\u201d\n\nSoliciting support and partnership with the federal government, Obaseki added, \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened without your support.

          "text": "Please, this is a humble appeal directed to the concerned authorities, requesting that at least some form of consideration be shown to some competent and quality teachers, who would otherwise be referred to as \u201cunqualified,\u201d going strictly by their non-possession of the N.C.E/B.Ed./PGDE and other education-related qualifications, as well as their status of registration with the Teachers\u2019 Registration Council of Nigeria (T.R.C.N).\n\nGoing by this new policy on possession of only education-related qualifications by all schoolteachers, some pertinent questions arise in the minds of many, especially those who are likely to be affected by it. Such questions include:\n\nWould someone who currently works as a Subject Teacher in a primary or secondary school, for example, and who studied a course related to the subject he teaches, but only at the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) or Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree level, be required to forfeit his/her current teaching position, to be replaced by someone else who has an N.C.E, B.Ed., PGDE, or other education-related qualification in that subject area?\n\nWould people currently working as Teaching Assistants/Assistant Teachers/Classroom Assistants also be required to possess the education-related qualifications currently required of all schoolteachers? . . . etc.\n\nAlso, considering the high rate of unemployment in the country currently, will the removal of teachers from classrooms on the grounds that they do not possess education-related qualifications, not cause the already high level of unemployment in the country to rise? If this directive is implemented, many who entered into the teaching profession as \u2018apprentices,\u2019 by learning on the job, and who have, over the years, made significant progress in the teaching profession, who have become competent and quality teachers, and who have also developed a strong passion for the teaching profession, would be forced to exit the profession that they have come to love, with probably little or no alternative employment opportunities or sources of livelihood.\n\nIn addition, with regard to the effect of unemployment on people, psychologists find that among today\u2019s unemployed, psychiatric and psychological problems are increasing, as well as emotional instability, frustration, progressive apathy, and loss of self-respect. When a person with children to care for loses a job, it is a terrible personal tragedy. The world has collapsed around them. Security has evaporated. Today, in fact, some experts note the emergence of an \u201canticipatory anxiety\u201d related to the possibility of losing one\u2019s job. This anxiety can seriously affect family relations and can have even more tragic results, as recent suicides of unemployed persons may indicate. Furthermore, the difficulty of breaking into the labour market is among the probable causes of violence and social alienation of young people.\n\nIt should also be noted that many other factors contribute toward the low quality and falling standard of the educational system apart from the inadequate qualifications of some schoolteachers. These other factors include: the poor remuneration of teachers, the absence of functional and well equipped libraries in many public and private schools across the country, absence of modern teaching facilities, etc. In addition, the attitude of the students themselves, toward the success of their own education, also plays an important role, and should not be taken for granted.\n\nFor example, with regard to libraries, due to the absence of functional and well-equipped school libraries in many public and private schools across the country, students and teachers are ill-equipped with adequate educational materials and resources that could greatly contribute towards the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning in such schools.\n\nIn view of the above, some steps that could be considered as an alternative to the instant removal of \u201cunqualified\u201d or incompetent teachers from the classrooms, in my humble opinion/suggestion, could include the other option of administering competence-based tests for these supposedly \u201cunqualified\u201d teachers, regardless of the educational qualifications they currently possess. This can help to ascertain their level of competence as schoolteachers, and then, for those who are found competent, trying to make a provision/opportunity for them to remain in the teaching profession, especially if their current employers can express a degree of satisfaction with their performance on the job so far, and can testify to their competence and quality.\n\nAnother option could be stipulating other alternative requirements for them, rather than instantly removing them from the classroom or requiring that they go back to school to obtain the required education-related qualifications, especially as they must already have had many years of experience on the job, as well as other equivalent, though not education-related qualifications.\n\nYet another option could be that these teachers be provided with adequate training and development opportunities perhaps within the schools where they currently work, that will expose them to more advanced/improved methods of performing their duties as schoolteachers, and help them update their skills and competence level. This would be more preferable than requesting that they go back to school to obtain an education-related qualification such as the NCE, B.Ed or PGDE, etc, especially as they must have already spent many years in school to obtain a B.Sc, B.Eng, or B.A, etc, before eventually securing a job as a schoolteacher. This requirement can cause them to lose their jobs as teachers \u2013 entirely removing them from an occupation that they have come to love and for which they have developed a strong passion.

          "title": "Sylvester Oromoni, others: Boarding schools now death chambers?",
          "text": "The controversial death of 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos state, Sylvester Oromoni Junior, has revived agitations for investigation into allegation of wrongful deaths, maltreatment and bullying of boarding school students in Abuja, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and other parts of the country. Are boarding schools now death chambers, PAUL OKAH asks in this report.\n\nTo the average Nigerian, bubbling Master Sylvester Oromoni Junior, a boy of 12-year-old, would have been alive today had it been his Delta state-based politician parents did not make the \u201cmistake\u201d of sending him to study in faraway Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos state, where he was reportedly bullied and allegedly killed by fellow students in controversial circumstances for refusing to join a cult group.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 1, a Twitter user identified as Perrie (@perrisonoromoni, first broke the news of the death of Omoroni, attaching the tweet with the photo of the deceased, which was later taken up by human rights activists and well-meaning Nigerians.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThis is my 12 years old cousin that was beaten to death at a school that cost over 1 million naira. They called my uncle that he got injured playing football. Reaching the hospital, it was confirmed that he was being bullied and beaten up, causing internal damages. They tried to put him in a cult, he refused and they killed him. In a secondary school. They literally beat him to death.\n\n\u201cThe 12-year-old was battered on Friday, but died on Tuesday, after a series of tests and x-rays indicated that he sustained internal injuries. The school management had reached out to Sylvester Oromoni Senior, the deceased\u2019s father, a Delta State politician, claiming the boy sustained injuries while playing football at the school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Delta state, but he goes to a boarding school in Lekki. They called my uncle that his son was injured when he was playing football. Reaching the hospital, it was confirmed that he was being bullied and beaten up, causing internal damages. After tests and x-rays, it was confirmed he was beaten up badly. He died yesterday (Tuesday) morning and his entire body was swollen.\n\n\u201cThe deceased had previously complained about pressures to join a cult group, but the young Oromoni only informed his parents while in the hospital. Before his death, he reportedly said the school\u2019s cult members threatened to kill him if he reported them. Before passing, he said they\u2019d been pressuring him to join a cult. He was admitted on Friday. He said they were going to kill him if he talked.\u201d\n\nPublic outcry\n\nFollowing the public outcry, pressures and reactions elicited by the tweet, Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, ordered the closure of Dowen College on Friday, December 3, detailing security agencies to investigate the incident to a logical conclusion.\n\nSubsequently, on December 6, the family detailed human rights activist, Femi Falana (SAN), to handle the case, while the Lagos state police revealed on December 7 that it arrested three out of the five students mentioned by the deceased as having beaten him up. This is as the House of Representatives directed the Inspector General of Police to investigate all victims of crimes in boarding schools.\n\nPrevious incidents\n\nOromoni was not the first student to have died controversially in a boarding school as the dust was yet to settle on the case of a 14-year-old female student of Premiere Academy in Lugbe, FCT, Keren-Happuch Akpagher, who was allegedly raped to death by a yet to be identified staff of the school. A used condom was reportedly found in her private part.\n\nSimilarly, an 11-year-old student of Deeper Life High School, Akwa Ibom, Don Davis, is still battling to stay alive, after he was allegedly sexually assaulted by seniors.\n\nNigerians fume\n\nSpeaking on the death of Oromoni and other victims, in her verified Facebook page on Friday, December 3, alongside pictures of victims, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Kogi state, Natasha Hadiza Akpoti, detailed the atrocities committed by students and teachers in boarding schools, demanding for justice for victims.\n\nShe said: \u201cSylvester Oromoni, the 12-year-old student of Dowen College, Lagos, died from internal injuries sustained by torture from students for failing to join a cult. Don Davis, the 11yr old student of Deeper Life High School, Akwa Ibom, was sexually assaulted by seniors, while the school tried covering it up. I am glad the fighting spirit of his mother pushes on for justice.\n\n\u201cKeren Akpagher, the 14-year-old student of Premier Academy, Lugbe Abuja, died of sepsis earlier this year. A used condom was found inside of her, possibly raped severely by a staff (security or teacher). She died before she could build up courage to mention names. The school stonewalled the investigation.\n\n\u201cThese three innocent souls are our children. We must all join voices and support the parents to call for criminal charges to be pressed against the schools and those identified as collaborators. Thorough investigation should commence, leaving no stone unturned; no matter how highly placed the parents of the erring wards are.\n\n\u201cWe need the establishment of a body under the supervision of the Federal ministry of education to monitor, supervise and evaluate activities of all private schools (boarding and day) in Nigeria. There is need for the expansion of Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC Nigeria) activities to oversee activities of private schools especially boarding facilities.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFCCPC can, amongst others, pay an impromptu visit to boarding schools to inspect the quality of food served. I remember the watery beans at FGC Idoani and the GGUSS. Oboroke\u2019s watery akamu with chippings of overnight Amala as the same poorly washed pot is used for everything.\n\n\u201cPay a visit to the hostels, especially at night, to see the students sleeping on bare floor, kneeling all night in the cold as punishment, bunk-shocking, dirty toilets, lack of drinking water, not to talk of bathing water, etc. Interview students randomly to unravel and intercept the torture and sexual abuse by fellow students and /or teachers.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, there are so many more students suffering abuse in boarding and day schools, but have had fear imbibed in them that they are too scared to speak up. \u2018A cry for help is a death sentence,\u2019 the victims are often warned.\n\n\u201cSo, take a good look at these three faces. Two dead, one alive. Even the boy, Don, that\u2019s alive will never be the same again. I\u2019ll plead, let\u2019s join voices and forces to have these schools support the call for justice and ensure stringent measures are in place to curb the evil of bullying and abuse.\u201d\n\nCommercialisatio of education\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend, a social commentator, Johnson Edeh, said that many proprietors of private schools thrive in collecting fees from parents and students, without paying attention to their welfare, suggesting the deployment of undercover security agencies to monitor activities in boarding schools.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe best way to get evidence in those schools for proper justice is to register undercover security agents in all the schools in Nigeria by the FG. Let them pretend to be students. Collect forms, get admitted in the schools and get to work as secret agents. They will get all the evidence to prosecute those beasts in the schools sexually assaulting students.\n\n\u201cWe should also teach our children to be bold and courageous too. This country is becoming something else. You send your children to school with hard earned money, yet live with the fear of the unknown. Who is to be blamed? You do all your possible best to train your children at home, yet they go outside and get polluted by the rotten ones.\u201d\n\nParental failure\n\nOn her part, a civil servant, Alhaja Fatima Yusuf, told Blueprint Weekend that there are always tell tale signs of children being abused, advising parents to pay close attention to their children for safety purpose, alleging that students are constantly fed poisons in boarding schools.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf your son or daughter suddenly stay too long in the restroom, if they start locking themselves up in their rooms, if they avoid eye contacts with you (if they used to), if they get irritated and angry unnecessarily, if they start exhibiting strange sleeping routine, like waking up with shouts or shocks, have some talks with them confidentially. They need you.\n\n\u201cThere are statutory supervisory roles for state and federal ministries of education for oversight functions to schools, from primary to tertiary institutions. This is to ensure not just standards of education, but also for the safety and well being of the students. However, corruption has not allowed the government officials to do their jobs well.\n\n\u201cIn some of the schools, where schools fees are over a million per term, these children are fed with junk and unwholesome can foods containing so much preservative chemicals that potentially expose them to cancer later in life. We need government intervention in all schools to correct these anomalies. The government officials should publish quarterly supervisory reports that would make them liable where and when anomaly is detected or occurs.\u201d\n\nTeachers\u2019 take\n\nAlso speaking, a secondary school teacher in Wuse, FCT, Mrs Jennifer Eze, said that boarding schools have become harbinger of death, advising parents to train up their children in day schools.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs a teacher, who is known for discipline and moral lessons, the challenges I face from parents and even my colleagues are enormous.\n\n\u201cThis society detests teachers who try to correct or punish students for wrongdoings. Parents\u2019 responses are dampening our morale by the day. Students do bring phones to school, watching pornographic stuffs in the classroom.\n\n\u201cIf you seize their phones, you will be castigated and fought by parents. This country, with the crop of students we have in our schools, has no future.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I am against boarding schools, because you cannot shift your responsibility as a parent to another fellow all in the name of your career. If the man is busy, the woman should be there for the children. Both of you should not be busy looking for money at the detriment of your children. In Nigeria of today, you can hardly get faithful staff, not with the peanut salaries that most schools are paying. They are only using the job as a stepping stone for greater offer.\n\n\u201cMost of the private schools in Nigeria are after money and nothing else. They will not employ enough and competent staff; just to make excess profit. So, all hands must be on deck to put an end to this. FG, human rights activists, etc, should go after these schools and make them face the music. Every school and everyone involved must be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nParental guidance as panacea\n\nSimilarly, a secondary school teacher in Jabi, Mr Theophilus Nathaniel, said that parents should send their children to day schools in order to effectively monitor their progress and not ship them off to die of moral decadence in boarding schools.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m in the system. I am a Mathematics/Computer teacher at Government Science College, Abuja and its only girl\u2019s school. Although we do have one or two issues, but, to be frank, there are nothing compared to all these problems recorded in private boarding schools. I would always prefer to take my child to government owned secondary schools: either boarding/day.\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but since the advent of private schools in Nigeria, secondary schools have suffered great moral decadence and gross atrocities. Many parents often take their kids to boarding schools, simply because they\u2019re avoiding responsibilities and also many of the children at boarding schools are products of broken homes.\n\n\u201cThere are so many imbalances when it comes to shaping a child within the secondary school cadre. Majority of the shortfalls are mostly found within the private boarding schools. To a large extent, there are little of such terrible atrocities within the government owned schools, because discipline and strict measures are being put in place without petting any child of whosoever to practice rubbish.\u201d\n\nDowen College speaks\n\nAfter initially denying culpability in the death of Oromoni, in a volte-face statement on December 4, signed by its board and management, as a result of pressure and public outcry, Dowen College condoled with the family.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe deceased was dearly loved by his teachers, his fellow students and he was a beacon of light for the school,\u201d adding that his untimely death was \u201ctragic and unfortunate and requires a thorough and proper investigation and that Dowen College is fully committed to this.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cWe are assisting the authorities to get to the bottom of this heartbreaking incident. The first steps taken by the school, in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, has been the immediate closure of the school to aid in the investigation. Understandably, at this time of intense grief and suffering, emotions are raw and tensions are high.\n\n\u201cWe pray that God, who alone knows how to comfort the sorrowing, will comfort Sylvester\u2019s family and all those who loved and knew him. We commiserate with the Oromoni family and the students of Dowen College who have lost a friend and fellow student.\n\n\u201cThis is a traumatic experience. We assure our parents that the school is taking steps to ensure the safety and security of their children and wards.\n\n\u201cThis is paramount. Every child is valued at Dowen College and their health and well-being is of the utmost priority to the school.\u201d\n\nReps seek strict guidelines\n\nFollowing widespread concerns over Oromoni\u2019s death, the House of Representatives, on Tuesday, urged the Federal Ministry of Education to set out strict guidelines for the operations of boarding schools across Nigeria.\n\nThe House, while condemning in strong terms, recent incidences of inhuman treatment and abuses happening in boarding schools across the country, mandated the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to immediately commission and take over the investigation, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of the identified heinous crimes.\n\nThis came Tuesday, following a motion, calling for condemnation of such acts in boarding schools, sponsored by member representing Oruk Anam/Ukanafun federal Constituency, Unyime Idem, who noted that while there is no way to make a broad conclusion as to whether boarding schools are good or bad, some recent developments in Nigeria have triggered public outrage as many share their experiences.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe parents of the deceased said he was attacked for declining to join what he termed as the secondary school\u2019s \u2018cult group\u2019 dominated by older boys at Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnother incident leading to the death of 14-year-old Karen-Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher of Premier Academy, Lugbe, Abuja on the 22nd day of June 2021, is one that left many heartbroken. Her parents narrated how their daughter was sexually assaulted and later died of complications as a result of a condom left in her private part. Six months later, there is still no news of a suspect being arrested.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

Electricity and telecommunications are down.\u201d\n\nRai\u2019s wind speeds eased to 150 kph as it barrelled across the country, dumping torrential rain that flooded villages, uprooting trees and shattering wooden structures.\n\nIt emerged over the South China Sea on Saturday and was headed towards Vietnam, the state weather forecaster said.\n\nSevere Damage\n\n\u201cThis is indeed one of the most powerful storms that has hit the Philippines in the month of December in the last decade,\u201d Alberto Bocanegra, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the Philippines, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe information we are receiving and the pictures we are receiving are very alarming.\u201d\n\nThe overall death toll was least 33, according to official tallies.\n\nThe latest figures come after a disaster official in the central province of Negros Occidental confirmed 13 people had died, most by drowning, and that another 50 were missing in a flood-hit area.\n\n\u201cWe started urging people to evacuate as early as Wednesday but many were reluctant to leave,\u201d Salvador Mesa told AFP.\n\nMore than 18,000 military, police, coast guard and fire personnel will join search and rescue efforts in the worst-affected regions, Mark Timbal, spokesman for the national disaster agency, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThere has been severe damage\u201d on Siargao island and the northern tip of the southern island of Mindanao, Timbal said, referring to areas that took the full force of the typhoon as it slammed into the country.\n\nThere are around 100,000 residents on Siargao, but the population swells with tourists drawn to its beaches and big waves.\n\n\u2018Everything Was Destroyed\u2019\n\nThe Philippine Coast Guard has shared photos on social media showing widespread destruction around Surigao City on Mindanao.\n\nAerial footage showed swathes of rice fields underwater.\n\nAt least three people were killed and dozens injured in the storm, Surigao City Mayor Ernesto Matugas told broadcaster ABS-CBN.\n\nShattered glass from smashed windows, sheets of corrugated iron roofing, power lines and other debris were scattered in the street.\n\nThe vice governor of Dinagat said at least six people had been killed there.\n\nResidents on the island of around 128,000 people were \u201ctrying to repair their houses because even our evacuation centres were torn down,\u201d Nilo Demerey told ABS-CBN.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t seek refuge anywhere else\u2026 everything was destroyed.\u201d\n\nVice President Leni Robredo was in Cebu province where she tweeted photos of motorbikes crowded around a petrol station and people lined up for drinking water.\n\nBocanegra warned the disruption to electricity would affect the water supply, raising concerns about hygiene and disease.\n\nRai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season \u2014 most cyclones typically develop between July and October.\n\nScientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.\n\nThe Philippines \u2014 ranked as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change \u2014 is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.",

          "text": "As COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to sports globally amid the Omicron variant, calls for the postponement of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), have gathered steam.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Super Eagles\u2019 longest-serving coach was dismissed, while Akwa United got rewarded for their title-winning feat.\n\nThese and others, make up First Eleven, as we try to make sense of events in the sporting world in the past week.\n\nRohr\u2019s Sack\n\nWe begin from home where Nigeria on Sunday sacked long-time coach, Gernot Rohr, following a string of unconvincing results.\n\nThe decision came months after Nigeria lost at home to the lowly-rated Central Africa Republic (CAR), and survived a nervy game against Cape Verde to book a place in the playoff stage of the 2022 World Cup qualifier.\n\nDays after Rohr\u2019s dismissal, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick, explained that the decision had to be made to avoid disaster.\n\nAccording to him, the German had lost the dressing and indiscipline was rife in the team.\n\nBut Rohr faulted the NFF for sacking him, maintaining that he met all targets.\n\nA \u2018Surprised\u2019 Move\n\nAlthough the NFF\u2019s decision may not be surprising to many fans in Nigeria, the interim coach of the team, Austin Eguavoen, said he never expected to be handed the role.\n\nThe former Super Eagles defender explained that he also did not see Rohr\u2019s sack coming.\n\n\u201cI would say I was shocked, I was surprised when my name was announced after a brief discussion but I thought Gernot Rohr will continue because it has always been, \u2018Is he going to continue? Is he not going to continue?\u2019 We\u2019re going to sort things out,\u201d Eguavoen told Channels Television.\n\n\u201cAnd then when my bosses spoke to me about it a couple of days ago I was like why not but is there a possibility that we can sort things out with him.\u201d\n\nMoney Rain For Akwa United\n\nAway from Rohr\u2019s sack, Governor Emmanuel Udom rewarded Akwa United following their title-winning feat in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).\n\nUdom in a ceremony to honour the team at the Government House in Uyo on Thursday promised them N100m, a bus, and a plot of land each to the players.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom Governor aside from the reward also urged the team to build on their league victory in the coming season.\n\nNWFL Continues\n\nWhile Akwa United will be waiting for the start of the NPFL to defend their crown, matches have already started in the women\u2019s league better known as the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL).\n\nThe league which began last weekend is already in Match Day 2. Fourteen teams will be competing in two groups of seven teams each.\n\nRivers Angels, last season\u2019s winners, have started their title defense and have four points from two games played so far. But Bayelsa Queens are the leaders in Group A with four points having scored more goals.\n\nIn Group B of the NWFL, Confluence Queens led the chart after winning two of their games played so far.\n\nOkpekpe Race Returns\n\nWorld Athletics has confirmed May 28, 2022, as the new date for the eighth Okpekpe International Road Race.\n\nThe decision is coming after the competition was twice moved \u2013 in 2021 and 2020 \u2013 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer of Pamodzi Sports Marketing \u2013 organisers of the competition \u2013 Mike Itemuagbor, the road race will be back in a better form.\n\n\u201cWe have done all the documentation required and we are delighted that World Athletics has confirmed the date we set for the race,\u201d he said, adding that the Okpekpe Road Race will be held in line with COVID-19 guidelines.\n\nAFCON: Pressure Mounts On CAF\n\nWith less than a month to kickoff, there is pressure on the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to postpone the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).\n\nThe European Club Association, which represents leading clubs across the continent, is among leading voices calling for the postponement of the competition billed for Cameroon early next year.\n\nWith a host of African top stars playing in Europe, several big clubs are expected to lose players for at least to three-week.\n\nWorried by the outbreak of the Omicron variant and a \u201csuitable medical and operational protocol for the AFCON tournament,\u201d ECA is threatening that the clubs will not release players for the competition. Amid clamours for the postponement, CAF insists the AFCON will hold as planned.\n\nUEFA Draw Drama\n\nIn Europe, the UEFA Champions League knockout draws were held earlier in the week but an \u201cerror\u201d from the organisers meant it had to be redone.\n\nUEFA blamed a \u201cmaterial error\u201d due to a \u201ctechnical problem with the software of an external service provider\u201d as it announced that the draw for the first knockout round of its flagship competition would be redone at 1400 GMT. The full fixtures for the knockout phase of the Champions League can be found here.\n\nAguero Bows Out\n\nTwo days after the Champions League knockout phase draws, Argentine star, Sergio Aguero retired from football, ending a career that saw him score 260 goals for Manchester City.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who recently moved to Barcelona and only managed five games, broke down in tears while announcing his retirement from the game in a press conference.\n\nCompatriot, Lionel Messi, was among the first set of people to pay tribute to the former Atletico Madrid forward both of whom won the Copa America earlier this summer.\n\nCOVID-19 Ravages EPL\n\nAguero\u2019s retirement was not the only health-related issue in European football this week. The English Premier League is battling a wave of COVID-19 infections. Owing to the resurgence of the disease, several league games have been called off but opinions are divided on moves for a COVID-19 break.\n\nLiverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is among those who maintain the league should continue while his Arsenal counterpart, Mikel Arteta, is calling for fairness before a decision is taken on the matter.\n\nEngland is also not the only nation where the virus is disrupting football. In Spain, several Real Madrid players have contracted the disease.\n\nF1 Great Hamilton Knighted\n\nAnd just days after missing out on a record-breaking eighth Formula One title in controversial fashion, Lewis Hamilton was knighted by the Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.\n\nThe 36-year-old was recognised in the New Year Honours list for services to motorsport following a year in which he broke Michael Schumacher\u2019s all-time tally for Grand Prix wins and emulated the German by winning a seventh world title.\n\nOn Sunday, however, championship rival Max Verstappen won his first Formula One world title after a season-long battle with Hamilton came down to a one-lap shoot-out in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\u2018Greatness!\u2019 Steve Curry Sets Record\n\nIn basketball, Golden State Warriors star, Stephen Curry, eclipsed Ray Allen\u2019s all-time record for NBA three-pointers with his 2,973rd career three-pointer.\n\nIt came on his first shot of the clash with the New York Knicks, less than two minutes into the contest, and had the crowd on its feet.",

          "text": "Paris on Saturday said it was cancelling its traditional New Year fireworks as Europe braced for tighter curbs to rein in the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus fuelling a resurgence in Covid-19 cases worldwide.\n\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen has warned the Omicron coronavirus variant could be dominant in Europe by mid-January.\n\nMany countries have decided to reintroduce travel restrictions and other containment measures since it was first detected in South Africa last month.\n\n\u201cWith regard to the acceleration of the pandemic, and the risks related to the end-of-year festivities, authorities should impose significant restrictions,\u201d France\u2019s scientific panel said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Death Toll From Philippines Typhoon Passes 30\n\nAnd Paris municipal authorities announced \u201cwith regret that we will have to cancel all the festivities planned on the Champs Elysees on December 31.\n\n\u201cThe fireworks will not take place, nor unfortunately will there be any DJ sets,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office told AFP.\n\nOn Friday, Germany designated France and Denmark as high-risk zones, and said it would impose quarantine on unvaccinated travellers from its two neighbours, starting from Sunday.\n\nIn Ireland, bars and restaurants will have to close from 8:00 pm from Sunday until January 30, prime minister Micheal Martin announced.\n\nDenmark, which this week had the highest per capita new Covid infection rate, said it would close cinemas, theatres and concert halls and restrict restaurant opening hours.\n\nAnd Switzerland is also stepping up anti-Covid measures from Monday as the country battles an intense fifth wave of the virus, which has killed at least 5,335,968 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019.\n\nThe Dutch government is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on Saturday afternoon after its team of expert scientific advisers recommended new restrictions to rein in Omicron, media reports said.\n\nAccording to the reports, the government will hold a news conference at 1800 GMT to announce the new measures.\n\nInoculating Children\n\nA number of countries are opening up their immunisation drives to younger children, even though the EU\u2019s health agency has warned that jabs alone will not be sufficient to stop the variant\u2019s rise.\n\nIn Portugal, where 88.9 percent of the population is vaccinated, more than 60,000 children aged between five and 11 were set to receive their first jab of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine this weekend.\n\nAnd in France, Health Minister Olivier Veran said that jabs will start to be administered to children in the same age group from Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we will start vaccination of children on the afternoon of December 22 in specially adapted centres,\u201d he told France Inter radio.\n\nNevertheless, the EU health agency ECDC has said measures like mask-wearing, distance working and the prevention of crowds were essential to reduce the burden on healthcare systems in the time available, with vaccines alone taking too long.\n\nThe EU\u2019s medicines watchdog last month approved the lower-dosage Pfizer-BioNTech shot for five to 11-year-olds, an age group experiencing high coronavirus infection rates across the continent.\n\nThe United States was the first large country to take the plunge and has so far vaccinated more than five million children in the five-to-11 age bracket.\n\nDenmark was one of the first European countries to open vaccination to all over-fives on November 26, though it is not compulsory.\n\nInside a converted commercial warehouse in a suburb of the Danish capital, seven-year-old William was one of a number of children waiting for their first Covid jab.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared, I\u2019ve already done it 100 times,\u201d he said, showing off to his younger brother.\n\nAnother youngster, Camelia, said she was more than happy to get the jab.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the family was vaccinated, I was the last one,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy I did it because now if I get corona, I won\u2019t feel anything.\u201d",

          "title": "Following Confirmation of Otedola as Largest Shareholder, FBN Holdings Names Abdullahi New Chairman",
          "text": "In what is evidently a battle for the control of FBN Holdings (FBNH), Remi Babalola on Friday resigned as Chairman, Board of Directors of the company, two days after FBNH confirmed significant investment by billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola.\n\nFBN Holdings is the parent company of First Bank of Nigeria.\n\nOn the same day, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that it had okayed the appointment of Alhaji Ahmad Abdullahi as non-executive Director of FBN Holding Plc and Chairman of the company to replace Babalola.\n\nAs at press time, it was not clear whether, Abdullahi was nominated by Otedola, who is now the single largest shareholder in the company.\n\nIndustry sources said FBNH had on Wednesday informed regulators about Otedola\u2019s new position as the single largest shareholder.\n\nLast week, Otedola acquired an additional 2.5 per cent in FBN Holdings Plc., becoming the single largest shareholder in the company.\n\nBased on this, the equity stake of Otedola is now 7.57 per cent of the issued share capital of FBNH.\n\nIn a corporate filing on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) on Wednesday, FBN Holdings confirmed the deals.\n\nDespite his shareholding status, Otedola had said the move was purely an investment decision and not to become the chairman or hold any key position in the HoldCo.\n\n\u201cBeing the single largest shareholder doesn\u2019t mean I must necessarily hold a position in the bank. I believe in allowing competent people to run institutions in a professional manner and to the benefit of all the stakeholders,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe CBN on Friday okayed the appointment of Abdullahi as the new Chairman of FBNH to replace Balalola.\n\nIts Director of Corporate Communications, Osita Nwanisobi, disclosed in a statement that the bank had been duly notified of the resignation of Babalola, as Chairman of the company against the backdrop of contest by some significant shareholders for control of the financial institution.\n\nWhile congratulating Abdullahi on his appointment, the CBN described Babalola\u2019s resignation as the Chairman of the company as highly regrettable, especially given the fact that CBN\u2019s regulatory interventions had made positive impact and increased attractiveness of the company to both local and foreign investors.\n\nNotwithstanding the recent development, he said the CBN acknowledged the measured achievements recorded by the company under Babalola\u2019s watch, and thanked him for his service, even as the CBN wished him well in his future endeavours.\n\nAccording to Nwanisobi, the regulatory measures taken by the CBN were yielding the expected results in terms of overhaul of corporate governance practices, restoration of confidence in the bank\u2019s brand, increased transparency and due process in transactions as well as improved financial performance.\n\nIn line with its statutory mandate, the CBN spokesman said the CBN remained committed to ensuring transparent governance practices at the bank and the continued independence of the chairman and other persons holding key governance positions.\n\nGiven the systemic importance of First Bank owing to its historical significance, balance sheet size, large customer base and high level of interconnectedness with other financial service providers, the CBN had in April 2021, taken decisive regulatory action to address corporate governance infractions at the bank leading to the removal of the board of First Bank Ltd and FBN Holdco Plc and appointment of a new board.\n\nAbdullahi is an economist and thorough-bred professional with long years of experience in the academia, banking supervision and financial regulation, retiring as Director of Banking Supervision, CBN in February 2020.\n\nAn expert in bank crisis resolution, he also serves on the boards of the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), FMDQ, NDIC and AMCON.\n\nBabalola was appointed chairman, April 29, 2021, and had spent a little over six months.\n\nIn a parting mail, Babalola wrote: \u201cMy esteemed Co-Directors of First Bank, the over 7-months journey since my appointment by the CBN to the Board of the Holdings Company has been a mix of hard work, sacrifices, battles and consensus building, all aimed at returning the institution to the path of stability and sustainable growth.\n\nThough, the assigned mandate has been daunting, we have within the short period successfully reinstated confidence in the institution, overhauled its corporate governance and introduced openness and due process in all transactions.\n\n\u201cHowever, after deep reflection on recent developments relative to my personal values, I resigned my appointment as a Non-Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of FBN Holdings with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cI thank you for your unflinching support, co-operation and valuable contributions during my short leadership. I wish you the very best as you soldier on.\u201d\n\nObinna Chima",
