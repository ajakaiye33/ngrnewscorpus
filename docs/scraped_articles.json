          "text": "Following the assessment of the \u2018No Vehicle Inspection, No Road Worthiness Certificate\u2019 Policy which commenced in January 2022, the Lagos State Government has introduced a Booking System to stem the surge recorded at some vehicle inspection centres.\n\nExplaining the amendment made on the procedure of receiving a Roadworthiness Certificate in the State, the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, stated that the vehicle inspection will now be based on scheduled appointments.\n\nHe said the 30 days window of inspection period has been reviewed to 60 days to reduce panic surge presently seen in some of the inspection test centres, adding that the backlog of already referred vehicles will be cleared between now and February 14 to give room for the Booking System.\n\nOladeinde also maintained that the policy which was introduced to clamp down on rickety vehicles responsible for incessant accidents, loss of lives and property within the metropolis is equally poised at addressing the traffic congestion caused by several breakdowns of vehicles due to the old process which is no longer sustainable.\n\nThe commissioner affirmed that public transport owners are not left behind in the new policy regime as some have had their vehicles already checked.\n\n\u201cVehicle Inspection Officers are also engaging other commercial drivers at various motor parks for vehicle checks to further reduce convergence of vehicles at the inspection test centres,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stated that the State Government is ramping up consultation with private partners with vehicle inspection facilities to increase the present existing 27 centres spread across the State, with five more mobile test centres already on the way.\n\nApplauding Motorists who have submitted to the Inspection at the Lagos State Computerised Centres across the State, the Commissioner noted that out of 26,442 that were inspected in January, 15,998 passed, while 10,444 failed the minimum safety standard tests, adding that some of the failed vehicles have reported for a retest while awaiting others.\n\nWhile urging residents of the State, especially motorists to cooperate fully with the new policy to further ease traffic flow, and improve safety, the Transport Commissioner maintained that a seamless transportation system is key to achieving a multi-modal megacity.",

          "text": "27 ships with petrol, others to berth in Apapa, Delta ports\n\nBy Godwin Oritse\n\nTHE Nigerian Importers Integrity Association (NIIA) has called on the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and other relevant agencies including the Nigeria Customs Service, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to halt the activities of unregulated private jetties and oil service centres that have converted their facilities to container terminals.\n\nThe President of the association, Godwin Onyekazi, said some private jetties operating on the Kirikiri channel and oil service facilities now engage in handling containers.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps demand thorough probe, justice for Hanifa Abubarkar\n\nHe said, \u201cHundreds of empty containers are loaded from unlicensed jetties on the Kirikiri channel onto big barges which then discharge these containers in neighboring countries. It is not clear who licensed these barge operators and the jetties, if these barges and jetties are registered with all relevant authorities and finally if they are paying the statutory dues to NPA and all other governmental agencies\u201d.\n\nHe said while waiting for the authorities to address these concerns, it is clear that the operators are in breach of existing regulations.\n\n\u201cOnly port operators, concessioned by the Federal Government through NPA can engage in container handling operations. Loading of empties from any other facility is illegal and should be investigated.\n\n\u201cThe jetties in question are now illegally operating as container terminals. Empty containers are loaded from sub-standard jetty in Kirikiri on barges and sail straight out of Nigeria to the ports of neighboring countries, especially to Cotonou and Lome ports.\n\n\u201cThis trend is dangerous, as it poses serious economic and security implications for Nigeria. Who licensed the jetties as container terminals? Who is monitoring their activities? Nigeria is so volatile now that we cannot afford this sort of lapses in our port operation.\n\n\u201cUnscrupulous persons try to beat the various economic and security checks put in place at the main ports where all the security agencies are present. Can you then imagine what will be happening in jetties that do not have strong regulatory and security mechanisms? This not to talk of the safety aspect, which is totally neglected,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyekazi said the illegal container terminal operators have been handling empty containers on sub-standard jetties for various shipping lines, and may evolve into handling laden containers if their activities remain unchecked by NPA and other government agencies.",

Today you have seen where we are; how our constituency has been completely relegated because we have no voice any more!\n\n\u201d It\u2019s not about Mao Ohuabunwa; it\u2019s all about Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency which I was privileged to be the first representative.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in office, I regularly held town-hall meetings where we interacted and I presented my scores cards. But nobody has invited me for any town-hall meeting since 2019\u201d.\n\nThe former Leader ECOWAS Parliament, called for rediscovery of the constituency, unity and patriotism among political gladiators in the area to recover the lost grounds.\n\nHe noted that though he had cause to be angry owing to the way he was sabotaged in 2019, he had however, decided to lead from the front to ensure the constituency regained its place of pride in the Abia political map.\n\nSenator Ohuabunwa said mentorship was necessary in politics, avering that those who have no respect for their political mentors do not go far in politics.\n\n\u201d If you don\u2019t respect your political mentors, you won\u2019t go far in politics and your tenure will not be stable\u201d, he said.\n\nDecrying the political condition of the constituency, Ohuabunwa said :\u201d Parliament is not for everybody, any camaraderie can be in the executive where he uses aides to do the work but not so in the parliament\u201d.\n\nVarious speakers at the meeting decried the political condition of the constituency and vowed to synergise to change the tide come 2023.\n\nThey pleaded with Ohuabunwa to put behind him the wrongs of 2019, and join the 2023 contest, vowing to give him massive support to return to the senate.\n\nThe stakeholders regretted that since Ohuabunwa\u2019s exit from the red chamber in 2019, \u201cAbia North senatorial zone has become voiceless and an object of comic relief at the senate\u201d.\n\nIn a remark, former member representing Arochukwu Ohafia federal consituency,\n\nHon. Kalu Igu Uduma, lamented lack of unity and the sorry-state of things which he warned, posed grave danger to the political future of the constituency.\n\nHe urged Ohuabunwa to heed the calls to return to the senate for a rescue mission of both the constituency and Abia North senatorial district.\n\nFormer member, Ohafia State constituency, Hon. Mba Ukaha, said \u201cour constituency is now a laughing stock\u201d, and threatened to fight Ohuabunwa if he failed to heed the appeals to contest for senate in 2023.\n\nFormer PDP Legal Adviser, South East, Chief Ukpai Ukiro, said the stakeholders were resolute in the appeal for Ohuabunwa to join the senatorial race.\n\nHe also said that the people had realised their mistakes, and were now determined to right the wrongs for the future of the constituency.\n\nFormer State Women Leader of PDP, and Commissioner for Women Affairs, Chief Nnenna Obewu, vowed to mobilise Abia North women in support of Senator Ohuabunwa.\n\nThe meeting was attended by PDP stalwarts in the constituency including the Security Adviser to the Governor, Capt.

          "text": "The Purple Hope Initiative Nigeria (PHIN) has decried a comment by Living Faith Church Founder, Bishop David Oyedepo.\n\nIn January, the cleric warned Nigerians who criticize pastors to desist or face punishments such as leprosy.\n\nA rejoinder by PHIN, which is supported by the German Leprosy Relief Association (GLRA), condemned the \u201cdiscriminatory remarks\u201d.\n\nThe body told Oyedepo that leprosy, also known as Hansen\u2019s disease, is not what should be used as a threat or curse.\n\nCaroline Cassard of Global Partnership for Zero Leprosy, at The Task Force for Global Health, sent an open letter to DAILY POST.\n\nThe letter advised Oyedepo to discuss how to address the harm done to the Hansen\u2019s disease community, both in Nigeria and globally.\n\nIt reads: \u201cAs a Nigerian organization of people who have experienced Hansen\u2019s disease, we are dismayed to read media reports where you claim that insulting a prophet can cause leprosy. These statements are inaccurate and further stigmatize.\n\n\u201cMore than 200,000 people are diagnosed with Hansen\u2019s disease each year, and there are believed to be more than two million individuals affected by Hansen\u2019s disease who are undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n\u201cNegative social attitudes towards people who have experienced Hansen\u2019s disease create a serious barrier to treatment and hinder global efforts to interrupt the transmission of the disease.\n\n\u201cHansen\u2019s disease is caused by bacteria and is curable with an antibiotic regimen called multi-drug therapy. Hansen\u2019s disease is not hereditary, and it is not a curse.\n\n\u201cHowever, people affected by this disease are still marginalized and excluded from communities around the globe. They are isolated by families and friends. They lose their jobs, marriages, property, and experience human rights violations.\n\n\u201cPeople who have experienced Hansen\u2019s disease deserve to live dignified and respectable lives. Their diagnosis must not define them, and they must not be excluded from their communities.\u201d\n\nThe letter denounced the misuse of leprosy as a metaphor, reminding public figures, including religious leaders, of their duty to respect millions of people affected.\n\nIt said even if Oyedepo did not intend to discriminate against those who have experienced the health condition, his words have negatively impacted \u201cour efforts and our existence\u201d.\n\nPHIN urged him to join the fight against the disease as well as the total elimination of all forms of stigmatization and discrimination against the victims.",

          "text": "The Court of Appeal in Abuja has reserved judgment in two appeals seeking to set aside the December 20, 2021 judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja voiding Andy Uba\u2019s participation in the last governorship election in Anambra State as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nA three-man panel of the court, led by Justice Stephen Adah, took the decision after lawyers to parties adopted their written briefs on Wednesday.\n\nJustice Adah announced, that the appeals having, been heard, judgment in each of the appeal is reserved to a date to be communicated to parties.\n\nAPC and Uba are contending, in the appeals that the Federal High Court in Abuja erred in law in holding in December 20 that the APC did not conduct a valid primary and therefore, did not present a valid candidate for the election.\n\nThe first appeal heard was the one marked: CA/A/CV/13/2022 filed by the APC through its lawyer, Mahmud Magaji (SAN).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRespondents in the appeal are Dr. George Moghalu, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Emmanuel Andy Nnamdi Uba.\n\nMagaji, while adopting the appellant\u2019s briefs, prayed the court to allow the appeal and set aside the earlier judgment by the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nLawyer to Moghalu, Chris Uche (SAN) also adopted the first respondent\u2019s brief and prayed the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment of the Federal High Court.\n\nLawyers to INEC and the APC filed no brief.\n\nIn the second appeal, marked: CA/A/CV/36/2022 filed by Uba, appellant\u2019s lawyer, Abdullahi Aliyu urged the court to allow the appeal and reject their earlier judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nAliyu said the appellant\u2019s argument is that a High Court in Awka had upheld the primary conducted by the APC, and that as it stands, there are two conflicting judgments on the issue of whether or not the APC conducted a valid primary which produced Uba as the party\u2019s candidate for the election.\n\nUche, who represented the first respondent (Moghalu), urged the court to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit.\n\nHe also urged the court to uphold the earlier judgment by the Federal High Court.\n\nIn the judgment of the Federal High Court given in December 20, 2021, Justice Inyang Ekwo held among others, that Uba was never a candidate in the election held on November 6 having emerged from an illegally conducted primary election held by the APC.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that the plaintiff, Moghalu (an APC aspirant for the election) succeeded in proving that the APC did not conduct a valid primary election from which Uba claimed to have emerged as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nThe judgment was on a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/648/201 with the APC, the INEC and Uba listed as defendants.\n\nMoghalu had queried the legitimacy of the governorship primary election purportedly conducted by the APC on June 26, 2021, which allegedly produced Uba as the party\u201ds candidate for the November 6, 2021 election.\n\nJustice Ekwo, in the judgment, said: \u201cThe real issue in this case, which both the first defendant (APC) and third defendant (Uba) seem not to understand is not whether accredited members of the first defendant voted on 26th June, 2021 but whether there was any primary election at all conducted in accordance with the mandatory provisions of both the Electoral Act (as amended) and first defendant\u2019s Guidelines for the Nomination of Candidates for the Anambra 2021 Gubernatorial Election-Direct Primaries (Option A4).\n\n\u201cWhen a primary election is illegal, the fact that such illegal election was monitored by the Nigeria Police (or other security agencies) as averred in paragraph 25 (ii) of the third defendant\u2019s counter-affidavit is of no moment.\n\n\u201cThe combination of the evidence, in this case, by both the first and third defendants has created doubt in me that gubernatorial primary election of the first defendant for the nomination of its candidate for the Anambra State Governorship held at all or was held in accordance with the provisions of the Act (as amended) and first defendant\u2019s Guidelines for the Electoral f Nomination of Candidates for the Anambra 2021 Gubernatorial Election Direct Primaries (Option A4).\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the evidence in this case that the first defendant connived with the third defendant to conduct election outside the time prescribed by Articles 17 (vi) and 18(e), (g) and (i) of the first defendant\u2019s Guidelines for the Nomination of Candidates for the Anambra 2021 Gubernatorial Election-Direct Primaries (Option A4) to the exclusion of the plaintiff.\n\n\u201cAt the end, the votes in Exhibit MAM 9 of the third defendant were gratuitously awarded to other aspirants while the third defendant retained the highest votes. Now, the ingenuity of the first and third defendants has resulted in illegality and has backfired.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it is my finding that the plaintiff has demonstrate upon preponderance of evidence that the gubernatorial primary election of the first defendant was not conducted in accordance with the provisions of sections 85 (2) and 87(1) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and Articles 17 (vi) and 18(e),(g) and (i) of first defendant\u2019s Guidelines for the Nomination of Candidates for the Anambra 2021 Gubernatorial Election-Direct Primaries (Option A4).\n\n\u201cTherefore, the case of the plaintiff succeeds on the merit,\u201d the judge said.\n\nJustice Ekwo declared that the primary held by the APC was not in compliance with relevant laws and guidelines.\n\nThe judge issued an order compeling INEC to delist the APC and Uba from among the list of political parties and candidates for the November 6 election.\n\nHe retrained Uba from further holing himself out or parading himself as a candidate in the election.\n\nThe judge ordered the APC to refund to the plaintiff the N22,500.000 he paid for expression of interest and nomination forms since the party failed to conduct a valid primary.",

          "title": "Sylva Doubts Nigeria\u2019s Petrol Consumption Figures, Says Numbers Crazy, Opaque",
          "text": "\u2022Elumelu raises concerns over $4bn oil theft, insists its national disgrace\n\nJames Emejo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, yesterday expressed doubts over Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures, describing them as crazy and opaque.\n\nThe minister who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned broadcast station, in apparent frustration, noted that there\u2019s nothing that needed to be interrogated that had not been questioned on the subsidy matter.\n\nAlso, the Founder/Chairman of Heirs Holdings Limited, Mr. Tony Elumelu, yesterday said incessant oil theft in the Niger Delta region remained a major national challenge requiring urgent attention by the country\u2019s leadership. Elumelu, while delivering the National Defence College, Course 30 Lecture titled: \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d further described the activities of oil thieves as a national disgrace which requires national seminar and dialogue to address.\n\nSylva agreed that figures released by concerned authorities were questionable, stressing that the best solution to the issue would have been to completely remove the subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s subsidy regime has for decades remained a subject of controversy, with the figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres.\n\nAs at today, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) is the sole importer of the product, since private businessmen exited the scene due to non-availability of foreign exchange years ago.\n\nHaving backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy as dictated by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the executive arm of government is set to approach the National Assembly to approve the N3 trillion for the payment of subsidies in 2022. The government last week extended the implementation by 18 months.\n\nThe minister alleged that a few persons were holding the rest of the country to ransom, explaining that the rich rather than the most vulnerable in the country gain more from the payment of subsidies than the poor.\n\nSpeaking on the dynamics of rising consumption figures and increasing subsidy payment, Sylva explained that although there was something fishy about the data, there\u2019s nothing that hadn\u2019t been done in the past to muscle those bleeding the country without success.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling some of the smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or to the 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque . The opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we get just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all.\n\n\u201cI know when people say the figures are\u2026 I mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no, no, no. There\u2019s been trial of subsidy thieves. Oh, we\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the template, these are the components of the templates,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister was reacting to the insistence by a co-guest, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, an energy law expert and President Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), that Nigeria must investigate how many litres it consumes, among others.\n\nThe minister maintained that even labour which is against the removal of the subsidy knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to hemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues. We can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing as you agree with me, to continue to be hemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budgeted. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to be benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidised environment, reason the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the Export Free Zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port, because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed his to sell at a profit internationally. If we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government in that case, is the cost of freight,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that that it was his own model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime,\u201d Sylva added.\n\nOn the issue of pipeline maintenance and repairs, the minister stressed that under the PIA, the refineries will be managed distinctly from the crude oil pipelines.\n\nDescribing it as a very thorny issue, he expressed the view that the PIA will be the solution to some of the current problems with managing the pipelines.\n\nHe pointed out that before now, the midstream in the industry was grossly under-developed because the fiscals were not there.\n\n\u201cIf you have a situation where somebody owns a refinery and then at the same time is expected to run a pipeline that is 600 kilometres long, then it becomes difficult for him to run.\n\n\u201cHe should focus on running a refinery if it\u2019s a refinery operator, then you must have somebody who also focuses on running the pipeline and it becomes his business.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Nigeria, we never saw the pipeline as a business. So the pipeline was always an attachment to a refinery. It was becoming very sub-optimally managed because the refinery operators could not manage the pipelines.\n\n\u201cSo what we are now doing is to decouple the pipelines from the refineries, outsource those pipelines to people who can now focus on managing the pipelines. So it will be a different ballgame after the fixing of the refineries, he assured\u201d\n\nOmorogbe had in her comments, said that the reforms in the industry were unnecessarily slow, with the PIA taking over 20 years to bring to fruition.\n\n\u201cThe downstream has been in a mess for a long time. Any downstream operator will tell you that off the record, and will tell you that it\u2019s worsening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just in pains to know how we can implement the petroleum industry act. But I think a lot of the problem is that Nigerians have never really interrogated what this subsidy is, if it\u2019s there to cushion us against the different price effects of importing petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWhat are the components of what is being paid for subsidy? When you look at landing cost, what are the components of that landing costs? How much of it is the demurrage for example?\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying for the incompetence of the system? If the government would get out of this area, I can see that many things would be wiped out, even though one is talking about temporarily having the price shoot up, it\u2019ll come down.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s competition. No private person will pay for some of the things that are happening right now. That\u2019s why I say I really don\u2019t know where to start. But we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s interrogate and say, how many litres do we use in Nigeria every day? Statistics in the downstream is incredibly opaque,\u201d she argued\n\nElumelu Raises Concerns over $4bn Oil Theft, Says Its National Disgrace\n\nAccording to Elumelu, who is also the Chairman of the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), between January and September last year, Nigeria lost over $4 billion to oil thieves\n\nwho don\u2019t pay tax but use their illicit proceeds to acquire more lethal ammunition and continued to pose threats to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nHe expressed worry that the development had put so much money in the hands of those who don\u2019t pay tax and who are not regulated, making the country unsafe.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, and thieves take 50,000 per day.\u201d\n\nHe said addressing the sordid situation required strategic as well as resilience of leadership adding that, \u201cthings can\u2019t continue that way. The country should wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to men and women of this country to help remove this national disgrace,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe theft in the Niger Delta is a national challenge. To me, it requires national seminar and dialogue. It is in my viewpoint, one of the lethal threats to our country, because it is so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate and the country is not safe.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last three quarters of last year from January to September lost over $4 billion to thieves who don\u2019t pay tax and they use it to pile more lethal ammunition and pose threats to our corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the growing youth restiveness in Nigeria and Africa to the absence of strategic leadership principles which he said among others required setting priorities, execution of goals, setting of timelines and milestones as well as clarity of purpose.\n\nHe said these leadership principles had helped shape his focus and eventual successes in the private sector, stressing that they are as well applicable to the public sector if results must be achieved.\n\nElumelu in the course of his lecture also touched on the need for leaders to match words with actions so people don\u2019t lose interest in their leadership.\n\nHe also emphasised the need to pay attention to merit and ensure that the most qualified persons are appointed to positions of authority.\n\nOn the role of private sector in fighting terror and promoting peace in the continent, the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation said he had been a proponent of African capitalism which he believes would lead to long-term investment to address endemic poverty.\n\nHe argued that people who have economic hope do not take to extremism, saying only jobless persons are susceptible to social vices.\n\nHe said governments must get serious with eradicating poverty and creating economic opportunities for the growing youth population in order to avert a greater catastrophe.\n\n\u201cUnless we get serious on our continent, it\u2019s just starting, \u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere can\u2019t be peace when people are hungry. It\u2019s an imposed peace and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it explodes.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, what African youths need is economic opportunity and not interested in handouts adding that they presently lacked such opportunity.\n\nElumelu said government must wake up and realise that the young ones would someday hold them accountable.\n\nHe said the fact that 60 per cent of the Nigeria\u2019s population lived below the poverty index had more to do about leadership.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can correct these things. We need to do more. Poverty is the reason we have problems in the world.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

According to agency reports, possible casualties were unclear.\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent is forcing some analysts to call for the establishment of an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) military force in the form of ECOMOG, to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nA security source told journalists in Bissau that at the government\u2019s palace, an unknown number of people were hit by gunfire with two persons killed. But it was unclear who the casualties were.\n\nIt was also learnt that Sissoco Embalo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the building with a heavy security detail.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the normally busy streets around the palace were deserted in the afternoon, with an unverified video shared on social media appeared to show a man standing outside the compound firing a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nThe government has however been silent about the incident as no official statement has been made.\n\nThe West Africa region has been mired by military take-over in the last 18 months with military take over in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is not new to coup d\u2019etat as for decades, there has been history of nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974. This has severely affected her economy which relies heavily on the export of cashew nuts.\n\nThe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which some analysts are calling for, was a West African multilateral armed force established by the sub-regional body. ECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, among others.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).

          "text": "\u2022Dangote pledges private sector support\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari launched a N62 billion trust fund yesterday in Abuja aimed at curtailing the scourge of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Nigeria. The fund would also help to place more people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) on treatment annually.\n\nChief Launcher and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, promised strong support for the private sector-led fund.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria (HTFN), Buhari pledged that his administration would continue to prioritise health interventions to address killer diseases and public health emergencies.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, Buhari said, \u201cEnding AIDS as a public health threat in Nigeria will require increased domestic funding. We have continued to make good our commitment of placing more people living with HIV on treatment annually using national resources.\n\n\u201cAt the last United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, I made a call for a renewed global action to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\n\u201dHowever, strong domestic resource mobilisation with an enduring partnership and shared responsibility is required to sustain the response to HIV and other emerging public health emergencies.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s focused partnership with the private sector in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided a readily available financing solution to leverage on to sustain the HIV response. He commended the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) and the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS for their efforts in establishing the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria to secure a generation of babies free of the virus.\n\nBuhari also expressed delight at the attendance in person of key global players in the HIV response and notable private sector personalities at the event and the pledges made.\n\n\u201dGoing forward, I hope the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria will galvanise more of the private sector and other partners to surpass the target of N62 billion in the next five years,\u201d the president added.\n\nIn his remarks, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, disclosed that since 2005, about $6.2 billion had been spent on HIV response in Nigeria.\n\nMustapha stated, \u201dAbout 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors, mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The private sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging NACA\u2019s efforts to promote resource mobilisation to complement existing external support, Mustapha said the federal government had sustained the treatment and financing of 50,000 People Living with HIV (PLHIV) annually. He said the launch of the HTFN would guarantee funding from private sector-led resources for HIV interventions, especially for the elimination of the Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\nDangote said the mission of the fund, proposed by NACA alongside the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS (NiBUCAA), was to ensure mobilisation of resources towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, starting with the Prevention of Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dI am reminded that we have two million of our compatriots living with HIV/AIDS and it is our collective responsibility to bring this number down to zero,\u201d he said.\n\nDangote, who is Africa\u2019s richest man, appealed to individuals and corporate organisations in the country to donate generously to the Fund.\n\n\u201dWe would like the private sector to work in partnership with the federal government on a 50-50 basis, which we believe will help us eliminate Mother-to-Child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria,\u201d Dangote said.\n\nChairman of Board of Trustees of the fund and Group Managing Director of Access Bank, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, in his remarks, said the aim of the initiative was to ensure sustainable mobilisation of resources from the private sector towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, beginning with the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the HIV virus.\n\nWigwe stated, \u201cWe have a responsibility to safeguard the future of our country, our workforce, and our children yet unborn. With your support, we can change the narrative; put an end to mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Nigeria, eradicate AIDS and, ultimately, put a stop to the transmission of HIV in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWigwe said the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria become imperative to help bridge the existing, as well as projected funding shortfalls that will occur once international donor funding began to exit.\n\nAccording to him, the HIV Trust Fund \u201cwould be a unique opportunity to proactively take decisive steps to avoid a potential HIV/AIDS crisis in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome speech, Director-General of NACA, Dr. Gambo Aliyu, thanked Buhari for his commitment and support for HIV response in the country. Aliyu said as a direct result of the president\u2019s intervention, NACA now procured HIV commodities at manufacturers\u2019 rate, and more Nigerians living with HIV had been placed on treatment from domestic resources.\n\nHe said within the last three years, the agency had identified and placed on treatment an additional 900,000 persons living with HIV, bringing the total number of Nigerians on HIV treatment to 1.7 million.\n\nAliyu stated, \u201cThis unprecedented feat puts Nigeria on a fast-track lane to control HIV spread by 2023. However, despite these achievements, our national coverage of prevention of mother-to- child transmission is less than 50 per cent, leading to about 22,000 cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV every year in the country.\u201d\n\nThe director general said providing life-long treatment to all PLHIV even after successfully stopping new HIV infections would require a domestically sustainable financing mechanism.\n\nKey development partners present at the unveiling of the fund included Executive Director, UNAIDS, Ms. Winnie Byanyima; Executive Director, Global Fund, Mr. Peter Sands; and US Ambassador to Nigeria, Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard.\n\nOther members of the fund\u2019s Board of Trustees are Managing Director of TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster; Chairman, Board of Trustees of Dangote Foundation, and President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; Managing Director, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Engineer Osagie Okunbor; Managing Director/CEO, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Dr. Lars Richter; and Director General of NACA, Dr. Gambo Aliyu.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Timipre Sylva, the minister of petroleum resources, says Nigeria needs to move away from the petrol subsidy regime to end its \u2018opaqueness\u2019.\n\nSylva added that Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures are \u2018crazy\u2019.\n\nThe minister, who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) on Tuesday, noted that \u201cthere is nothing on the subsidy matter that had not been questioned\u201d.\n\nA co-guest, Yinka Omorogbe, president of Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), said that Nigeria must investigate how many litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) it consume and the differential between the landing cost and subsidy, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to her comment, Sylva noted that the figures fixed for Nigeria\u2019s fuel consumption are inflated.\n\nThe implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which made provision for deregulation of the oil and gas industry, may be suspended.\n\nThe federal government had proposed an 18-month extension of its implementation \u2014 retaining fuel subsidy that gulped N1.4 trillion in 2021. The proposal will go through the national assembly for ratification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2022, the government said it would spend N3 trillion on fuel subsidy payments.\n\n\u201cBut we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me, what is the total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me, that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been trials of subsidy thieves. We\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the templates, these are the components of the templates.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the labour union, which is against the removal of the subsidy, knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to haemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cWe can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing, as you agree with me, to continue to be haemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budget. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit.\u201d\n\nHe noted that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidy regime, because the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the export free zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed him to sell at a profit internationally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government, in that case, is the cost of freight.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that it was his model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime.\u201d",

          "text": "Timipre Sylva, the minister of petroleum resources, says Nigeria needs to move away from the petrol subsidy regime to end its \u2018opaqueness\u2019.\n\nSylva added that Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures are \u2018crazy\u2019.\n\nThe minister, who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) on Tuesday, noted that \u201cthere is nothing on the subsidy matter that had not been questioned\u201d.\n\nA co-guest, Yinka Omorogbe, president of Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), said that Nigeria must investigate how many litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) it consume and the differential between the landing cost and subsidy, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to her comment, Sylva noted that the figures fixed for Nigeria\u2019s fuel consumption are inflated.\n\nThe implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which made provision for deregulation of the oil and gas industry, may be suspended.\n\nThe federal government had proposed an 18-month extension of its implementation \u2014 retaining fuel subsidy that gulped N1.4 trillion in 2021. The proposal will go through the national assembly for ratification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2022, the government said it would spend N3 trillion on fuel subsidy payments.\n\n\u201cBut we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me, what is the total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me, that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been trials of subsidy thieves. We\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the templates, these are the components of the templates.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the labour union, which is against the removal of the subsidy, knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to haemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cWe can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing, as you agree with me, to continue to be haemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budget. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit.\u201d\n\nHe noted that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidy regime, because the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the export free zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed him to sell at a profit internationally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government, in that case, is the cost of freight.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that it was his model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime.\u201d",

          "title": "MAN IN THE NEWS: Okorocha, the captain of 'iberiberism', juggles presidential bid and fraud charges",
          "text": "Rochas Okorocha is getting media attention. Not only the gleeful basking that comes with positive coverage that he had expected when he styled himself \u201cCaptain Rochas\u201d who is ready to be the \u201cpilot for a new Nigeria\u201d as he formally declared his presidential ambition on Monday. But also scalding reportage scrutinising his alleged involvement in the N2.9billion fraud charges levelled against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The 17-count charge surfaced just a few hours after he stood before reporters to proclaim himself \u201cnot too old to run\u201d.\n\nAccording to the EFCC, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds.\n\nAside from Okorocha, other defendants in the case are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited.\n\nIn response, Okorocha dismissed the charges as \u201cpolitical propaganda\u201d designed to tarnish his image. He boasted that he had garnered riches long before foraying into politics, adding that he became \u201cpoorer\u201d while he was governor of Imo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to say to you that I was Rochas before I became governor; in fact, [being a] governor made me poorer,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cHow much is Imo state government money? Imo state is really owing me because I never collected my security votes. I am supposed to collect N8 billion if I have to make claims for security votes I did not collect.\u201d\n\nOkorocha is not new to controversies that beam negative media reportage on him. In fact, since his departure from the Imo state government house, controversy has trailed him like an ants stalk sugar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBERIBERISM\n\nIn a chat with Channels TV in 2019, Okorocha pulled on the cap of an etymologist and the pen of a lexicographer \u2014 and minted a new English word. \u201cIberiberism,\u201d he called it while claiming it can be found in English language dictionaries.\n\n\u201cWhy do we fight corruption? I\u2019ll rather prevent corruption than fight it. That\u2019s one that my party [APC] should look into. Because people are getting away with corruption on the basis that they can perfect their paperwork,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut if you come to Imo, and I\u2019ve collected N500billion, and I can only show you boreholes and renovation of schools, and I can tidy them up. It\u2019s what I call Iberiberism.\n\n\u201cGo and search for it. It\u2019s an English word. Go and check the dictionary for it. Iberiberism means foolishness.\u201d\n\nThe newly-fangled word earned Okorocha some attention with the press and on social media, where he became the subject of memes for a while.\n\nERECTING OF STATUES\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTowards the twilight of his tenure as the governor of Imo state, Okorocha embarked on a spree of statue erections to \u201cpreserve history which is dying in Africa\u201d.\n\nWithin a few months, he unveiled giant-sized bronze statues of Jacob Zuma, Sirleaf Johnson, Kwame Nkrumah, Olusegun Obasanjo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Martin Luther King Jnr, Alex Ekwueme, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutrage trailed the unveiling \u2014 particularly of Zuma who was facing corruption allegations in South Africa.\n\nIn defence, Okorocha said he splurged N530 million to immortalise the African icons \u201cso that children yet unborn can know about them\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI erect statues to immortalise people so that children yet unborn can know about them. History is dying in Africa. We must keep it alive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the next 100 years, most of us would not be alive, but this will stand for children to see. If leaders are not immortalised, there will be no history for children.\u201d\n\nMINISTRY OF HAPPINESS\n\nIn 2017, while he was still facing fierce criticism for his statues erecting move, Okorocha gave his detractors yet another rope to hang him with. He created the ministry of happiness and purpose fulfilment for the people of Imo and appointed Ogechi Ololo, his sister, as the pioneer commissioner.\n\nThe announcement was greeted with loads of mockery on social media after the initial name of the ministry was erroneously printed as \u201cministry of happiness and couple fulfilment\u201d. People were perplexed at the function of the new ministry and why it was needed, and Okorocha, as usual, had the answers ready.\n\n\u201cThe real essence of life is to be happy and to fulfil one\u2019s purpose in life. Government officials are elected to address this,\u201d he has said in a statement released by Sam Onwueomedo, his spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThis is the very reason people elect their leaders to guarantee their happiness and purpose fulfilment. A great leader, therefore, is one who provides happiness to the people.\u201d\n\nPOWER TUSSLE WITH HOPE UZODINMA\n\nSince leaving office as the governor of Imo in 2019, Okorocha has been at loggerheads with Hope Uzodinma, his successor.\n\nThe duo had over the past months traded libellous and unsavoury comments and allegations.\n\nThe verbal scuffle reached a crescendo last December when Uche Nwosu, Okorocha\u2019s in-law and his anointed candidate for the 2019 Imo gubernatorial election, was arrested by security operatives during a church thanksgiving service in honour of his late mother, Jemaimah Nwosu, who was laid to rest just a few days before.\n\nWitnesses had earlier described the arrest as an abduction until the police announced its involvement later in the day.\n\nIn reaction, Okorocha said the incident was \u201clike a kidnap\u201d. He added that his son-in-law\u2019s arrest has \u201cunravelled\u201d the \u201cmystery\u201d behind unknown gunmen in Imo.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL BID\n\nIn 2021, it became clear that Okorocha might have his eyes fixed on the presidency. Coalitions across the country began clamouring for him to declare his interest in the 2023 presidential election. According to the proponents of his candidacy, he \u201cremains the best ticket that can guarantee the Igbo\u2019s push for the presidency in 2023\u201d.\n\nDuring a plenary session in January 2022, Okorocha, in what appeared to be acceding to the request, announced his intention to run for president.\n\nA few days later, he formally declared his bid to reporters in Abuja.\n\nOkorocha said his ambition is inspired by the need to establish a \u201cnew Nigeria\u201d where issues of poverty and security will be addressed.\n\n\u201cI am not in politics for what I can get. I am in politics for what I can give. I price honour more than life and glory more than wealth,\u201d he had said.\n\nIn a chat with Arise TV on Tuesday, he said his background as a \u201cbusinessman\u201d would help to solve Nigeria\u2019s wealth creation problems.\n\n\u201cNigeria has so many problems than the available money can solve. We need to create wealth, that\u2019s why I said that we need a businessman. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be deceived by anybody who doesn\u2019t know how to make wealth,\u201d the former Imo governor said.\n\n\u201cAspiration is not the issue of grammar or technicalities. It\u2019s the ability to make wealth. We need business ideas to run this country.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s saddled with not only the rigour of being a presidential hopeful but also a suspect in a fraud case, how Okorocha will juggle the two burdens is something that requires pondering.",

          "text": "Venture capital investments into startups in Africa hit a record high in 2021 as companies raised over $4.3 billion in venture capital (VC) investments \u2013 2.5x the amount raised in 2020.

          "text": "Globally, cryptocurrency industry funding has been growing increasingly fast in the past couple of years. Last year alone, crypto startups raised over $27 billion in venture capital in 2021 \u2014slightly higher than the past 10 years combined. And just last month, despite a dip in the price of cryptocurrencies, American VC, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm launched a $2.2 billion fund, one of its biggest efforts to fund crypto startups. The firm is reaffirming its commitment to crypto with its third and largest industry specific fund, after investing $850 million last year between 2 rounds of investments. This shows that institutional investors are getting more comfortable in putting their money in crypto\u2014an entirely different experience 4 or 5 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, Web3\u2014powered by crypto, is becoming a large industry, and it is not surprising because Africa is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world, consequently, investors are pumping money into the industry on the continent.\n\nOn a mission to further deepen crypto adoption in Africa is Nigerian crypto startup Nestcoin which is building out Web3 products. Today, Nestcoin announced that it raised a $6.5 million pre-seed round. Since launching last year, in November, with a promise to \u201chelp Nigerians first, then other Africans, exit the status quo by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi,\u201d Nestcoin has made tremendous progress.\n\nFounded by former Binance director Yele Bademosi and former Bundle Africa CTO, Taiwo Orilogbon, Nestcoin has made good on its promise to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nLast year, it launched Breach, a media arm to simplify complex crypto topics to a global audience. It later launched one of Africa\u2019s earliest play-to-earn crypto games, Metaverse Magna (MVM), which it says will allow members of its gaming community to earn as much as $1,000 monthly. It has invested in Lazerpay, a crypto startup that allows businesses to accept payment in crypto, and collaborated with fintech, Bitsika and its music superstar partner Davido to launch the Echoke social token. Nescoin has hinted that it is developing several other products to \u201cprovide compelling use cases for crypto\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that our investors are backing this ambitious plan to create a future where billions of people in frontier markets have access to the opportunities that crypto brings. With this financing, we will continue to grow our diverse team, which already spans 9 countries, expand our product offerings, and invest in more ventures aligned with our vision,\u201d says Nestcoin\u2019s CEO, Yele Bademosi, in a statement.\n\nThe company, which boasts of a global network of investors, had its round led by Distributed Global, Alter Global, Serena Ventures, Alameda Research, and A&T Capital. Other institutional investors include MSA Capital, 4DX Ventures, Raba Capital, Goat.vc, Old Fashion Research, CMT Digital, Electric Capital, Social Capital, CoinFund, gumi Cryptos Capital, DeFi Alliance, among others.\n\nNestcoin, in a statement, says that the new funding will enable it to expand its global operations and invest in building products that will help accelerate crypto adoption and financial freedom for people in frontier markets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tiger Global and Greycroft lead $15m Series A round in Nigeria\u2019s Bamboo",
          "text": "Bamboo, an investment platform that allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by American venture capital firms Greycroft and Tiger Global. Motley Fool Ventures, Saison Capital, Chrysalis Capital, and Y-Combinator\u2019s Michael Seibel also participated in the round, the company said.\n\nLaunched in January 2020 by CEO Richmond Bassey and COO Yanmo Omorogbe, Bamboo has rapidly grown in popularity with retail investors, claiming over 300,000 accounts in Nigeria. Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Untapped Global wants to fund African startups using data from IoT devices",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump aggressively pursued an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy as he sought to \u201creturn\u201d the US to its place as the dominant power in the world. Consequently, there was a reduction in aid to developing countries.\n\nIn 2021, the United Kingdom also announced that aid to African countries would be reduced by 66%. This followed a trend of less money in aid flowing to developing countries, including African countries.\n\nFor a long time, discussions about development in Africa usually revolved around aids. That approach has not particularly paid off, with experts believing it has fostered a culture of dependency. However, African tech seems to be changing all that with venture-backed investments increasing due to amazing levels of innovation across the continent.\n\nAs a volunteer in Nigeria with Doctors Without Borders \u2014 a non-profit organisation committed to providing medical personnel to underserved areas \u2014 Jim Chu believed that volunteering with development organisations was his way of impacting the world. However, he soon realised that helping businesses access the funds they need to grow their operations was a better option. That realisation led him to start Untapped Global in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe created Untapped to fill a hole that I saw as an investor and as an entrepreneur over and over again in Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, and other places. Some people call that hole \u2018The valley of death\u2019 or \u2018The missing level\u2019, but it\u2019s the space where you\u2019re no longer a very early startup, but you\u2019re also not a very well established company. You\u2019re in-between, and companies at this stage find it difficult to raise capital; it\u2019s even harder if you\u2019re outside the traditional investment thesis,\u201d Chu says.\n\nDemocratising prosperity using smart asset financing\n\nWith most venture capital going to companies that can scale at astronomical rates, such as fintech, other companies find it challenging to raise funds even though they can create great value. Untapped Global was founded to fill this gap. Unlike typical investment strategies, Untapped Global funds assets that can create economic value.\n\nFor example, imagine a young man, Taiwo, from a village in Southern Nigeria, who has just moved to Lagos. Without an education, he is unable to get a good job. Also, his lack of credit history means he cannot get a loan to start a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexClub is one of Untapped Global\u2019s portfolio companies\n\nUsing data from IoT devices, a company backed by Untapped Global could give Taiwo a tricycle for commercial transportation. The tricycle would be monitored to know how well Taiwo utilises this asset. If he does not use it profitably, the company retrieves it and gives it to someone else. Untapped Global invests in these companies and, in return, receives a percentage of the business\u2019 revenue.\n\nChu explains how Untapped Global works.\n\n\u201cThe conventional way of managing risk is, \u2018Show me your balance sheets. Show me the assets you have.\u2019 So you have a house, and you take a loan against the house, and we sign a lot of papers so that if you don\u2019t pay me back, we send a lot of lawyers to make sure you pay me back or I take over your house.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has a house or asset that can be collateralised, but everyone has the energy. So what we do, instead, is we use data to say, \u2018Okay, you don\u2019t have a house, but you can drive a motorcycle. The asset we give you is the motorcycle, and we use IoT to track that motorcycle using the data you generate from it to manage the risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the firm does not only use smart asset financing as an investment tool, having made equity investments in startups like Opibus, an electric vehicle company in Kenya; Nigerian fintech startup, Paga; Flexclub, a car financing company in South Africa; Eden Life; OnePipe; Inspira Farms; and Asaak, a company providing financing services for motorbikes in Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much does Untapped Global invest?\n\nWith a slightly different investment model, Untapped Global has no average ticket size. Instead, it invests between $50,000 and $3 million in its portfolio companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no average ticket size because our due diligence process is tied up in the ticket sizes,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Water ATM in Kenya\n\nTypically, after a company indicates interest in being funded by an investor, the investor carries out a due diligence process to ascertain if the company is worth investing in. Untapped Global does this differently.\n\nInstead of a regular due diligence process, the firm launches a pilot where it finances a business\u2019 assets, starting with $50,000 or more. The pilot could last for a few weeks, and they make an investment decision based on the data gotten from the process.\n\nBiggest mistakes startups make\n\nDeciding to start a business is signing up for uncertainty. As a result, even the most experienced founders could make mistakes. Chu believes that one of the biggest mistakes African founders make is not knowing what type of capital they need for their business.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of startup founders make the mistake of using equity capital when they should be using non-dilutive debt or other kinds of non-equity capital to run their business. If you\u2019re a software startup, you don\u2019t need that much CapEx, but if you\u2019re an asset-heavy company using equity investments, you\u2019re going to run out of cap table at some point.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn bad investments, missed opportunities, and successes\n\nEven with strict adherence to a due diligence process, venture financing can still go wrong. With several businesses not making it to the five-year mark, many businesses funded by venture capitalists are likely to fail. Untapped Global\u2019s unconventional investment methods means that it could detect a bad investment within weeks by testing the waters before making a permanent commitment.\n\n\u201cOur data helps us to detect a bad investment in as little as a few weeks, and because we give out small amounts of money, we can cut off the financing whenever we like,\u201d Chu reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, traditional VC firms may have to wait a few months before realising that an investment won\u2019t go according to plan. While Untapped Global has been funding startups for barely two years, Chu lists FlexClub, Paga, and Asaak as some of their biggest successes.\n\nMost investors in Africa invest in various industries, but Chu says Untapped Global is focused on mobility, water infrastructure, and energy. Its investment method also means that its investments are not tied to particular funding rounds.\n\nSo, if you have a business that already generates revenue in any of these industries, you can apply to get funded by sending an email to deals@untappedglobal.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nAfrican startups have picked up where they left off in 2021 regarding funding. January gave us the first $100m+ round as InstaDeep raised $100 million. With over $4.3 billion raised in 2021, the bar is set very high, but only a few will bet against African startups living up to last year\u2019s numbers.\n\nSo, today we\u2019re discussing:\n\nBuilding a pipeline for African tech talent\n\nImproving digital lending through tech\n\nSimplifying the blockchain\n\nAmitruck\u2019s plans for East Africa\n\nBuilding a pipeline for entry-level tech talent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were given a dollar for every time an African startup founder complained of difficulty hiring software engineers, you would be sitting on a small fortune in no time. The truth is, it\u2019s hard to hire for any role in Africa, thanks to an educational system still stuck in the 60s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrow in that software engineers essentially work with programming languages roughly 30 years old, and you can understand why it is challenging to hire for technical roles.\n\nSo what\u2019s been done about it? Depending on who you ask, a lot or very little. Startups like Andela (for a few years), Decagon, Gebeya, amongst others, have created training programmes for software engineers, but that is not nearly enough.\n\nThe U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the demand for software engineers will grow 22% between 2020 to 2030. This is significantly higher than the 4% projected for other careers.\n\nOver the last few years, the focus has been on senior engineers, but there will always be a need for entry-level and mid-level engineers. Armed with this knowledge, AltSchool Africa is building a pipeline for entry-level talent in Africa.\n\nYesterday, the startup announced that it had raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from investors, including Paystack Founder, Shola Akinlade; Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Pledges; ODBA VC; Nestcoin; Nigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz); and rapper, Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter).\n\nRead more: Techpoint Pitchstorm alumnus, AltSchool Africa bags $1m pre-seed to plug Africa\u2019s shortage of entry-level talent\n\nImproving digital lending through data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYvonne Johnson, CEO and Co-founder, Indicina.

Without going into the details of how they got my contact details, this is a far cry from what the lending landscape looked like only a few years ago.\n\nFor a long time, minimal lending was done by financial institutions in Nigeria. When it happened, it was often after a lengthy process that could discourage applicants. In addition, you needed collateral to guarantee that you received your loan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter fintech startups.\n\nUsing machine learning, fintech startups changed the way the game was played.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2017, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbanjo, signed two bills into law: the Secured Transactions in Movable Assets Acts (Collateral Registry Act), 2017 and the Credit Reporting Act, 2017.\n\nFor Bayode*, a struggling painter in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, this meant that he could register his movable assets \u2014 like his Toyota Lexus 2009 or his secondhand Syinix Single Door Fridge \u2014 on the National Collateral Registry as collateral to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIt also meant that because of the Credit Reporting Act, if he had previously taken a loan from any lending institution, his information would be available to serve as credit history for him in subsequent loan applications.\n\nA year later, in 2018, Techpoint Africa found that the Credit Reporting Act was already being implemented, although not in real-time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, like so many laws before them, the two laws were not solving the problem they were meant to \u2014 helping to provide credit history information for banks and lending institutions while improving the credit score of the average Nigerian.\n\nWith its API-based platform, Nigerian fintech, Indicina, has set out to solve this problem by building products that enable lenders throughout the credit lifecycle. From when loans are requested to decisioning, disbursement, and collection.\n\nEnter Indicina\n\nAfter her stint at First Bank leading the strategy department, Yvonne Johnson, Indicina Co-founder and CEO, thought it was time to step back and solve the consumer lending gap challenge in Nigeria.\n\nWith a degree in computer science and mathematics from the University of Toronto and a belief that technology is a powerful tool to solve this market\u2019s biggest financial challenges, she founded Indicina in 2018 with her Co-founders, Yemi Ajao, Jacob Ayokunle, and Carlos del Carpio.\n\nIndicina uses a data-driven approach to help lending institutions provide credit underwriting at scale. Using artificial intelligence, the company gives insights on future customers and de-risking unsecured loans. This also empowers lenders to drive new uses of data beyond predicting default, for example, managing churn, and marketing campaigns, among others.\n\nAccording to Johnson, \u201cIndicina does not have a balance sheet or compete on lending. We offer API-driven software to digitise the lending business. Our flagship product, Originate, is an analytics-driven approach to lending. It empowers clients to unpack the credit value chain and digitise each step, including identity verification, credit decisioning/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\u201d\n\nEmploying a Software as a service (SaaS) model, the company makes its money by providing B2B2C solutions to lending institutions \u2014 bank and non-bank. From what Johnson tells us, this enables wider distribution by allowing for a more cost-effective adoption of their technology.\n\nBut what separates Indicina from competitors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndicina\u2019s competitive advantage is a deep understanding of the financial services industry across key emerging markets \u2013 LatAm, Africa, and Asia. We understand the business of credit and how technology \u2013 specifically end-to-end credit journeys \u2013 can drive the profitability of consumer loan portfolios.\n\n\u201cInnovation has placed demands on traditional lending business models. How do you expand consumer credit to under-/unbanked populations in a prudent manner while shortening time-to-decision? Taking a cue from FinTechs, leading banks have embraced the digital-lending revolution, bringing \u201ctime to yes\u201d down to five minutes, and time to cash to less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nWith Indicina\u2019s API that gives lending institutions access to this essential data, Johnson believes their business model is quite solid.

          "text": "The scramble to accelerate economic growth in Africa following the pandemic-induced slump will be swift if countries in the continent utilise local resources, trade, and technological advancement.\n\nTop industry experts unanimously agreed Tuesday at the ongoing Africa Business Convention 2022 organised by BusinessDay that the African continent needs to explore emerging opportunities and be updated with global trends and developments to abate the impact of the pandemic, leveraging trade and technology.\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria\u2019s country director, World Bank, said Africa needs to explore options to attract investments and grow its trade portfolio to achieve accelerated recovery post-pandemic.\n\nMore than a year after signing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, countries in the continent with a GDP size of over $2.69 trillion are yet to start reaping from the initiative that could place Africa as one of the world\u2019s power economies.\n\nFor example, exports from Nigeria, the continent\u2019s largest and most populous nation, to Africa fell by 25 percent in the first six months of 2021 compared with the same period the previous year. This decline in African exports sufficed despite the commencement of AfCFTA in January 2021.\n\nMost of Africa, according to Shadrack Kubyane, co-founder, Coronet Blockchain, SA, is built around extraction not synergy, and as a result, the continent was now faced with an infrastructure deficit across the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot easier to move things from China and Europe into Africa than it is to move things within Africa, and we need to repair that,\u201d he said.\n\nTo solve the problem, the blockchain expert said the solution does not revolve around infrastructure rather government policies to probe innovation.\n\n\u201cWe need a mindset shift for a successful free trade. Africa cannot continue to maintain the ideology that the winner takes all to repair trade in the continent. Countries need a mindset shift; also, blockchain is creating a level playing ground for all players in African trade, especially MSMEs,\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Elebute, chairman, KPMG Africa, believes countries in Africa cannot maximise the trade agreement exchanging commodities in raw forms, saying, \u201cAfrican countries need to learn how to attract the market, boost capacity for manufacturing, and increase value addition practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chairperson of the Netherlands-based institution, an alternative to the exchange of commodities is manufactured products. \u201cUnfortunately, the local manufacturing sector has not fared well over time, which calls for the need to put in place enabling policies and infrastructure for manufacturing outfits to thrive,\u201d Elebute said.\n\nTo improve trade relationships, Kelvin Uwaibi, managing director, Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), said sub-nationals in African states must commence trade with each other, as this will fuel the drive to trade across the region.\n\n\u201cSub-nationals need to look at how they can start to produce locally and also trade with each other. Interstate trading should be groomed before going to the continent,\u201d he said.\n\nKubyane said too much bureaucracy interferes with African international trade, which affects the process and discourages participation.\n\nTechnology is the tool that could serve as the one currency needed to bridge the lapses faced by trading in Africa, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, the founder of Patricia Technology, said.\n\n\u201cThe blockchain and cryptocurrency already solved the problem of one currency in the continent, we just need to tap into it,\u201d Agbodje said, adding that technological innovations were what was needed to ease the pains of smooth trading in Africa.\n\nAcknowledging that the innovations around blockchain and the likes are disruptive and which was the case when the internet, railways, and others were first established, the industry players said Africa needs to visit the \u2018dentist.\u2019 In this case, the \u2018dentist\u2019 is the blockchain.\n\n\u201cFor us to move upward and forward, we need to be a bit uncomfortable and face the truth,\u201d Kubyane said.\n\nStill recovering from the impact of COVID-19, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects sub-Saharan Africa to grow at 3.8 percent in 2022, higher than the 2.7 percent growth projection for Nigeria.\n\nWhile the impact of the pandemic can be easily blamed for the slow growth in Africa, especially in some of its biggest economies like Nigeria, an evaluation of micro-economic indicators of the continent\u2019s largest economy before the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, shows the recent challenges only made what was already a bad situation worse.\n\nLagos State governor, Babajide Sanwoolu, in his opening remarks at the Business Convention described the pandemic as a dangerous virus that was yet to be completely managed.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to develop capacity and establish the necessary infrastructure, which will create buffers against such occurrences in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining how some of today\u2019s world power economies were able to scale economic growth and development, Birgitte Andersen, founder/CEO, Big Innovation Centre, UK, said China, for example, managed to get 800 million people out of extreme poverty in 30 years by focusing on infrastructure development. With a different approach, she said India focused on the supply chain and became a supply chain to the rest of the world. The US, according to her, focused on the internet revolution and talent system. Europe leverages big companies to become catalysts and accelerators. The Middle East focused on real estate and the building of big cities.\n\n\u201cLooking at Africa from the outside, it can get everybody online and be able to create a system. It can look at the talent to generate growth and it can leverage the AI system to achieve its goals,\u201d she said.\n\nThe World Bank is of the view that increased investment in human capital translates to higher economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to understand why countries should invest in human capital (HC) and protect hard-won gains from being eroded,\u201d the World Bank economists said in a report.\n\nKingsley Moghalu, founder, Sagato Strategies LLC and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said at the BusinessDay Africa Convention that Nigeria needed to change its education curriculum to one that will be based on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\n\u201cWe need to have a leader who can relate to younger people and has a passion for their future,\u201d he said.

          "title": "How zoning may disrupt 2023 electoral process",
          "text": "Depending on how Nigeria\u2019s major political parties decide on their choice of presidential candidates, observers say the polity could be heated up as the issue of zoning has been a sensitive and contentious one that could disrupt the 2023 electoral process.\n\nWith just about a year to the 2023 general election, one of the key issues that has dominated discussion across Nigeria, in recent times, is perhaps zoning, which raises questions as to the region that should produce a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nNigeria\u2019s two major political parties, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have not taken a categorical stand on which section of the country their presidential ticket would be zoned. However, the issue has been on the front burner and may go a long way in shaping permutations in the coming months ahead of the presidential primaries.\n\nSince the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1999, there has been a rotation of the presidency between the South and the North as was practiced during the 16-year rule of the PDP.\n\nThough not constitutionally backed, political leaders say that due to the heterogeneous nature of the country, power rotation arrangements had become necessary to address complaints of marginalisation and domination and to give equal power to Nigeria\u2019s various ethnic groups.\n\nThere are some Nigerians who are of the view that citizens should rather vote for competence than consider the region where the candidate hails from.\n\nFormer military dictator, Ibrahim Babangida and President Buhari\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, had, in recent time, openly kicked against power rotation, saying the arrangement had failed and that there was no need to zone the 2023 presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\nThey had argued that rather than zoning the ticket, competence should be given priority in the choice of the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a choice either we want to practice democracy the way it should be practised or the way it is being practised, or we define democracy according to our own whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to do it the way it is done all over the world you allow the process to continue, it is through the process that you will be able to come up with a candidate that will lead the country,\u201d Babangida said.\n\nBut political leaders from the South, especially South-Eastern Nigeria, have consistently insisted that power must rotate to the region after the two terms of eight years of President Buhari in 2023.\n\nThey argue that to save the country from crisis, political parties and politicians must allow the South-East to produce the country\u2019s president in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is no region that does not have competent people to preside over Nigeria. If the country can survive the current leadership for close to seven years now, there is no leader that would be as disastrous. The country may be thrown into a serious crisis in the next few weeks if this issue of zoning is not well addressed,\u201d a source, who craved anonymity, said.\n\nLeaders of the apex Igbo social-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, had warned political parties that the region would only support and vote for the party that fielded a presidential candidate from the South-East.\n\nLast week, the group rejected former Vice President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s proposed single four-year tenure if elected as president in 2023, in which a candidate from the region would be his running mate, describing Atiku\u2019s proposal as a hoax.\n\nOhanaeze secretary-general, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said the remark was a collective disrespect to the people of the South-East, declaring that Igbos will reject the vice-presidential slot, stressing that the region should be allowed to produce a president in 2023.\n\nSpeaking recently in an interview with BusinessDay, Chekwas Okorie, a former national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), warned that the two major parties in the South-East were tired of being used and abandoned.\n\nHe said it would not accept any position other than the presidency from the two major parties, saying, \u201cWe have resolved that any party that gives the presidential ticket to Igbo man in 2023 would get the votes of Igbos massively across the country and that is our priority ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cEverything looks favourable for the South to be considered for the APC ticket. But when you now talk about the South, the Yoruba\u2019s have had their turn when Obasanjo ruled for eight years, after that we had Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan tenure, we know that Jonathan moved on to rule for six years.\n\n\u201cSo, it is only the South-East and, for the interest of equity, it is appropriate that the region gets the president slot in 2023. But the way I am seeing it, the PDP may not zone the presidency to the South-East in 2023.\u201d\n\nSimilar sentiment has been shared in the South-West among some political leaders who say that the region deserved to produce Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cIt is the Yoruba turn to rule after Buhari; I know power would be zoned back to the South, but I don\u2019t agree when you say it is South-East time. I don\u2019t see APC giving the ticket to someone from that region,\u201d a chieftain of the APC said.\n\nIn the meantime, it is apparent the two major parties are playing a hide-and-seek game on each other in terms of where their presidential ticket would be zoned.\n\nImpeccable sources within the two leading parties indicate that despite efforts from several top party leaders for the presidential ticket to be zoned to a particular region, it may be thrown open for anyone interested to contest.\n\nRead also: 2023: Shuaibu endorses Osinbajo for president\n\nIn the last few months, several individuals have publicly declared their interest to vie for the nation\u2019s number one seat in the two major parties, some of the aspirants are: Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, Anyim Pius Anyim, former Senate president, Samuel Ohuabunwa and Kingsley Moghalu former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), among others.\n\nHowever, observers say that for the sake of equity and fairness, to give everyone a sense of belonging it is important that regions that had not produced a president since the return to democracy in 1999 should be given a chance.\n\nSuch a view was shared by Adelaja Adeoye, former national publicity secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), noting that it would be unjust to continue to deny the South-East and North-Central the presidency when other regions had their chance to rule.\n\nAccording to Adeoye, \u201cOur focus should be on character, the capacity and competency of the person. However, one of the attributes can be found in any zone. For the fact that Buhari has stayed for eight years and the North-West have ruled, Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan also ruled, meaning that the South-East have not been given opportunity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAll the actors must calm down and give South-East and North-Central a chance to rule the country. What we do today would come back and wait for us tomorrow, so that we can move the country forward.\u201d",

          "text": "The lack of investible assets to deploy growing pension funds has confined Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to allocate a substantial proportion of their funds to fixed income securities month-on-month/year-on-year.\n\nThis lack of asset class for investment the pension managers complained is not allowing them to grow their assets in a way to yield greater returns to the benefit of the contributors and retirees.\n\nNational Pension Commission\u2019s (PenCom) monthly report of October 2021 shows that out of N13.2 trillion in Assets Under Management by the PFAs 71.2 percent is in fixed income securities.\n\nAnalysts at FBNQuest Capital say the asset allocation of Nigerian pension funds has generally been biased toward government debt.\n\nAccording to the agency, this is due to the scarcity of good investible securities available to them.\n\nGiven the further breakdown of the report as released by PenCom, assets under management of the PFAs grew by 9 percent year-on-year to N13.2 trillion, equal to $31.7 billion and 1 percent month-on-month as at the end of October 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen we include corporate and state government issuance, we find fixed-income exposure equivalent to 71.2 percent of the industry\u2019s AUM. FGN bonds accounted for over 60 percent of PFAs\u2019 asset allocation,\u201d according to FBNQuest.\n\nMaking a comparison with a similar scheme in Kenya, FBNQuest Capital notes that in its June \u201921 report, the Kenyan Retirement Benefit Authority recorded that government securities accounted for 44.1 percent of its KES1.48 trillion, which is N12.97 billion AUM of the Kenyan pension industry.\n\n\u201cThe value of domestic equities in PFA portfolios increased by 29 percent over the 12-month period, bringing the share of equities in the portfolio up to 6.9 percent from around 5.8 percent a year earlier.\u201d\n\nFBNQuest Capital says with respect to equities, Nigerian PFAs have adopted a cautious approach, having taken some losses during the stock market meltdown of 2008 to 2009.\n\nAnother noteworthy point is that despite the NGX market capitalisation of over $60 billion, selecting high-quality, liquid shares that fit the investment criteria of PFAs are extremely limited, FBNQuest states.\n\nThe agency says it has seen that over the course of a year, PFAs have cut their holdings of Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTB) from N653 billion to N280 billion, stating that it is due to depressed (low-single-digit) yields on the NTBs.\n\nThis is as yields on FGN bonds retraced by well over 500bps across the curve between Q4 \u201920 and Q3 \u201921.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, the Debt Management Office (DMO) has an onerous domestic borrowing target of N2.57 trillion this year. This target does not take into consideration the supplementary budget meant to cover the N3 trillion for subsidy payments by the NNPC.\u201d\n\nAs such, we see yields rising again this year on account of increased supply of paper from the DMO, FBNQuest Capital states.\n\nWale Odutola, chairman, Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp) giving operators focus for 2022, says PFAs are committed to diversifying their investment portfolios for increased returns on investment and greater impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cConversations are ongoing in these areas with identified segments, and these will be deepened in the New Year,\u201d Odutola states.\n\nRead also: 3 questions to ask before choosing a Pension Fund Administrator (PFA)\n\nAfrican Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (AVCA) and PenOp in a recent report identified desire, and how diversification of asset classes will continue to drive investment in private equities (PEs), over the next five years.\n\nAccording to the report, 75 percent of the pension fund managers that participated in the survey plan to accelerate or maintain their current pace of capital commitments to African PE in the next five years, citing a desire for portfolio diversification and performance as the most important factors driving their investment plans.\n\nAlthough there has been a concerted effort by both sets of industries to increase the level of pension allocation to private equity, the allocation of Nigeria\u2019s pension funds to the asset class has traditionally been low when compared to their allowable limits.\n\nThe release of this flagship report, according to the partners, aims to bridge the gap between these two complementary industries by investigating and assessing the role of Nigerian pension funds in empowering local investors in Nigeria\u2019s PE industry.\n\nSpeaking on the publication, Abi Mustapha-Maduakor, CEO of AVCA, says increasing interest in Africa\u2019s PE industry from domestic and international investors alike underscores the need to analyse the perceptions and concerns of institutional investors to promote an open dialogue on the continent\u2019s unique business environment.\n\nOguche Agudah, CEO of PenOp, states that local pension funds have expressed a desire to increase their allocation to PE and more impactful investments.",

That is why I personally appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari when it became clear that he was in the process of creating six more colleges of education. For us, we were very specific that we wanted a college of education that will train teachers in technical subjects because that aligns with our plans as a government.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to retool the educational system of this country and Edo State. Today, we can proudly say that we have started an educational revolution in Edo. The children being produced from our basic educational system today, in terms of literacy, almost peer with their mates globally and the records are there.\u201d\n\nAssuring the NCCE delegation on the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the school kicks off academic activities despite the antics of some detractors, Obaseki noted, \u201cThat school was shut down five years ago; it was shut down for us to start a university. The same trouble that led to the shutdown of that school is what they are trying to make with this new one. They frustrated the school for making progress and they want to frustrate this school too from making progress.\n\n\u201cThey are claiming what they didn\u2019t work for because we have set up our own state college of education. When we built our own school, they said we should absorb them into our new school.\n\n\u201cDuring my reelection, they were acting as active politicians, but we cannot sacrifice the future of our children for their selfish gains. They claimed that we owe them, but it is not true. Till tomorrow, they cannot give you the evidence of the school fees they have collected, but we can show you the evidence of subversions we have put in the school.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey have tried to go to court; they\u2019ve done a lot of publications, and now it\u2019s just blackmailing and as a government, we won\u2019t subject ourselves to blackmails. Even yesterday, they wrote me a letter of apology. But they\u2019ve gone back, front, left, right, and centre. But as a government, we remain focused. We know where we are going and if they have legitimate claims by now they would have gone to court to get court orders.\n\n\u201cWhy have they not opted for that option? Why are they going to barricade the road and embarrass people who want to inspect the facilities? For us, I think this is a politically-motivated action and I don\u2019t think it has a legal basis to stop what we want to do.\n\n\u201cIf they feel they\u2019ve been disenfranchised; they should go to court. We, as a government, will always obey court orders. So, whatever cooperation you need from me, we will give you. We\u2019ve fought tough political battles; hence, this one is a joke. We\u2019ve brought godfathers down and if the godfathers have gone back to mobilize them, they are just joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t stop the education and future of our children. We will provide whatever support and cooperation that the federal government needs to ensure that this school can be opened to enable us to begin to train our teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Secretary of NCCE, Prof. Paulinus Okwelle, expressed appreciation to the governor for providing infrastructure for the take-off of the school.\n\nHe added: \u201cOnce again, we congratulate you for attracting this new federal institution to Edo. In 2019, President Buhari approved six colleges of education in each zone and the one in Ekiadolor to serve the South-South. We\u2019ve gone round the site of the college and discovered a lot of good things and we must appreciate your efforts.\u201d.\n\n...",

About 173 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this month, an unconfirmed number of children were reportedly abducted in Pemi, another community in the Chibok LGA.\n\n\u201cUNICEF is very relieved for the released girls and their families,\u2019\u2019 added Peter Hawkins, UNICEF representative in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAfter their harrowing experience, it is good news that the girls are back with their families and friends, where they belong. But sadly, dozens of children in north-east Nigeria remain in captivity; the victims of an armed conflict they have nothing to do with. This is unconscionable. Children have the right to a safe environment, health, education and freedom from abuse and torture \u2013 all of which remain compromised when they are in captivity,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Hawkins.\n\n\u201cChildren are not the spoils of conflict. All children in captivity must be immediately and safely released to their families,\u2019\u2019 Hawkins added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to UNICEF, children in Nigeria continue to face unprecedented violations of their rights, including abductions, torture, killings, recruitment into armed groups, and forced marriages, among other abuses of their rights. In the North-East, more than 1,000 children have been abducted since 2014, with at least 100 still missing or unaccounted for.\n\nBetween December and July 2021, at least 1,450 children were abducted, most from their schools, across central and north-west regions of the country.",

          "title": "Buhari Launches N62bn HIV Trust Fund",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja launched a N62billion Trust Fund to help Nigeria end AIDS as a public health threat and place more people living with HIV on treatment annually.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria (HTFN), the President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, pledged that his administration would continue to prioritise health interventions to address killer diseases and public health emergencies.\n\n\u201dAt the last United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, I made a call for a renewed global action to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\n\u201dEnding AIDS as a public health threat in Nigeria will require increased domestic funding. We have continued to make good our commitment of placing more people living with HIV on treatment annually using national resources.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dHowever, strong domestic resource mobilization with an enduring partnership and shared responsibility is required to sustain the response to HIV and other emerging public health emergencies,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s purposeful partnership with the private sector in the response to COVID-19 pandemic had provided a readily available financing solution to leverage on to sustain the HIV response.\n\nHe commended the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) and the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS for their efforts in establishing the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria to secure a generation of babies free of HIV.\n\nHe also expressed delight with the attendance in person of notable global key players in HIV response and from the private sector at the event and the pledges made.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dGoing forward, I hope The HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria will galvanize more of the private sector and other partners to surpass the target of Sixty-Two Billion Naira in the next five years,\u201d the President added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, announced that since 2005, about $6.2 billion has been spent on HIV response in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dAbout 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors, mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Private Sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nAcknowledging NACA\u2019s efforts to promote resource mobilisation to complement existing external support, Mustapha said the Federal Government has sustained the treatment and financing of 50,000 PLHIV annually.\n\nHe said the launch of the HTFN will guarantee funding from the private sector-led resources for HIV interventions especially for the elimination of the Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dSince 2005, about 6.2 billion dollars has been spent on HIV response in Nigeria about 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Private Sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government,\u201d SGF added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChief launcher and chairman/CEO of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, said the mission of the private sector-led fund proposed by NACA alongside the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS (NiBUCAA) was to ensure mobilisation of resources towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, starting with the prevention of Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dI am reminded that we have 2 million of our compatriots living with HIV/AIDS and it is our collective responsibility to bring this number down to zero,\u201d the business mogul said.\n\nDangote, who is Africa\u2019s richest man, appealed to individuals and corporate organisations in the country to donate generously toward the Fund, currently chaired by Dr Herbert Wigwe, the Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc.\n\n\u201dWe would like the private sector to work in partnership with the Federal Government on a 50-50 basis which we believe will help us eliminate Mother-to-Child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NACA. Dr Gambo Aliyu, thanked the President for his commitment and support for the HIV response in the country, noting that as a direct result of his intervention, NACA now procures HIV commodities at manufacturers\u2019 rate, as a result of which more Nigerians living with HIV have been placed on treatment from domestic resources.\n\nHe said within the last 3 years, the agency has identified and placed on treatment an additional 900,000 persons living with HIV, bringing the total number of Nigerians on HIV treatment to 1.7 million.\n\n\u201dThis unprecedented feat puts Nigeria on a fast-track lane to control HIV spread by 2023.\n\n\u201dHowever, despite these achievements, our national coverage of prevention of mother to child transmission is less than 50%, leading to about 22,000 cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV every year in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nJustifying the need for the Fund, the Director-General said providing life-long treatment to all PLHIV even after successfully stopping new HIV infections would require a domestically sustainable financing mechanism",

We have similar and parallel positions in government. I have even held more sensitive positions than him,\u201d he said, jocularly, emphasizing that he is \u201clooking forward to having\u201d the governor as a worthy successor, who is eminently qualified to run for the highest office in the land should he chose to do so.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was ready to support Governor Tambuwal if he opts to seek PDP\u2019s ticket to be its flag bearer, provided he will be a \u201cpan Nigerian that will be just.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can reach out to all Nigerians across the geographic and other divides in our bid to support him.\n\n\u201cThis does not suggest that we are beggars hungry for power. Instead, we are worthy stakeholders with friends in many parts of the country who we can persuade to see reason with us in the realization of the Nigerian Project,\u201d Lamido stated.\n\nIn his remarks, former governor of Sokoto state, Alhaji Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, who expressed gratitude to Lamido for the warm reception accorded them, said the visit was not political but consultative.\n\n\u201cYou are not just a former governor but a great political mobilizer who people still respect and follow despite the fact that you have been out of office for almost seven years now,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal was accompanied during the visit by the deputy governor of Zamfara state, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, former deputy governor of Sokoto state, Alhaji Mukhtar Shagari, former minister for power, Engr.

Aminu Musa Koko.\n\nThe August visitors, led by Mustapha Sule Lamido, son of their host, were welcomed at Dutse International Airport by a large and joyous crowd that rode and drove with the governor\u2019s motorcade at snail speed for about two hours in a journey that is less than 30 to Bamaina, Lamido\u2019s town.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "El-Rufai cries out to Buhari: Give us North West Theatre Command to tackle terrorists",
          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to create a theatre command in the North West region to tackle banditry, noting that nine people were kidnapped daily in Kaduna state on the average.\n\nFollowing the pronouncement of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja declaring bandits, kidnappers and gunmen as terrorists, the federal government gazetted the order.\n\nWith this, security agents would now deal with this set of criminals as terrorists.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s worry\n\nSpeaking while receiving the 2021 Kaduna state Annual Security Report and the Fourth Quarter 2021 Security Report presented by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, Governor el-Rufai said there was need for a theatre command to tackle the rising wave of terrorism in the North-west region of Kaduna, Kebbi, Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Zamfara and Jigawa states.\n\nThe governor reiterated his administration\u2019s position that there is nothing like repentant bandits.\n\nTo him, anybody who can take up arms to threaten the lives and property of Nigerians has sinned against the country and does not deserve to live or benefit from any concession whatsoever from the country.\n\nLamenting the increase in the number of deaths, those kidnapped and those injured by bandits in 2021 in relation to 2020, the governor also expressed dismay over the escalation of ethno-religious strife in Zangon Kataf chiefdom and spilling into Chawai in Kauru local government.\n\nHe, however, lauded the Emirs and chiefs in the state for \u201cbeing the leading and influential anchors of peaceful coexistence in our various communities.\n\n\u201cThe report presented today shows that in 2021, an average of 9 persons were kidnapped daily across Kaduna state, mostly in the Kaduna Central senatorial district. There is also an escalation in the number of persons killed by a whopping 255 compared to those sadly killed by banditry and criminality in 2020 in spite of our best efforts in supporting the federal security agencies to bring an end to this phenomenon.\n\n\u201cKaduna state government appeals to the Federal Government to create a Theatre Command similar to the situation in the North-East to confront the insurgency that has clearly emerged in five states of the North-West and Niger state with continuous and contiguous forest ranges.\n\n\u201cThe creation of such a Theatre Command will enable holistic approach to counter-insurgent operations across the six affected states and the enhanced coordination of the resources of the Armed Forces, the Police, the SSS, our respective State Vigilance Services, hunters and other local volunteers to fight the insurgents.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that there is any phenomenon like \u2018repentant bandits\u2019. Any person that makes a conscious decision to secure arms, challenge the authority of the Nigerian state, and threatens the lives and property of Nigerians does not deserve to live, or be granted any concession by the society. There are no immediate or remote causes to justify terrorist conduct.\n\n\u201cThose that hide behind these are either ethnic jingoists, religious apologists or fail to recognise that no legitimate government can survive by tolerating terrorists or negotiating with those that menace law-abiding citizens. While acknowledging their efforts and sacrifices l, we urge our military, police and other security agencies to ensure coordinated actions and intensify simultaneous kinetic operations against these terrorists until they are decimated to the point of surrender.\n\n\u201cWe are in no doubt that there must be an urgent national effort to strengthen our security forces. The military and police need modern technology, advanced armaments, equipment and more boots on the ground. The security of our communities depends on the robust projection of state power, and that can only be done with sufficient security personnel to overawe and deter criminals. The prerogatives of the state need to be asserted, not merely proclaimed.\n\n\u201cThe people we put in uniform must never be placed in avoidable danger, outgunned or outnumbered by non-state actors. While the security agencies keep trying their best, the peacemakers on the ground should not be discouraged. Peace is worth every effort, despite the setbacks encountered.\n\n\u201cWe note with sadness the escalation of violence in Zangon Kataf Chiefdom, which appears to be rapidly spilling into the Chawai part of Kauru Local Government. We condemn the disregard for human life and the violations of law that are fuelling the crisis. We sympathise with the affected communities. This outbreak of violence is a serious challenge to the community level peace process initiated by His Highness, the Agwam of Zangon Kataf and community leaders in the area.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the security agencies, particularly the Army, Air Force, Navy, Police, Civil Defence, SSS, our State Vigilance Service and KASTLEA for constant collaboration with our Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs in the hard work of securing the state.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the reports\n\nPresenting the report to the governor, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the state lost 1,192 residents to bandits\u2019 attacks across the state in 2021, 3,348 citizens were kidnapped, while 891 sustained various forms of injury during the attacks under the period.\n\nThe report further said 13,788 cows were rustled across the state within the 12 months covered by the report.\n\nAruwan said: \u201cThere is growing threat of food insecurity in the state as farmers found it difficult to access their farms for key farming activities, having been kidnapped or for fear of being abducted.\n\n\u201cMany farmers were also killed, just as bandits extort taxes from farmers before they could access their farms. Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia, Kagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga local governments were most affected.\u201d\n\nThe Report further said the state recorded 182 cases of farm destruction either by cattle under the watch of itinerant herders or herds rustled by bandits which destroyed farms during escape, especially in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Chikun, Kajuru, Jema\u2019a, Kaura, Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas.\n\nIt further said 50 children were among those killed, as 1,038 were men and 104 women, with Kaduna Central senatorial zone recording the highest number of death of 720, followed by 406 in Kaduna South and 66 in Kaduna North.\n\nThere were 340 children kidnapped, while 2,023 of the figure were men and 985 were women. Kaduna Central zone also led in the area of kidnapping with 2,771 abducted from the zone, while 397 citizens were kidnapped from the Southern senatorial zone and 180 from the Kaduna North zone.\n\nAbout 544 residents of Kaduna Central zone sustained injury within 2021, while Kaduna South zone recorded 253 and Kaduna North zone recorded 94.\n\nThe Report further stated that \u201c10,261 cows were stolen in Kaduna Central zone, 1,941 and 1,586 cows were rustled in the Southern and Northern senatorial zones respectively.\n\n\u201cThere were increase in the various figures as the death rate of 937 recorded in 2020 paled to that of 1,192 recorded last year, also 1972 people were kidnapped on 2020 while 3,348 were kidnapped last year. The 7,935 cows stolen in 2020 almost doubled to 13,788 cows rustled in 2021.\u201d\n\nAruwan lamented the growing interaction between the bandits in the state and terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, ISWAP, and Ansaru, a development he said, had become a source of concern to the state.\n\n11 security operatives slain in Niger\n\nIn a related development, the Niger state government Tuesday confirmed bandits killed 11 security agents and several villagers in separate attacks between Friday and Saturday in Shiroro and Paikoro local government areas of the state.\n\nBut residents of the areas said at least 32 persons were killed overall across the affected communities.\n\nSpeaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Noel-Berje, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said: \u201cThe terrorists, numbering over 100 invaded the community in broad daylight, killing about 11 Joint Security Taskforce members, several villagers and leaving many injured.\u201d\n\nHe said scores of the gunmen were also said to have been neutralised.\n\nBello said the attacks on Galadiman Kogo and other villages in Shiroro council area could have been averted if the locals had alerted the security forces on time.\n\nResidents said the attacks occurred Saturday and Monday with 20 people immediately confirmed killed in Shiroro and another person in Paikoro.\n\nAdded to the official figure of security casualties, the number of the dead is now 32.\n\nChairperson Shiroro local government area, Suleiman Chukuba, had earlier confirmed the incident to Premium Times but said he could not confirm the number of casualties.\n\nBut the chairperson, Concerned Shiroro Youth Groups, Yusuf Kokki, in a statement Monday had also said 20 residents were killed and that many residents were yet to be accounted for.\n\nHe said several communities in the area had been deserted.\n\nKokki blamed the attack on the withdrawal of security personnel from their Galadima Kogo base in Shiroro for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThis decision taken by Government, notwithstanding the accompanying reason (s), is reckless and insensitive in its entirety, especially to the plights of innocent and unarmed law-abiding citizens already ravaged by incessant insecurity.\n\n\u201cConsidering how porous, prone to insecurity and vulnerable to deadly attacks by the rampaging hydra-headed, venomous murderous and heartless terrorists, Galadima Kogo is, one can easily conclude that withdrawal of security personnel at this material time is a deliberate attempt to further jeopardize people\u2019s lives and put them in the line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn view of the calamity at hand, the Concerned Shiroro Youths Of Niger State hereby call with the loudest voice on the authorities concerned to restore the withdrawn security personnel and also deploy additional security personnel to other areas prone to insecurity with immediate effect or risk our reactions,\u201d Kokki stated.\n\nBut the governor on Tuesday said the withdrawal of the soldiers \u201cwas tactical, in order to restrategise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Looting, abducting and killing\u2019\n\nResidents said the gunmen also raided Paikoro, a neighbouring council area, killing one person Monday afternoon.\n\nA resident, Salisu Sabo, told this newspaper that the gunmen, on Monday morning, were moving from one community to another, looting shops, shooting, and abducting people.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have so far invaded Ammale, Dakalo, Kuchiri, Kurmin Giwa, Goto Reshidat, Yanki and Goto Sarki communities. One person has been killed, while the injured victims are receiving treatment in Kafin Koro General Hospital.\u201d\n\n\u2018Attack could have been averted\u2019\n\nIn the official statement, Governor Bello said the attack on Galadiman Kogo would have been unsuccessful if villagers from Galape and Kudodo in Allawa had alerted the security agencies when they noticed the movements of the terrorists towards the town.\n\nHe urged villagers in the affected communities to endeavour to provide credible information to the Joint Security Taskforce stationed in the area, adding that \u201csecurity agencies cannot perform effectively and efficiently without getting appropriate support and intelligence from the people.\u201d\n\nThe governor called for calm and urged the fleeing communities in Galadiman Kogo and Kuchi in Shiroro and Munya local government areas to await a swift and immediate response from the Joint Security Taskforce, stressing that their earlier withdrawal was tactical in order to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cThe state government has already secured the order and clearance of President Buhari to carry out intensive military operations in the affected axis, assuring that ground and airstrikes would continue to comb the areas, so as to flush out those miscreants.\n\n\u201cWe have really run out of patience with the terrorists and we\u2019ll use every means possible to bring an end to these incessant bloody attacks on innocent people. We\u2019ll do everything to stop the killings and return normalcy to the affected communities.\n\n\u201cThe governor prayed for the reposed souls of the Joint Security Taskforce members and villagers who lost their lives during the attack on Galadiman Kogo and directed the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) to urgently provide succour to the injured and displaced,\u201d the statement said.",

That is why this meeting is crucial. Securing the environment is the foundation for a peaceful, well-organised and credible election.\n\n\u201cThis was clearly demonstrated in the peaceful conduct of the recent Anambra state governorship election. Let us make the FCT Area Council election another shining example of a peaceful election.\u201d\n\nEkiti polls\n\nOn the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti state, the INEC chairman said the Boot Party (BP) would not participate in the election for failure to hold primaries to nominate a candidate.\n\nHe noted that the period earmarked in the timetable and schedule of activities for party primaries ended three days ago on 29th January 2022.\n\nThe INEC boss warned the existing 18 political parties to strictly adhere to the commission\u2019s timelines for all activities, including the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates, adding that \u201cthese timelines are firm and fixed and no deviation or violation would be allowed.\u201d\n\nHe also stated for the Ekiti election, \u201call 18 political parties served notices for their party primaries to elect their candidates for the election and invited the commission to monitor them.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, one party adopted direct primary to nominate its candidate while 16 others opted for indirect primaries.\n\nHe said the commission\u2019s report on parties\u2019 primaries did not show any indication of the BP party holding a primary election.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the Ekiti state governorship election, the period earmarked in the timetable and schedule of activities for party primaries ended three days ago on 29th January 2022.\n\n\u201cAll 18 political parties served notices for their party primaries to elect their candidates for the election and invited the commission to monitor them.\n\n\u201cOne party adopted the direct method for electing its candidate while 16 parties opted for the indirect method.\n\n\u201cHowever, from on our field report, the Boot Party (BP) did not hold its primary election at any venue known to, and monitored by, the Commission.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we do not expect the party to nominate a candidate for the Ekiti state governorship election. On this note, let me once again warn political parties to strictly adhere to the commission\u2019s timelines for all activities, including the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates. These timelines are firm and fixed. No deviation or violation will be allowed,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nNSA\n\nIn his message, National Security Adviser (NSA) Major-General Babagana Mongonu (rtd) said: \u201cAs the commission puts final touches to its preparations, FCT elections are not known to have any form of violence in the past.

Over the past two years there have been military takeovers in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Guinea, as well as further east in Sudan.\n\nAs events in Guinea-Bissau unfolded, the regional political and economic block Ecowas, as well as the United States, issued condemnations.\n\nBut one thing these coups is making clear is that there\u2019s very little international bodies can issue in the way of deterrents.\n\nEcowas has issued sanctions against Mali and Burkina Faso but they haven\u2019t stopped the wave of coups in the region. Guinea-Bissau has also been subject to sanctions over the last decade.\n\nIn a recent interview, the head of Ecowas\u2019 commission said that sanctions on Guinea-Bissau had been effective because they\u2019d helped the country return to peace. That assessment now seems to have been premature.\n\nSoldiers in the region have seized upon popular discontent with corrupt and ineffective governance to justify their actions. In Burkina Faso and Mali, their actions have been welcomed with joy from some parts of the population.\n\nBut analysts worry the democratic gains made in the region over the past two years are being undermined, and that what was once known as Africa\u2019 Coup Belt could well be earning that name again.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "More than 1 million farmers in the state have been displaced because of the intercommunal violence between herders and farmers competing for water and land, say officials.\n\nHere in Benue state, harvests of rice, yams and soybeans were once so bountiful that it was called the \u201cfood basket of Nigeria.\u201d But waves of violence over the last several years have reduced crops in the northcentral state of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cSometimes we manage to eat once (a day),\u201d says Mohammed, who has three children, aged five and younger. \u201cSince the crisis, it is only by the grace of God we are feeding to remain alive.\u201d\n\nWith that decreased yield, Mohammed hasn\u2019t made enough money to buy seedlings to grow yams, soybeans and guinea corn (sorghum).\n\nHer husband Ibrahim Mohammed, 45, used to harvest as many as 10 bags of rice a year from his farm. But that dropped to just three bags after attackers burned his home to the ground a few years ago, as violence between farmers and herders escalated across the northwest and central parts of Nigeria.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 p.m. and Hannah Mgbede asks her husband if she can take her first break of the day from threshing rice so she can breastfeed their 18-month-old baby girl fastened to her back during the grueling work.\n\n\u201cWe are heading to a food crisis,\u201d Benue state Gov. Samuel Ortom told The Associated Press.\n\nAcross northern Nigeria, at least 13 million are now facing hunger amid a lean season, according to the U.N. World Food Program. The violence has also disrupted the sales of food as roads are too unsafe for farmers to transport crops and marketplaces have been razed by attackers.\n\nRice production has dropped so much that its price has jumped more than 60% in Benue state as well as some other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a very real risk of famine because both conflict and COVID-19 has made it harder to reach those most in need,\u201d a spokesperson of the U.N. agency told AP.\n\nThousands of Nigerians have been killed in the decades-long clashes between agrarian communities and nomadic cattle herders who are fighting over limited access to water and grazing land. The farmers often accuse the herders of encroaching in their fields while the herders, mostly from the Fulani ethnic group, claim the croplands are their traditional grazing routes.\n\nThe government has now launched an initiative under the National Livestock Transformation Plan in the hope of resolving the conflict which has been worsened by the proliferation of arms and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute past perpetrators from both groups.\n\nAbout 3,000 people who have fled the violence in Benue state are now living at a camp in Guma local government area.\n\nMtonga Iliamgee, 43, says every day is a struggle to feed her family of 10. She was seen preparing their only meal of the day at 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe live for the day and we don\u2019t know what tomorrow could bring,\u201d she says.\n\nFelix Agune, the deputy head of the camp school, says some children come to class crying that they\u2019ve had no breakfast. Non-government organizations are trying to fill the gap but it is \u201cnothing compared to the massive hunger spread across Benue state,\u201d said Rex Elanu, a program director for the One to One Healthcare Initiative.\n\nGovernment officials insist they are working to make farmlands safe enough for people to return and work the land. They\u2019re also trying to encourage nomadic herders to take up ranching so they are less at odds with farmers.\n\nSeeds and fertilizers have also been supplied to farmers in the past to enhance food production, cushion the effect of the pandemic and encourage more youths to go into agriculture, according to a spokesman of the agriculture ministry.\n\nDespite the violence, Nigerian farmers have been able to produce enough crops to keep the country self-sufficient in staples such as rice, cassava and yams.\n\n\u201cNigeria survived with the produce generated by the smallholder farmers,\u201d Theodore Ogaziechi of the agriculture ministry said. \u201cThe farmers are doing their utmost best to feed the nation.\u201d\n\nFarmers are resilient but also afraid because some who have attempted to go back to their farms have been killed, warned Ortom, the governor of Benue state.\n\n\u201cIf there is security for these farmers, we\u2019ll continue to retain our position as the food basket of the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if nothing is done, as it is now, it is a big challenge.\u201d",

He urged rice mills owners to be involved in paddy production for sustainable supply through partnership with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cAs we increase the milling capacity of rice nationwide, we are encouraging all rice mills to embrace our backward integration programme and get involved in paddy production to guarantee sustainable supply of paddy to your mills and complement the supply from smallholder farmers.\n\n\u201cThe private sector-led Accelerated Agriculture Development Scheme provides long-term financing options to millers to finance commercial farms, land development, irrigation facilities; and other agricultural infrastructure that will enhance the production plan.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the quality of milled Nigerian rice could match others produced in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cAs Nigerians, we need to become more patriotic and embrace Mr. President\u2019s mantra of producing what we eat, and eat what we grow,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele noted that prior to the introduction of the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme in Nigeria, there were less than 10 functional rice-milling plants in the country, with a combined capacity of 350,000 metric tons.\n\n\u201cThese have increased to over 60 integrated mills, with combined capacity of over three million metric tons, as at today, with about 10 more mills scheduled to be commissioned this year,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Kano State Governor, Mr. Abdullahi Ganduje, said the state was surrounded by dams and rivers, which gave farmers ample opportunity for growing rice, tomato, and other crops. Ganduje assured that his administration would continue to provide an enabling environment for farming and business activities in the state.\n\nGanduje revealed that the new rice mill would assist in creating jobs and boost the economic status of people in the state.\n\nThe governors of Jigawa and Kebbi states, Badaru Abubakar and Atiku Bagudu, respectively, attended the ceremony. They thanked Buhari for introducing the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme to guarantee food security.\n\nChairman, Gerawa Rice Mill, Alhaji Isa Gerawa, thanked the CBN for supporting him to establish the factory at the cost of N15 billion.

According to agency reports, possible casualties were unclear.\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent is forcing some analysts to call for the establishment of an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) military force in the form of ECOMOG, to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nA security source told journalists in Bissau that at the government\u2019s palace, an unknown number of people were hit by gunfire with two persons killed. But it was unclear who the casualties were.\n\nIt was also learnt that Sissoco Embalo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the building with a heavy security detail.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the normally busy streets around the palace were deserted in the afternoon, with an unverified video shared on social media appeared to show a man standing outside the compound firing a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nThe government has however been silent about the incident as no official statement has been made.\n\nThe West Africa region has been mired by military take-over in the last 18 months with military take over in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is not new to coup d\u2019etat as for decades, there has been history of nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974. This has severely affected her economy which relies heavily on the export of cashew nuts.\n\nThe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which some analysts are calling for, was a West African multilateral armed force established by the sub-regional body. ECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, among others.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).
