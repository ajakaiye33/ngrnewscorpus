          "text": "The Kaduna State Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina Muhammed-Baloni, has said cholera claimed about 175 lives across the 23 Local Government Areas of the state last year.\n\nThe commissioner disclosed this while receiving cholera testing equipments donated by the World Health Organisation to the state in Kaduna on Thursday.\n\nThe items donated included sero-type reagents among others for the zonal cholera laboratory located at the late Yusuf Dantsofo Memorial Hospital, Tudun-Wada, in the state capital.\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after receiving the items, Muhammed-Baloni, said the state witnessed high cases of cholera in 2021 with a casualty figure of 175.\n\nThe commissioner said that the 23 local government areas in the state recorded the disease, adding that the WHO donation would go a long way in enhancing the containment of the disease.\n\nMuhammed-Baloni, represented by the ministry\u2019s Permanent Secretary, Adamu Mohammed-Mansir, said, \u201cAs far the issue of cholera was concerned in 2021, virtually all the local government areas had cases of cholera and the casualties were quite a number.\n\n\u201cSo this effort by the World Health Organisation, concerned about the health matters around the world, came at the right time because this will enhance our capability to not only do the rapid diagnostic test but also to know the type of cholera in the state. We thank WHO for the support to Kaduna State. We recorded some deaths from the cholera epidemics. One hundred and seventy five people died from the disease in the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the acting state Coordinator of WHO, Dr Dauda Madubu, said that the donated items became imperative because the world health body was concerned about the outbreak of the disease in the state in particular and the country in general.\n\nMadubu noted that after the COVID-19 pandemic, cholera posed a greater challenge to not only the state, but the entire country hence the need to urgently tackle the disease.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to hand over some items that are donated by the WHO to support the containment of the outbreaks of cholera in the state. The country is facing a lot of outbreaks of the disease since 2020 when we had the outbreak of the COVID-19 and in 2021. Almost all the 23 LGAs had confirmed cases of cholera and we had challenges in terms of confirming the suspected cases.\n\n\u201cThat was why the WHO thought that we should increase the capacity of each of the LGAs so that we would be able to do rapid diagnosis testing and then to confirm the cases at the Yusuf Dantsofo Laboratory which is going be a confirmation centre.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Reps committee seeks state of emergency on schools infrastructure",
          "text": "*Says COVID-19 awareness campaign in schools without water, sanitizers is exercise in futility\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013 THE House of Representatives Committee on Basic Education, has called for declaration of state of emergency on schools\u2019 infrastructure in the country, saying the condition where children were being subjected to learn under was unacceptable.\n\nThe committee also called for digitalisation of all basic schools in the country, tasking authorities to fashion out policies that would ensure all headmasters and teachers were computer literate.\n\nREAD ALSO:Sterling Bank set to reward young tech founders in HEART sectors\n\nThis came as stakeholders in education sector claimed authorities at different levels have not lived up to expectations in repositioning basic education.\n\nChairman of the committee,Prof. JuliusIhonvbere, speaking in Abuja, at an education summit organised the Human Development Initiative,HDI,insisted that children were learning under deplorable infrastructure,a situation he noted,was contributing greatly to their poor performance.\n\nHon. Ihonvbere at the occasion with the theme:\u201dBuilding Qualitative, Inclusive and Adaptive Education System: Meeting Modern Day Education Challenges in Nigeria\u201d, also frowned at the lackadaisical attitudes of state governora in accessing their counterpart funds with the Universal Basic Education Commission,UBEC just as he accused others of diverting the funds to other areas outside education.\n\nAccording to him,\u201dThe absence of policy consistency, poor funding and inadequate basic facilities are major challenges in the sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want a kind of emergency declared on school infrastructure.The children are learning under very dangerous buildings leaking. Some of them unsteady. Well,we pray non crashes on the children,\u201dhe said.\n\nFor basic education to regain its place in the country,he said,\u201dThere should be a special programme that would bring the teachers and instructors into the digital age\u201d, because according to him,\u201d You cannot give what you do not have. You cannot teach what you do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is never too late. Nobody is too old to learn how to use a simple computer. I believe if we take that as a starting point, things will change. There is no reason why we can\u2019t digitalise our schools, provide electricity through solar and provide water,\u201dhe added.\n\nGoing further he said:\u201d How do you take a six- year old,seven years old and put them in a classroom a whole day without water to wash their hands and yet we are saying COVID-19 is here,wash your and sanitise your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWater is basic, it\u2019s not there even to drink. Again, where\u2019s the sanitizer? So there are many things that are wrong but I believe that government policies can resolve these,then sanctioning those who violate those rules because,\u201dhe said.\n\nHe frowned that some state governments had abandoned their counterpart funds with the Universal Basic Education Commission while some diverted the money to other areas outside education.\n\n\u201cUBEC gives money and some of these funds are not properly managed and nothing happens. So those coming after will repeat the same mistake.How can a governor stay in office for eight years and not access his state\u2019s money with UBEC? And some who access do not deploy the money to the right place! That is why people are saying state governments have roles to play, after all,they budget money for education but they don\u2019t release it to education. It is not all the state,some states are doing very well. In some states,you don\u2019t even know what they do with the funds,\u201dhe said.\n\nAlso speaking at the occasion, a former Provost of Osun State College of Education, Prof Labayo Kazeem, said the nation\u2019s education sector was not lacking in policy but implementation.\n\nKazeem,who said governors were not willing to provide infrastructure, regretted that adult education was completely dead in most states.\n\n\u201cThey are more concerned about other things that are happening apart from investing in education. We don\u2019t need development partners to tell us what to do right.We are not lacking in policy. They are so comprehensive. We have joined every convention. Education is the only thing that can drive development.\n\n\u201cIf we must develop as a nation, the students must be given the opportunity to excel. That is why when we go anywhere in the world we can adapt. Help us tell the governor\u2019s to be serious with our education.\u201d\n\nOn her part,the Executive Director of Human Development Initiatives, Olufunsho Owasanoye, called for a review in curriculum while stressing the need for teachers to adapt to technological advancements.\n\n\u201cSome states have nothing to write home about, insecurity, low mortality for students and teachers, overpopulation and so on. We are in the techy era but some teachers especially the old ones are not really in tune with it. Everybody has to be technology compliant. We need to rebuild education and adapt to the new technology.\n\n\u201cEducation in any state must take priority. There must be a round-table to discuss what has not been done. The people had to come together and the government needs to strengthen the existing structure and put more structure to ensure the students are safe. When the students know that they are safe they would be willing to go to school\u201d,she said.",

          "text": "Ezra Ukanwa\n\nIn the wake of increasing attacks by arsonists in some parts of the country, the Federal Capital Territory Fire Service, has challenged state governors to expend funds in equipping states\u2019 fire stations with hi-techs.\n\nThe Fire service boss, Opetunsin Julius while stating this during a community fire safety awareness and donation of fire safety equipment to a Model Junior Secondary School, in Abuja, asserted that it will aid the service\u2019s effectiveness at the state level.\n\nThe community fire safety awareness and donation of fire safety equipment program was organized by the Rotary Club Asokoro, Abuja Diamond in collaboration with the FCT Fire Service and sponsored by Mirror of the masses initiative.\n\nSpeaking during an interview, the fire service boss, represented by the FCT Public Relations Officer, Ibrahim Tauheed said that it is imperative for the service to engage secondary school students about the right response to fire incidents around them.\n\nAddressing issues of fire menace reported in Nigeria in the past couple of months, Ibrahim said that the reason most fire incidents had happened unabated in some of the states is due to the poor fire service force in some states and the absolute equipment used for fire control in those state.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome states are not doing well in equipping or motivating the fire service but that is not to be said of FCT as it is so proactive that we set up our fire stations in almost every nook and cranny of FCT, especially from Abagji up to Bwari from Bwari up to Karu, and we have about 16 fire stations, the more are still springing up.\n\n\u201cHowever, that of the states is political will because if you care less about safety, then you are ready to bear the cost. And that is why when it happens, it becomes so devastation.\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with governors so that they will have the political will to make the fire service adjusted in their various states functional so that they be more productive and the only way to go by it is to give them more equipment and give them training so that they will employ more personnel so that they will be able to cover the entire state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling all the state governors to do same because they should copy from what the Minister of FCT is doing in the FCT. We are trying and we are springing up more stations soon which I believe you the media will be abreast of the situation.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the need to sensitize secondary school child at their level, the PRO bemoaned the level of ignorance displayed by most parents in tackling fire incidents at home, said the students when sensitized would do the needful at home.\n\n\u201cI actually want the students to take this knowledge back home so that they will be our Vanguard anywhere they are. We have seen students coming out of their cars and helping out another car that is on fire. We want students to go back and tell the parents the right things to do.\n\n\u201cthose are the type of students we want to see in our society, those who have the courage to really fight fire to prevent fire from happening, both at home and in their schools.\n\nThe Service\u2019s PRO who said the service is currently carrying-out a \u201cdry season campaign\u201d assured the management of the school that it would establish a fire safety club in the school environs so as to help the students on the manner to go during a fire breakout.\n\nAccording to him, in the course of the lecture I told them that we would be back to integrate fire safety club in this school.\n\n\u201cThough we\u2019ve done that in so many schools here in FCT but we\u2019re still yet to cover so many. So we actually told them that we are going to come back and introduce more to them using the medium of fire safety club.\n\n\u201cYes, we are in a season now that that is kind of fire outbreak is much happening in the season like these are harmattan season so we are actually embarking on dry season campaign.\n\n\u201cImmediately after dry season campaign we are certain to go back to our fire safety in schools and some other organizations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually doing that in pari pass with the dry season campaign. We are giving more emphasis on dry season campaign than other season because we just want people to be of good behavior on how they are burning their farms, how they are being careless at home. So, that\u2019s why we said we would take the dry season campaign seriously\u201d, he added.\n\nThe president of the Rotary Club Asokoro diamond, Abuja, said that the sensitization program was organized to help inform the growing wards on the proper thing to do where ever they find themselves.\n\nHe stated: \u201cwe organized this program to tell the children and young ones that fire safety is the key and how to manage fire outbreaks.\n\n\u201cAfter this exercise we will still go to other school because we are in partnership with fire service. We won\u2019t be stopping here. We are still going to do more in spreading it across Abuja and we will be doing online sensitization, too.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on what he learnt during the awareness creation program, one of the prize winners, Emeka Iheanacho, said that the he had known what he never knew before and that the knowledge gained was useful, stating that he would take it back home to educate his parents on fire safety.\n\n\u201cSome of the things discussed today were news to me. I did not know them before, especially knowing that there is something they call fire blanket.\n\n\u201d the ideas are good and I would take them back home to tell my parents. My mother has to know about the risk she is leaving the gas cylinder inside the house that is supposed to be outside.\n\n\u201d I want to thank the agencies that came around to educate us on what we have known today\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking on the need for parents to hearken to their wards, the Vice Principal, Agwuna Nneka, said that the Rotary Club in Abuja in collaboration with the Fire Service had done an immense job in creating fire safety awareness to the students, also stating that the students should be heard when they take their knowledge back home.",

          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, yesterday described the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress, APC, administration as a government of liars by liars and for liars.\n\nThis is as the party said its position is predicated on the desperate attempt by the Buhari administration \u201cto whitewash itself by sending Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, whose stock-in-trade is well known, to again assault the sensibilities of Nigerians with litany of fake claims on anti-corruption and anti-terrorism fight when in reality the Buhari administration is sinking deeper into the abyss of failure on these planks.\u201d\n\nIn a statement late Thursday night and signed by its spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, the main opposition party said \u201cThe APC administration is unsettled by the Transparency International, TI, report which ranks Nigeria under President Buhari as the second most corrupt country in West Africa and 154 out of 180 in Global Corruption Index, given APC\u2019s humongous corruption including the exposed looting of over N16 trillion public funds by APC leaders and their cronies in government. \u201c\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIn its ludicrous anti-corruption scorecard, the APC government has no response to the reported looting of $25 billion under its watch as detailed in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, leaked memo under its watch.\n\n\u201cThe APC government should give answers to the reported stealing of N165 billion in the Nigeria Ports Authority, NPA, the N1.5 trillion and $9.5 million reportedly stolen from Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, the $65 million frittered from the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, FMBN, as well as the N90 billion reportedly looted from the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the reported looting of N33 billion from the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, the reported stealing of over N18 billion from the rehabilitation of IDPs in the North East, the over N25 billion from the National Health Insurance Scheme, NHIS, as well as the looting of N500 billon Social Investment Programme Fund as revealed by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari among others.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the very pathetic attempt to conceal the apparent complicity of the APC in the advent and continuing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture laboured strenuously and claimed that the APC government has uncovered 96 sponsors of terrorism and arrested 45 persons confirmed to be terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is laughable because Nigerians know that the APC administration habours within its rank a self-confessed terrorism apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, who superintend over the very critical Ministry of Communication and its agencies which are very vital in any meaningful fight against terrorism\n\n\u201cNigerians ask, if the APC cannot purge itself of a self-confessed terrorism apologist, how can it claim to have effectively confronted terrorism in the country? The PDP restates its demand to the APC to publish the names and details of those it claims to be sponsors of terrorism and those it claims to have been arrested.\n\n\u201cNigerians have decoded the lying propensity of the APC and can no longer be hoodwinked. Like everything in life, the lies and propaganda of the APC at every election cycle has expiry date and as such the APC should expect the inevitable crushing verdict of the people in the 2023 elections.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Approves N115bn to dualise Katsina road\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved contracts worth $328.87 million in consultancy services for the supervision of the various railway projects in the country. FEC also approved N115.4 billion for the dualisation of Kano-Kazaure-Kongolam highway in Katsina State.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday in Abuja by Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, after the weekly virtual FEC meeting, which was presided by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House.\n\nGiving a breakdown of his ministry\u2019s presentations at the meeting, Amaechi said he presented two memoranda, one of which was in respect of the consultancy services, adding that the second one was for the concessioning of the Onitsha River Port.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cMinistry of Transportation presented two memos and the first one has to do with the contract for consultancy services for the supervision of the various railway projects. Remember that we have about three railway projects that are yet to start construction and they include the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri, Kano-Maradi and then the Abuja-Warri.\n\n\u201cFor the consultancy services, the following contractors were approved, with the total cost of $183.7 million: GIX Engineers Infrastructure Excellence/Yaroso & Partnership Ltd, Core Consulting Engineering Plc. That\u2019s for Abuja to Warri.\n\n\u201cFor the consultancy services for supervision of Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railway, with branch lines to Bonny Deep Seaport and Port Harcourt Industrial Park, and, then, to Owerri, we have Kyari Consults SDMBHD/Jamood Global Services Limited at $97.5 million. The first one is $38.4 million.\n\n\u201cThe last one is consultancy services for the supervision of Kano-Katsina-Jibia-Maradi Rail-line to TEAM (Technics Engineering Architecture Marketing Nigeria Limited) and that is for $47,670,000 million. All of them are for a period of 36 months. That\u2019s the first.\n\n\u201cThe second one is that the cabinet approved a concession agreement for the Ministry of Transportation to concession the Onitsha River Port to a company, called Inversal Elysium Consortium. They are to manage the river port for 30 years.\u201d\n\nOn why the federal government was abandoning the agreements signed with China on construction of railway in the country, Amaechi explained, \u201cActually, that is why there is a delay. We were waiting on the Chinese to give us the loans we applied for and till today they\u2019ve not replied. They kept delaying us \u2013 will the delay extend our tenure? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone to Standard Chartered Bank and while they\u2019ve done financial closure, they\u2019ve approved some level of funding. We are also pursuing Port Harcourt-Maiduguri line with Standard Chartered Bank. The Lagos-Kano, part of it will come from Standard Chartered Bank, and part of it will come from some commercial banks in China.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, said the council approved a contract for the dualisation of the Kano-Kazaure-Kongolam Road at the cost of N115.4 billion. Fashola explained that the project, which covers 131.4 kilometres, was expected to be completed within a period of 48 months.\n\nFashola said, \u201cMinistry of Works and Housing presented one memo for the dualisation of the Kano-Kazaure-Kongoland highway, 131.4 kilometres, from a single carriage way to dual carriage way. So, council approved that proposal at a cost of N115,425, 896,907.15 kobo (in billion) over 48months.\n\n\u201cThe instructive thing is that the financing will be done by the Tax Credit Scheme of Bua International Limited. And they will use Messrs PW Construction Nigeria limited, a company in which they have acquired some interest, to undertake the construction.\u201d\n\nBriefing newsmen also, Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said FEC approved an Energy Transition Plan for the country.\n\n\u201cThis memo was presented as a plan for Nigeria to achieve net zero carbon emission,\u201d the minister said, noting, \u201cthis will clearly set out the pathway for Nigeria in achieving this.\u201d\n\nIkeazor further said FEC also approved a second memo to aid the Waste Battery Management Policy for Nigeria.\n\nThis policy, according to her, \u201cWill create a lot of jobs in the circular economy for Nigeria and at the same time protect the health of Nigerians to make sure that hazardous waste, like waste batteries, are properly disposed of with regulations, including recycling in Nigeria as well.\u201d\n\nShe said her ministry also presented to the council a report on the last COP 26 (the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference), which Nigeria attended, and the country\u2019s plans for COP 27 going forward.\n\nOn his part, Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora, said council, during a closed-door session, also approved the award of contract for consultancy services to facilitate the building of the corporate headquarters of National Health Insurance Scheme in Abuja.\n\nMamora said, \u201cThe need has become inevitable to expand what is on ground to improve the operational efficiency of that agency, which is the National Health Insurance Scheme and happily, the council considered the memo approved same.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insists no zone will be denied opportunity to contest\n\n\u2022Northern group reechoes party\u2019s position\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nUnmoved by loud agitation for a presidential candidate from the southern part of Nigeria, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said unequivocally that its presidential ticket was open to all the six geopolitical zones of the country. The party stated this position when it received a letter from a group, Northern Advocate for Good Governance (NAFGG), which advocated a presidential candidate of northern Nigeria origin in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIt was the first time the main opposition party would be stating its position on the presidency clearly ahead of the next general election.\n\nPDP maintained that no zone would be denied the opportunity of contesting in the election.\n\nNAFGG echoed PDP\u2019s position, saying all the geopolitical zones, including those that had produced the president before, should be eligible to vie for the presidential ticket.\n\nReceiving the report from the group on behalf of the national chairman, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Abdullahi Ibrahim, commended NAFGG for taking the initiative to support equal opportunity for all the geopolitical zones.\n\nIbrahim stated, \u201cThis is a commendable initiative. We are doing the best we can in that regard, if Nigerians like you find it pertinent to assist us in achieving that objective.\n\n\u201cThe new National Working Committee (NWC) under the leadership of Senator Iyorchia Ayu has already resolved this is exactly what it would pursue as an objective in ensuring that the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria were given equal opportunity to bid for the available offices to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIbrahim further expatiated the party\u2019s position while speaking with THISDAY. He said, \u201cFor the opportunities that are available, you heard the convener talking about providing equal opportunity for Nigerians to bid for the available political offices. Those who are interested in pursuing the presidency, we are opening it for every Nigerian to pursue and many other offices that are national in outlook, Nigerians are free to pursue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he meant that the presidency should be thrown open, he responded, \u201cOf course!\u201d, adding, \u201cYes, that is what it implies. As we speak, every Nigerian is bidding from the South-east, from the South-west, and from the North. No section of Nigeria will be denied an opportunity to contest or aspire. It is left for Nigerians to decide where they want to allow the presidency go.\u201d\n\nIbrahim insisted the opposition party believed in equity and fairness.\n\nAsked if PDP might zone its presidential ticket to the South-east, in deference to former vice presidential candidate and ex-governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi\u2019s demand, Ibrahim stated, \u201cWhat Peter Obi said was, if it favours the South-east and as one Nigeria, who comes from that zone, he will contest. But it\u2019s a question of allowing everyone to bid; it\u2019s a platform that is opened to all Nigerians on equal and justifiable process. If you think you are suitable, come and throw your cap in the ring and the remaining will be story.\n\n\u201cWe will not condone twisted and half-baked conclusions. From 1999 to 2023, the south would have ruled Nigeria for 14 years, while the north for 10 years. Why should we then prioritise the south to take over when the north has a shortfall?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Ibrahim has deliberately left out the fact that, of Nigeria\u2019s 62 years since independence, the north has ruled cumulatively for 41 years and six months, while the south has only been in power for 20 years and six months, thus making his argument disingenuous.\n\nThe list below on power sharing since 1960 suffices:\n\nAbubakar Tafawa Balewa: 1960-1966; Azikwe Nnamdi: October 1, 1963-January 16, 1966; Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi: January 16, 1966-July 29, 1966; Yakubu Gowon: August 1, 1966-July 29, 1975; Murtala Mohammed: July 29, 1975-February 13, 1976; Olusegun Obasanjo: February 13, 1976-October 1, 1979; Shehu Shagari: October 1, 1979-December 31, 1983 and Muhammadu Buhari: December 31, 1983-August 27, 1985.\n\nAlso, Ibrahim Babangida: August 27, 1985-August 26, 1993; Earnest Shonekan: August 26, 1993-November 17, 1993; Sani Abacha: November 17, 1993-June 8, 1998; Abdusalami Abubakar: June 8, 1998-May 29, 1999; Olusegun Obasanjo: May 29, 1999-May 29, 2007; Umar Yar\u2019Adua: May 29, 2007-May 5, 2010; Goodluck Jonathan: May 29, 2010-May 29, 2015; and Muhammadu Buhari: May 29, 2015 till date.\n\nHowever, in the letter to National Chairman of PDP, National Coordinator of the northern group, Mallam Mahmoud Mohammed Katun, called for priority to be given to zones in the north that had not had the opportunity to govern Nigeria to guarantee equity, fairness, and justice.\n\nHowever Katun said, \u201cBut, even more importantly, it is our considered position that political parties should prioritise experience, competence, and capacity in choosing or zoning their presidential tickets.\n\n\u201cBoth the North-east and North-central parts of the country have very distinguished and eminently qualified people to run for the president of Nigeria in their various political affiliations. In fact, we dare any group to suggest a candidate that can rival the likes of Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Abubakar Saraki, and Bala Mohammed, all eminent and qualified aspirants from the aforementioned zones.\n\n\u201cWe are of the view that if the principle of zoning is to be observed to the latter, both the North-east and North-central should be considered, as they represent two out of three zones that have not produced the president of Nigeria as things stand.\n\n\u201cWe further call on political actors in Nigeria across party divides to look deeply and come up with a more holistic approach to zoning, in order to produce the best hands, who can rescue Nigeria from its current abyss.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state unequivocally that as a group, the Northern Advocates for Good Governance seeks equity, fairness and justice in zoning the presidency of Nigeria in 2023, so that this can bring about good governance to Nigerians at all levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Elumelu raises concerns over $4bn oil theft, insists its national disgrace\n\nJames Emejo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, yesterday expressed doubts over Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures, describing them as crazy and opaque.\n\nThe minister who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned broadcast station, in apparent frustration, noted that there\u2019s nothing that needed to be interrogated that had not been questioned on the subsidy matter.\n\nAlso, the Founder/Chairman of Heirs Holdings Limited, Mr. Tony Elumelu, yesterday said incessant oil theft in the Niger Delta region remained a major national challenge requiring urgent attention by the country\u2019s leadership. Elumelu, while delivering the National Defence College, Course 30 Lecture titled: \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d further described the activities of oil thieves as a national disgrace which requires national seminar and dialogue to address.\n\nSylva agreed that figures released by concerned authorities were questionable, stressing that the best solution to the issue would have been to completely remove the subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s subsidy regime has for decades remained a subject of controversy, with the figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres.\n\nAs at today, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) is the sole importer of the product, since private businessmen exited the scene due to non-availability of foreign exchange years ago.\n\nHaving backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy as dictated by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the executive arm of government is set to approach the National Assembly to approve the N3 trillion for the payment of subsidies in 2022. The government last week extended the implementation by 18 months.\n\nThe minister alleged that a few persons were holding the rest of the country to ransom, explaining that the rich rather than the most vulnerable in the country gain more from the payment of subsidies than the poor.\n\nSpeaking on the dynamics of rising consumption figures and increasing subsidy payment, Sylva explained that although there was something fishy about the data, there\u2019s nothing that hadn\u2019t been done in the past to muscle those bleeding the country without success.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling some of the smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or to the 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque . The opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we get just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all.\n\n\u201cI know when people say the figures are\u2026 I mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no, no, no. There\u2019s been trial of subsidy thieves. Oh, we\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the template, these are the components of the templates,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister was reacting to the insistence by a co-guest, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, an energy law expert and President Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), that Nigeria must investigate how many litres it consumes, among others.\n\nThe minister maintained that even labour which is against the removal of the subsidy knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to hemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues. We can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing as you agree with me, to continue to be hemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budgeted. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to be benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidised environment, reason the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the Export Free Zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port, because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed his to sell at a profit internationally. If we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government in that case, is the cost of freight,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that that it was his own model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime,\u201d Sylva added.\n\nOn the issue of pipeline maintenance and repairs, the minister stressed that under the PIA, the refineries will be managed distinctly from the crude oil pipelines.\n\nDescribing it as a very thorny issue, he expressed the view that the PIA will be the solution to some of the current problems with managing the pipelines.\n\nHe pointed out that before now, the midstream in the industry was grossly under-developed because the fiscals were not there.\n\n\u201cIf you have a situation where somebody owns a refinery and then at the same time is expected to run a pipeline that is 600 kilometres long, then it becomes difficult for him to run.\n\n\u201cHe should focus on running a refinery if it\u2019s a refinery operator, then you must have somebody who also focuses on running the pipeline and it becomes his business.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Nigeria, we never saw the pipeline as a business. So the pipeline was always an attachment to a refinery. It was becoming very sub-optimally managed because the refinery operators could not manage the pipelines.\n\n\u201cSo what we are now doing is to decouple the pipelines from the refineries, outsource those pipelines to people who can now focus on managing the pipelines. So it will be a different ballgame after the fixing of the refineries, he assured\u201d\n\nOmorogbe had in her comments, said that the reforms in the industry were unnecessarily slow, with the PIA taking over 20 years to bring to fruition.\n\n\u201cThe downstream has been in a mess for a long time. Any downstream operator will tell you that off the record, and will tell you that it\u2019s worsening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just in pains to know how we can implement the petroleum industry act. But I think a lot of the problem is that Nigerians have never really interrogated what this subsidy is, if it\u2019s there to cushion us against the different price effects of importing petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWhat are the components of what is being paid for subsidy? When you look at landing cost, what are the components of that landing costs? How much of it is the demurrage for example?\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying for the incompetence of the system? If the government would get out of this area, I can see that many things would be wiped out, even though one is talking about temporarily having the price shoot up, it\u2019ll come down.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s competition. No private person will pay for some of the things that are happening right now. That\u2019s why I say I really don\u2019t know where to start. But we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s interrogate and say, how many litres do we use in Nigeria every day? Statistics in the downstream is incredibly opaque,\u201d she argued\n\nElumelu Raises Concerns over $4bn Oil Theft, Says Its National Disgrace\n\nAccording to Elumelu, who is also the Chairman of the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), between January and September last year, Nigeria lost over $4 billion to oil thieves\n\nwho don\u2019t pay tax but use their illicit proceeds to acquire more lethal ammunition and continued to pose threats to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nHe expressed worry that the development had put so much money in the hands of those who don\u2019t pay tax and who are not regulated, making the country unsafe.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, and thieves take 50,000 per day.\u201d\n\nHe said addressing the sordid situation required strategic as well as resilience of leadership adding that, \u201cthings can\u2019t continue that way. The country should wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to men and women of this country to help remove this national disgrace,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe theft in the Niger Delta is a national challenge. To me, it requires national seminar and dialogue. It is in my viewpoint, one of the lethal threats to our country, because it is so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate and the country is not safe.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last three quarters of last year from January to September lost over $4 billion to thieves who don\u2019t pay tax and they use it to pile more lethal ammunition and pose threats to our corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the growing youth restiveness in Nigeria and Africa to the absence of strategic leadership principles which he said among others required setting priorities, execution of goals, setting of timelines and milestones as well as clarity of purpose.\n\nHe said these leadership principles had helped shape his focus and eventual successes in the private sector, stressing that they are as well applicable to the public sector if results must be achieved.\n\nElumelu in the course of his lecture also touched on the need for leaders to match words with actions so people don\u2019t lose interest in their leadership.\n\nHe also emphasised the need to pay attention to merit and ensure that the most qualified persons are appointed to positions of authority.\n\nOn the role of private sector in fighting terror and promoting peace in the continent, the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation said he had been a proponent of African capitalism which he believes would lead to long-term investment to address endemic poverty.\n\nHe argued that people who have economic hope do not take to extremism, saying only jobless persons are susceptible to social vices.\n\nHe said governments must get serious with eradicating poverty and creating economic opportunities for the growing youth population in order to avert a greater catastrophe.\n\n\u201cUnless we get serious on our continent, it\u2019s just starting, \u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere can\u2019t be peace when people are hungry. It\u2019s an imposed peace and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it explodes.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, what African youths need is economic opportunity and not interested in handouts adding that they presently lacked such opportunity.\n\nElumelu said government must wake up and realise that the young ones would someday hold them accountable.\n\nHe said the fact that 60 per cent of the Nigeria\u2019s population lived below the poverty index had more to do about leadership.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can correct these things. We need to do more. Poverty is the reason we have problems in the world.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Analysts call for new ECOMOG to protect democracy\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja with agency report\n\nThere was apprehension in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau and across Africa yesterday over possible military take-over as sporadic gunshots were heard near a compound where the nation\u2019s President Umaro Sissoco Embalo was presiding over a cabinet meeting. According to agency reports, possible casualties were unclear.\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent is forcing some analysts to call for the establishment of an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) military force in the form of ECOMOG, to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nA security source told journalists in Bissau that at the government\u2019s palace, an unknown number of people were hit by gunfire with two persons killed. But it was unclear who the casualties were.\n\nIt was also learnt that Sissoco Embalo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the building with a heavy security detail.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the normally busy streets around the palace were deserted in the afternoon, with an unverified video shared on social media appeared to show a man standing outside the compound firing a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nThe government has however been silent about the incident as no official statement has been made.\n\nThe West Africa region has been mired by military take-over in the last 18 months with military take over in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is not new to coup d\u2019etat as for decades, there has been history of nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974. This has severely affected her economy which relies heavily on the export of cashew nuts.\n\nThe ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) which some analysts are calling for, was a West African multilateral armed force established by the sub-regional body. ECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, among others.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).

          "text": "Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, says President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to look into the criminal charges preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe commission had, on Monday, filed a 17-count charge against the former Imo governor before a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nThe charge against Okorocha came hours after he formally declared his intention to run for president.\n\nAccording to the EFCC, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the state house on Thursday, Okorocha said the charges by the commission are \u201ctrumped up to distract him\u201d, adding that a competent court has delivered a judgment restraining the EFCC from prosecuting him.\n\nOkorocha also said he visited Buhari to ask for his intervention on the anti-graft agency\u2019s planned prosecution, and to seek the immediate release of his international passport still being held by the EFCC.\n\nAccording to him, it is the responsibility of Buhari as president of Nigeria to ensure that justice is served on all citizens, including him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president said he would take up the matter, especially when he saw the judgment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said, he\u2019ll take up the matter and find out what is actually happening. And I hope he will do so. And I believe he will do that.\n\n\u201cOne of the duties of a president is to protect the law of the land. And when an issue comes to an issue of judgment the duty is incumbent on the government of the day to ensure that justice is done.\n\n\u201cI came to demand justice that he should prevail and as the custodian, as the leader of our nation, he should be made to know that such is going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to say I don\u2019t want to be investigated by the EFCC. That\u2019s not the issue, that there\u2019s a judgment on the ground.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s judgment and there\u2019s an order of court that I\u2019m asking Mr President, who appointed the EFCC to recall that there was the law that established the EFCC. And if that law is good to make somebody EFCC, that law should be obeyed, too.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he believes his suffering was planned by his opponents, the former governor of Imo said: \u201cI suspect so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I say it is politically-motivated means that some people are instigating the EFCC to do this, which is wrong. All I\u2019m asking from the EFCC is to please obey the law,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot refuse to obey the law on one side, and then go for the law on the other side. So, if EFCC obeys the law, it will be the best thing they can do for the image of the EFCC and the image of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut as to who particularly, the person must be such a coward who doesn\u2019t want to expose himself. And there are people like that who wouldn\u2019t want to expose themselves but stay under doing all kinds of things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy suspicion at this point is immaterial. What is more important is that the EFCC should obey a simple court judgment and court order, as the case may be.\u201d",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Say hello, and we\u2019ll share a fun article with you \ud83d\ude04\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Founded in 2016 by Niklas Adalberth, one of the founders of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, Norrsken Foundation was set up to help entrepreneurs solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges through its Norrsken House, a Stockholm-based co-working space for over 350 impact entrepreneurs, the Norrsken Founders Fund, and Norrsken VC.\n\nIn 2019, the foundation set up a base in Rwanda, through which it planned to invest across the East and Central African region. Last year, it accepted 11 African startups into the inaugural Norrsken Impact Accelerator.\n\nNorrsken is now working with Hans Otterling, partner at Northzone, and an investment team led by Natalie Kolbe, ex global head of private equity at Actis in South Africa; Actis colleague Ngetha Waithaka in Kenya; and Lexi Novitske, founder of Acuity Venture Partners, on the new Norrsken22 Africa Tech Growth Fund.\n\nThe fund, backed by 30 unicorn founders, contributing their skills and $65 million in funding, announced its first close of $110 million on Tuesday. Olugbenga Agboola, co-founder of Flutterwave and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of Skype are some of these backers. Norrsken22 is managed by a team of general partners involved in the African tech ecosystem, with decades of experience supporting entrepreneurs in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Novitske to discuss the inspiration behind Norrsken22, its investment criteria, the current venture capital landscape in Africa, and what sectors she thinks the next set of African unicorn startups will emerge from.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: What inspired the move to back growth-stage startups in Africa?\n\nNovitske: Through my firm Acuity (and its predecessor Singularity Investments) we were active investors in early-stage companies across Africa. We co-invested with many other local investors. What we saw was that, as our companies scaled across the continent there was not sufficient local capital to back these growth-stage rounds. Our investee companies like Mono, Flutterwave, mPharma were pushed to take time away from their business on the ground to travel to Silicon Valley and educate international investors about the Africa growth story. These same investors have certainly seized the opportunity, but their capital can only go so far in providing the value these companies need to scale. This was the obvious missing middle to me \u2013 be the partner that these companies can leverage to lock down the best customers, identify the best local talent, and provide regulatory, cultural, and strategy expertise when scaling from one African market to another.\n\nMichael: Norrsken22 has 30 unicorn founders and a local advisory council board comprising leading African business figures. What was it like getting everyone on board?\n\nNovitske: Our Unicorn Board members are an incredible resource for our fund. These successful founders of billion-dollar-plus businesses are all committing capital as investors, but beyond that, they are committing their time and network to unlock the toughest challenges some of our partner companies might face. They\u2019ve been through the experience of scaling similar businesses in other markets, and may even end up being strategic partners for our companies. Likewise, our Advisory Council has built some of the largest businesses traversing the African continent and has insights and connections that are invaluable to our companies. Some of these individuals are excited to share their insights to create the next generation of entrepreneurs. For others, they understand that Africa tech is one of the great investment opportunities of our time and want to play an active role in building value for their investment interests. And for others it\u2019s more strategic: they see Africa as a market that they would like to expand their business into through partnerships or acquisitions, and they want to start building these relationships now.\n\nMichael: What are the investment criteria at Norrsken22? What will make you consider a startup for investment?\n\nNovitske: We have taken a narrow focus on our investment criteria. Not because we don\u2019t believe there are no other attractive investment opportunities outside of our mandate, but because we want to be absolutely the best at what we do. Our resources are dedicated to backing companies from the Series A to C rounds, with real customers, repeatable revenue, attractive unit economics, and in our primary markets and sectors. These primary markets are Nigeria, Ghana, Southern Africa, and Eastern Africa. This is also where we have a team on the ground that can really identify and support our partner companies. It\u2019s important to mention that we have set aside approximately half of our funds to support our portfolio champions throughout their lifecycle. Innovation success stories sometimes take time to unlock, and we are committed to being there for the journey.\n\nMichael: Where (what sectors) do you think the next set of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups will emerge from?\n\nNovitske: We believe the most scalable opportunities today are in fintech, market enablement, healthtech, and edutech. These are also the sectors that we believe are solving some of Africa\u2019s key societal problems. Market enablement includes software, marketplaces, and APIs [Application Programming Interface] that are unlocking more efficient trade, logistics, and customer engagement. We are especially excited about the crossover of these two sectors in areas such as embedded finance. And I do not believe everything has already been done in fintech \u2013 there are many opportunities still to be unlocked!\n\nMichael: What\u2019s your impression of the current VC landscape in Africa?\n\nNovitske: I am very excited by the transformation I have seen in the VC landscape on the continent; but even more excited by the energy of the tech entrepreneurs. There are really great teams building need-to-have products for a very large market opportunity, and frankly not enough capital to support their ambitions. Early-stage investors like Ventures Platform, 4dx, and Rabo (and some successful Africa tech angels) have done an incredible job investing and supporting early-stage companies, but there is still a dearth of capital at the growth stage on the continent. In 2021, there were only 114 deals that had larger than $5 million rounds; compared with the total 818 deals done on the continent above $100k (as per Briter Bridges). That number drops off sharply when you\u2019re looking at deals over $10 million.\n\nLexi Novitske (down-left) in the Norrsken22 team. Image credit: Supplied\n\nMichael: There is still some lethargy on the side of African and Africa-based investors. Are there any implications for the ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Entrepreneurs are the machine that drives the growth in tech ecosystems, but investors are the oil. An investors\u2019 job is to provide resources behind the top teams to help them realise their company\u2019s potential, and resources is NOT just cash. Local investors have insights from doing businesses on the continent or networks that no international investor can have, even if they have the deepest pockets. We have started to see real exits happen and real money flowing in, and Africa-based investors are getting excited. I think the more local capital and expertise that can be deployed, the faster we will realise the evolution of sustainable ecosystems, wealth creation, and access to scalable services to empower the mass population on the continent.\n\nMichael: How can we drive even more local VC participation in the startup ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Africa has a population of 1.2 billion, where 60% are below 25 years old. In the next decade, this young, digital-first generation will change the world. Technology is enabling the region to leapfrog legacy industries and is pivoting key sectors. I believe it\u2019s obvious that the emerging tech ecosystem in Africa offers one of the great investment opportunities of our time. If that isn\u2019t reason enough for VC participation, I\u2019m not sure what is.\n\nI also want to applaud the ecosystem builders that are working on initiatives that make doing business easier for startups, including the StartUp Bill in Nigeria, and similar initiatives in Kenya and South Africa. I should also highlight that the Norrsken Foundation will re-invest its portion of the capital generated by Norrsken22 back into supporting entrepreneurship, to further promote the growth of the African tech ecosystem and a new generation of tech founders.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIG Logistics (GIGL) has been showing interest in the crypto economy. In September 2021, we got wind of the company\u2019s plan to add an option that enables customers to pay for logistics services with crypto.\n\nWe speculated that the company would create its crypto token to be used as a means of payment and investment in GIGL. We concluded that the company would have its crypto token, which would grow in value because of the practical use case, consequently becoming a huge revenue stream.\n\nWhile our speculations missed the mark, our sources were spot on.\n\nGIGL has integrated a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO. Users can now perform basic crypto transactions such as buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe integration will be done in two initial beta phases before it is available to the public. The first beta phase will see the crypto wallet opened to 2,000 users, with up to 10,000 users having access in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is in partnership with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets with crypto. XPAD users can import their XPAD wallet into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those without an XPAD wallet can create one directly on GIGGO.\n\nA ploy to onboard users for XPAD?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Ocholi Etu, Director, Operational Services Hub, integrating a crypto wallet into the GIGGO app \u201caligns with the company\u2019s long-standing strategy to be at the forefront of innovation.\u201d\n\nWhile it might be interesting to see crypto payments on the GIGGO app, the wallet integration only helps to perform basic crypto functions.\n\nThe wallet, an extension of the app, is not directly connected to the services offered on the app; it can only be used for buying, selling, storing, and transferring crypto.\n\nAlthough the company claims the integration gives users more things to do with the app, the onboarding process ensures that users without an XPAD account create one, a way to onboard GIGGO users to XPAD.\n\nEven though the connection between GIGL and XPAD is not clearly defined, GIGL is one of the app\u2019s supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXPAD supporters\n\nWith several crypto exchanges offering the same services as XPAD, GIGGO, with over 100,000 users on Google Play, presents an innovative way to onboard users to the platform; XPAD, on the other hand, has over 500 users on Google Play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, the crypto space has been associated with scams, making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use. Connecting XPAD, a new platform with GIGL, a trusted company, creates a sense of security.\n\nWith GIGL entering the crypto space, one can safely speculate that it might be creating its crypto token. The wallet, which currently supports only Bitcoin, USDT and CFX might also be GIGL\u2019s way of preparing its users for crypto payments.\n\nOn why it is important to drive crypto adoption, Etu explained that crypto could make payments easier, and GIGL is only playing its role in accelerating crypto adoption, which could be the next phase of finance globally.\n\nAn innovative way to join the crypto payments race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Fundera, 15,174 businesses accept Bitcoin as payment globally, including notable companies like US tech company, Microsoft, and American movie theatre chain, AMC.\n\nIn Africa, cryptocurrencies are mostly used for speculative purposes \u2014 trading and hodling. But they are also known to be used because of the ease they bring to cross-border transactions.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity as a means of payment, many businesses are yet to accept them. However, GIGL believes this could change with time and wants to prepare its users for it.\n\nThe preparation model, however, might be one of the most innovative yet. While it can be argued that the wallet integration does not directly improve the app, it could be a great way to introduce cryptocurrencies to non-crypto users.\n\nWith only a fraction of the world\u2019s population using crypto, businesses have very little incentive to accept crypto payments. Nevertheless, GIGL is innovatively driving adoption through its platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAn unconventional investing style\n\nAffordable insurance in Nigeria\n\nAfya Rekod\u2019s $2m raise\n\nAn untapped investment style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only logical that most investors and venture capital firms invest in a startup capable of scaling. Their investments should yield the desired results.\n\nTo manage the risk of investing in startups that might not scale, most investors look at assets and balance sheets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Untapped Global knows startups with promising futures might not always have impressive balance sheets or assets. That is why it uses a tech called the Internet of Things (IoT) as its risk management strategy.\n\nInternet of what? This means connecting physical objects to the Internet, for example, a fitness tracker or an air conditioner that can be controlled over the Internet.\n\nUntapped Global could, for example, loan out a bicycle to Chimgozirim (who I doubt knows how to ride a bicycle) to deliver puff puffs. Instead of looking for data that shows Chimgozirim is an expert at delivering puff puffs, they give him the bicycle and track his progress with IoT. Within a few weeks, they can tell if he\u2019s a good investment or not.\n\nBut does this work in all cases?\n\nWell, Chimgozirim had a chat with Jim Chu, Founder of Untapped Global, and he revealed the details of the VC\u2019s unconventional investment style. Please read it here: How Untapped Global backs growth stage African startups by using smart asset financing\n\nInsurance is not a thing in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap between the rate of insurance penetration in many parts of Africa and most Western countries is probably more expansive than the physical distance between both regions.\n\nPer Statista, as of 2020, 91.4% of Americans have health insurance. This is in sharp contrast to Africa\u2019s insurance penetration rate, which stood at 2.78% in 2019. In Nigeria, over 97% of the population does not have any form of health insurance.\n\nWhy is this the case? According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, health insurance in Nigeria, besides government programmes, is expensive for the average citizen. Nigeria ranked as the third-highest country with the most out-of-pocket health spending in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nThere\u2019s an opportunity here: With very few people insured in the country, there is an untapped insurance market to take advantage of.\n\nCasava has raised $4 million in pre-seed funding to take advantage of Nigeria\u2019s untapped insurance market.\n\nLed by Target Global with participation from other investors, including Shola Akinlade, Paystack Co-Founder and Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, the startup wants to offer Nigerians affordable income and health insurance.\n\nLicensed as Nigeria\u2019s first microinsurance underwriter, Casava offers income protection for as low as $1 per month. Subscribers will get paid monthly for six months if they lose their job or become unable to work.\n\nWith subscriptions available via the website or mobile app, it will be interesting to see Casava\u2019s impact on insurance in Nigeria. Perhaps insurance could become a thing in the country through the startup.\n\nAfya Rekod\u2019s $2m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\nKenyan health data platform Afya Rekod has closed a $2 million seed round led by Mac Venture Capital.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup allows patients and hospitals to access, store, and track a patient\u2019s health data.\n\nLaunched in April 2020, it also performs other functions like hospital management and inventory management.\n\nThe founder, John Kamara, said the startup is \u201cfocused on building a dynamic platform that streamlines health records with analytics and provides access to specialised clinics and experts.\u201d\n\nThe fund will be essential to Afya Rekod\u2019s growth as its goal is to become the leading patient mobility-focused health platform in the world.\n\nHealthtech in Africa: While healthtech is nowhere near fintech for massive funding rounds, it is still a force to be reckoned with in the African tech ecosystem. In 2021, it came in second to fintech.\n\nThe sector is also displaying exciting innovations that could make it even more attractive to investors.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTeen Who Demanded $50,000 From Elon Musk Is Now Targeting More Billionaire Jets.

          "title": "How Untapped Global backs growth stage African startups by using smart asset financing",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump aggressively pursued an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy as he sought to \u201creturn\u201d the US to its place as the dominant power in the world. Consequently, there was a reduction in aid to developing countries.\n\nIn 2021, the United Kingdom also announced that aid to African countries would be reduced by 66%. This followed a trend of less money in aid flowing to developing countries, including African countries.\n\nFor a long time, discussions about development in Africa usually revolved around aids. That approach has not particularly paid off, with experts believing it has fostered a culture of dependency. However, African tech seems to be changing all that with venture-backed investments increasing due to amazing levels of innovation across the continent.\n\nAs a volunteer in Nigeria with Doctors Without Borders \u2014 a non-profit organisation committed to providing medical personnel to underserved areas \u2014 Jim Chu believed that volunteering with development organisations was his way of impacting the world. However, he soon realised that helping businesses access the funds they need to grow their operations was a better option. That realisation led him to start Untapped Global in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe created Untapped to fill a hole that I saw as an investor and as an entrepreneur over and over again in Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, and other places. Some people call that hole \u2018The valley of death\u2019 or \u2018The missing level\u2019, but it\u2019s the space where you\u2019re no longer a very early startup, but you\u2019re also not a very well established company. You\u2019re in-between, and companies at this stage find it difficult to raise capital; it\u2019s even harder if you\u2019re outside the traditional investment thesis,\u201d Chu says.\n\nDemocratising prosperity using smart asset financing\n\nWith most venture capital going to companies that can scale at astronomical rates, such as fintech, other companies find it challenging to raise funds even though they can create great value. Untapped Global was founded to fill this gap. Unlike typical investment strategies, Untapped Global funds assets that can create economic value.\n\nFor example, imagine a young man, Taiwo, from a village in Southern Nigeria, who has just moved to Lagos. Without an education, he is unable to get a good job. Also, his lack of credit history means he cannot get a loan to start a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexClub is one of Untapped Global\u2019s portfolio companies\n\nUsing data from IoT devices, a company backed by Untapped Global could give Taiwo a tricycle for commercial transportation. The tricycle would be monitored to know how well Taiwo utilises this asset. If he does not use it profitably, the company retrieves it and gives it to someone else. Untapped Global invests in these companies and, in return, receives a percentage of the business\u2019 revenue.\n\nChu explains how Untapped Global works.\n\n\u201cThe conventional way of managing risk is, \u2018Show me your balance sheets. Show me the assets you have.\u2019 So you have a house, and you take a loan against the house, and we sign a lot of papers so that if you don\u2019t pay me back, we send a lot of lawyers to make sure you pay me back or I take over your house.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has a house or asset that can be collateralised, but everyone has the energy. So what we do, instead, is we use data to say, \u2018Okay, you don\u2019t have a house, but you can drive a motorcycle. The asset we give you is the motorcycle, and we use IoT to track that motorcycle using the data you generate from it to manage the risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the firm does not only use smart asset financing as an investment tool, having made equity investments in startups like Opibus, an electric vehicle company in Kenya; Nigerian fintech startup, Paga; Flexclub, a car financing company in South Africa; Eden Life; OnePipe; Inspira Farms; and Asaak, a company providing financing services for motorbikes in Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much does Untapped Global invest?\n\nWith a slightly different investment model, Untapped Global has no average ticket size. Instead, it invests between $50,000 and $3 million in its portfolio companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no average ticket size because our due diligence process is tied up in the ticket sizes,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Water ATM in Kenya\n\nTypically, after a company indicates interest in being funded by an investor, the investor carries out a due diligence process to ascertain if the company is worth investing in. Untapped Global does this differently.\n\nInstead of a regular due diligence process, the firm launches a pilot where it finances a business\u2019 assets, starting with $50,000 or more. The pilot could last for a few weeks, and they make an investment decision based on the data gotten from the process.\n\nBiggest mistakes startups make\n\nDeciding to start a business is signing up for uncertainty. As a result, even the most experienced founders could make mistakes. Chu believes that one of the biggest mistakes African founders make is not knowing what type of capital they need for their business.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of startup founders make the mistake of using equity capital when they should be using non-dilutive debt or other kinds of non-equity capital to run their business. If you\u2019re a software startup, you don\u2019t need that much CapEx, but if you\u2019re an asset-heavy company using equity investments, you\u2019re going to run out of cap table at some point.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn bad investments, missed opportunities, and successes\n\nEven with strict adherence to a due diligence process, venture financing can still go wrong. With several businesses not making it to the five-year mark, many businesses funded by venture capitalists are likely to fail. Untapped Global\u2019s unconventional investment methods means that it could detect a bad investment within weeks by testing the waters before making a permanent commitment.\n\n\u201cOur data helps us to detect a bad investment in as little as a few weeks, and because we give out small amounts of money, we can cut off the financing whenever we like,\u201d Chu reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, traditional VC firms may have to wait a few months before realising that an investment won\u2019t go according to plan. While Untapped Global has been funding startups for barely two years, Chu lists FlexClub, Paga, and Asaak as some of their biggest successes.\n\nMost investors in Africa invest in various industries, but Chu says Untapped Global is focused on mobility, water infrastructure, and energy. Its investment method also means that its investments are not tied to particular funding rounds.\n\nSo, if you have a business that already generates revenue in any of these industries, you can apply to get funded by sending an email to deals@untappedglobal.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s young drive gaming market revolution",
          "text": "As Africa\u2019s gaming industry sees continuous growth, Nigeria happens to be one of the leading nations in terms of gaming activities, revenues, and the number of people playing games.\n\nThis is as a result of the country\u2019s massive youthful population as well as increased access to smartphones and more internet adoption.\n\nAccording to a Renaissance Capital report, at the end of year 2021, 23 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population was involved in playing games, while the industry recorded $185 million in the same year.\n\nExperts say the growth recorded in the accessibility of smartphones in Nigeria is a reason for the popularity of smartphone gaming. Mobile games including the King of Avalon, PUBG, Call of Duty, and Clash of Kings, while football (FIFA) is the most played soccer game on PlayStation (PS) console, and are becoming more popular among Nigerians.\n\nOther popular games on the PS console include God of War, Grand Theft Auto (GTA), Mortal Kombat, Assassin Creed, Need for Speed, among others.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, Candy Crush used to be the most played game but now that mobile phones, as well as the internet, are more accessible to the younger generation, Call of Duty, PUBG mobile have become the two most-played games in Nigeria,\u201d Odysseus Vrakas, a game expert, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe trends seen in Nigeria\u2019s gaming industry are another reason for traction. While some games need a higher-end device to make them function, majority do not require an advanced technology-enabled phone.\n\nAccording to Vrakas, a majority of online games are widely compatible with 90 percent of mobile devices.\n\nAnother important trend is the amount of data online games consume. \u201cThese games consume very little data. As everyone is conscious of their data, no one wants to play a game that will burn all their data,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nThere has been a forecast of how the gaming industry will yield more revenue as the year unfolds. In an exclusive interview with the CEOs of Nigeria\u2019s largest mobile operator, MTN, Ralph Mupita explained how much revenue they see in the digital space, including in the gaming industry.\n\n\u201cDigital for us is a very interesting revenue stream. You see dynamics coming through music, gaming and video, gaming is coming on quite interesting across some of our markets and has become a big driver for revenue for some of the tables,\u201d Mupita said.\n\nWhile the industry will see more revenues, an upcoming trend known as \u2018play to earn\u2019 has been attributed to being a major drive. This trend will also enable game players to benefit monetarily as they will earn money while they play.\n\n\u201cThere are games like the Metaverse Guild that introduce play to earn games. These games enable you to earn coins, which can translate to real-world money because it is based on cryptocurrency,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nAccording to public sources, gaming content providers like Gameloft, Intralot, and Sirplay have partnered local gaming companies to participate in the growing success of the gaming industry by providing technology services and support.\n\nTo enjoy more gaming services and opportunities in Nigeria, experts say the government should put the right policies and regulations in place, including the introduction of a special data access package for gamers.\n\nRead also: Will the prices of cooking gas ever come down in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cMost telecom companies have streaming plans for YouTube, and that has made access easier and helps to not burn all your data on videos. As such, there should also be gaming plans to help reduce the cost of data. For example, Call of Duty is about two Gigabits (GB) in size and the updates are usually large in size. So, as much as people play it, the data consumption might sometimes discourage others,\u201d Vrakas said.\n\nAs gaming continues to thrive among the youths and other interested parties, one-way operators can ensure addiction is managed by enforcing age limits. Others include introducing a unified body that organises competition and promotes game streaming as well as competitions. Gaming should be moved from just a hobby to a career opportunity for both developers and gamers, experts say.",

          "title": "Retail rebounds after 7-year decline",
          "text": "After recording seven straight years of decline, Nigeria\u2019s total retail sales improved marginally by 3 percent to $108 billion in 2021, according to a new report.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI), Nigeria\u2019s total sales had been trending south falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015. But in 2021, it rose to $108 billion.\n\nAnalysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, say the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19, with GDP growth in 2021 expected to be about 2.5 percent and about 2.7 percent in 2022.\n\n\u201cThis growth is underpinned by recent government measures including social schemes, cash transfer programmes, and proposed ramped-up spending of $39.7 billion in 2022 by the government. Real household spending growth is expected to accelerate in 2021\u2014growing 1.4 percent year-over-year, up from about 0.9 percent year-over-year growth in 2020,\u201d they further note.\n\nThe index ranks 35 emerging countries based on a set of 26 factors, including four key variables: country risk, market attractiveness, market saturation, and sales growth. Data for 2018 and 2019 were absent as the firm now produces it bi-yearly.\n\nAlthough Nigeria improved in its sales, its ranking dropped by four places to 34th position, scoring 91.9 for market saturation followed by 22.2 for time pressure, 14.8 for market attractiveness and 14.4 for country risk. Its total average score was 39.4 from 35.6 in 2019.\n\nThe ranking further highlighted Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Senegal and Kenya as the top five African countries scoring 52.2, 52.0, 51.9, 48.3 and 45.1, respectively.\n\nWholesale and retail trade is the second biggest sector by output production. It can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.\n\nThe sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development, as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.\n\nBut in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative growth territory since 2016 over myriad challenges e.g. macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira\u2019s depreciation, weak purchasing power and household incomes. But it returned to positive growth in Q2 \u20182021, ending eighth consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\nA recent report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria\u2019s real household consumption as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post pandemic for Nigeria\u2019s consumer\u2019s industry.\n\n\u201cPeople have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones. Also, e-commerce has made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy,\u201d Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at the Lagos Business School, states.\n\nUzo also adds that since the pandemic, new forms of retail have developed such as retail on demand and On-the-Go type, which has now become more accessible to people.\n\nBefore the two recessions experienced in the last five years, Nigeria\u2019s retail sector was once a formidable consumer market due to a fast-growing middle class, rising consumer income and urbanisation, which made it an attractive retail investment destination for local and foreign investors.\n\nRead also: Buhari\u2019s APC has ruined nation\u2019s economy -NASS member\n\nBut increasing cost of business, inflation and volatility made foreign retailers exit the country e.g Truworths, Mr. Price, Shoprite and Massmart.\n\n\u201cConsumer demand is the fulcrum of retail performance and this had impacted adversely on their performance,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says.\n\nBut last year, Burger King, the world\u2019s second-biggest burger chain, came to Nigeria to set up stores despite the tough business environment.\n\nApart from Burger King, other retailers that have invested and entered the country recently include Swarovski and South Africa\u2019s Pick n Pay. \u201cInternational brands such as Mango, Zara, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, and Nike operate in Nigeria under franchise agreements,\u201d analysts at Kearney note.\n\nThey also note that e-commerce, an up-and-coming channel in Nigeria, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13 to 15 percent from 2020 to 2025, with the high growth being attributed to the fast-growing and youthful population, which are more accustomed to buying online.",

          "text": "Nigeria would need three times more fiber infrastructure than it currently has to reach the Nation Broadband Plan (NBP) target set by 2025.\n\nTo meet the target, the country needs roughly between 120,000 to 167,000 km of fiber infrastructure, in addition to the 55,000 km set at the cost of $3.4 billion. Urgent deployment of fibre infrastructure is critical to the success of upcoming national events like the 2023 elections and the successful commercialisation of 5G technology.\n\nAbout 23 percent of Nigerians use broadband services and 36 percent of the population has internet access, according to reports.\n\nThe average cost to fix broadbands has been known to round up to $80 per month making internet access unaffordable to most households With the high cost of the Internet and mobile connectivity, SMEs face poor quality in internet service, impacting their efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe amount for fiber development cost is approximately $870 million and an estimated $2.5 billion for 10 years cost of Right of Way(ROW) fees, which would be payable by operators deploying the fiber if current ROW fees remain in place.\n\nIf the ROW charges by all states are reduced to N145 per meter, then the cost of dark fiber deployment including ROW fees would decline dramatically from $3.4 billion to $1 billion as the DCF of 10 ROW fees would decrease from $2.5 billion to approx. $150 million.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, Karl Toriola CEO MTN Nigeria, gave his comment on Stae governors who have agreed to the Right of Way pricing and are open for fiber infrastructure.\n\nRead also: IXPN moves to improve quality of internet in Kano\n\n\u201cWe have to give a lot of credit to the honorable minister for being extremely progressive in accelerating the pace of advancement in the telecoms industry,\u201d Toriola said \u201cRight of way, for example, is one of them. Some states have leaned into the right away pricing as requested by the minister, and we\u2019re investing aggressively in those states.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor other states, it\u2019s within the jurisdiction and right of the state governors to decide how they want to manage that policy. I think over time, as we see the ICT progress of the states that have opened up to fiber infrastructure and the right of way, a lot more states will come into the fold,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe, without a doubt, need fiber capacity to provide the backhaul for 5G, and if you\u2019re ready for 4G, it helps the quality of service.\u201d\n\nThe lack of an open-access wholesale network, combined with inefficient wholesale access regulation, different Federal and State taxes, and expensive rights-of-way costs, continues to hinder investment in the industry.\n\nNigeria, unlike its West African neighbors Ghana and Senegal, lacks a widespread, open-access national backbone network through which high-speed Internet connectivity can be expanded across the country at a reasonable cost. As a result, most Nigerian telecommunications companies continue to build their infrastructure.\n\nThis has resulted in excessive expenditures, with high-traffic intercity routes frequently having three or more fiber-optic cables while others have none. Excessive rights of way (ROW) fees, as well as federal and state levies from a variety of government agencies and departments, have artificially raised the price of this much-needed deployment.\n\nOnly roughly 7 states out of 36 have consented to use the N145 per meter ROW tariff, with governments such as Benue, Ogun, and Lagos charging N2,500, N4,000, and N750 per linear meter as of 2021.\n\nEven then, several of these states have converted the ROW costs that were previously abolished into new administrative fees that telecom operators must pay.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, about $900 million in ROW fees could be paid yearly to deploy the fiber needed to meet the NBP penetration rate targets while removing the impediment that these high and unclear payments pose to the government\u2019s ambitions.",

          "text": "Peoples Gazette has discovered connections between Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s law firm SimmonsCooper Partners and Bola Tinubu\u2019s money-laundering front, Ocean Trust Limited, according to bank data obtained by the publication.\n\nAccording to the data, Ocean Trust Limited sent N25,001,050 to SimmonsCooper Partners\u2019 UBA bank account on April 26, 2013, contradicting SimmonsCooper\u2019s emphatic public statement in July 2019 that it had no involvement with Ocean Trust in any form or for any purpose. Mr. Osinbajo was likewise absolved of any knowledge of Ocean Trust\u2019s existence, according to the firm.\n\nWhen presidential spokesman Garba Shehu identified assets of President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice in September 2015, one of Mr Osinbajo\u2019s businesses was SimmonsCooper Partners, a white-shoe law firm based in Victoria Island.\n\nDapo Apara, the former managing director of Alpha Beta Consulting, accused Mr Tinubu, the ruling party\u2019s leader and a presidential candidate in 2023, of corruption and money laundering in 2018. Between 1999 through 2007, Mr. Tinubu was governor of Lagos, while Mr. Osinbajo served as the state\u2019s attorney general. In 2007, Mr. Osinbajo founded SimmonsCooper Partners with a group of associates.\n\nOcean Trust was identified in Mr Apara\u2019s court records as one of the entities allegedly used to drain monies from Alpha-Beta, the notorious Lagos tax contractor whose financial operations have come under scrutiny as a result of The Gazette\u2019s ongoing investigations.\n\nFollowing Mr Apara\u2019s charges, The Gazette obtained bank papers demonstrating how Mr Tinubu was funneling billions of dollars from Lagos\u2019 coffers through Alpha Beta and then into Ocean Trust, a business with no traceable address.\n\nAccording to our findings, Ocean Trust transferred N16.4 billion from its operational accounts to a fixed deposit account at Wema Bank between January and June 2019. Yemi Adefarakan, executive director and group finance officer of Continental Broadcasting Service, which owns TVC News and other associated media businesses in Lagos and Abuja, handled the transactions.\n\nTVC\u2019s 2013 growth was supported with monies via Ocean Trust, an onshore shell firm that provides no services, according to additional bank filings. When The Gazette contacted Jonathan Zwingina and Kehinde Durosimi-Eti, two of the three people whose names appeared on Ocean Trust\u2019s company registration files, they denied knowing anything about the company. On the CAC filings, Mr Adefarakan is the third name.\n\nAccording to Mr. Apara, Alpha Beta received about N150 billion from Lagos, the majority of which went to Ocean Trust. Mr Tinubu continues to dodge inquiries about his stake in Alpha Beta, although cash sent to the firm from Lagos government accounts have been linked to his family, commercial interests, and political associates behind the scenes.\n\nThe evidence was presented to SimmonsCooper via phone calls, emails, and letters over several weeks, but the firm declined to reply.\n\nAbidemi Oseni-Oduntan, a former partner at the law firm that handled the firm\u2019s bank accounts, was contacted by the Gazette. He claimed to knowing about Ocean Trust at first, but then called back to say he didn\u2019t know about it and threatened to sue our publication if the story was published.\n\nBabatunde Irukera, a former partner at SimmonsCooper until 2017, when he was appointed to chair the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, was also reached by the Gazette (FCCPC). Despite repeated attempts to get Mr Irukera to take a definite stance, he refused to affirm or accept knowledge of Ocean Trust during his years at SimmonsCooper.\n\nMr. Osinbajo\u2019s office declined to comment on the newly discovered evidence linking Ocean Trust to SimmonsCooper when the vice-president was a senior partner there at the time.\n\nWema Bank\u2019s representative did not respond to inquiries for comment on the bank\u2019s role in moving billions of dollars for a corporation that only exists on paper \u2014 or whether the transactions were disclosed to federal authorities.\n\nTwo peas in a pod\n\nLast month, Mr Tinubu announced plans to run for president in 2023, saying he had informed Mr Buhari of his readiness to succeed him. About a week earlier, Mr Osinbajo also informed the president of his intention to take the top job.\n\nBoth camps have been pitted against one another in recent weeks, with Mr Osinbajo\u2019s adviser Babafemi Ojudu publicly denouncing support for Mr Tinubu, a decision he said had earned him criticism and attacks from the politician\u2019s supporters.\n\nComposite of Osinbanjo, Tinubu and Ojudu\n\nBut notwithstanding their political differences ahead of a close primary contest later this year, Messrs Osinbajo and Tinubu are still widely seen as allies, especially given their steep history, said anti-corruption and political analyst Shola Olubanjo.\n\n\u201cWhat these latest revelations tell us is that both Tinubu and Osinbajo are two peas in a pod,\u201d Mr Olubanjo said. \u201cThey have both been working together as partners for many years and Nigerians should not be deceived.\u201d\n\nAfter concluding his tenure as Lagos\u2019 attorney-general, Mr Osinbajo continued to serve Mr Tinubu in several capacities, including as political and legal aide. His loyalty was rewarded in 2015 when Mr Tinubu nominated him as running mate to Mr Buhari.\n\n\u201cIf they can be that close, then you know they will go to any length to cover up the shady deals they\u2019ve done together,\u201d Mr Olubanjo said. \u201cWhatever they do in the coming months to get the presidential ticket, no one should expect them to open long-buried secrets of each other\u2019s corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nSource: People Gazette",

          "text": "The Federal Government says it has uncovered 96 financiers of terrorism across the country, especially those backing Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThis was disclosed by Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, during a press conference on the administration\u2019s fight against corruption in Abuja on Thursday, February 3.\n\nHe said the \u201cNigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria,\u201d while 424 associates and supporters of the financiers were also uncovered.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Insurgency] Northeast Will Witness A Change In The Coming Months \u2013 Buhari\n\nAlso, about 123 companies and 33 Bureau de change, were linked to terrorists in addition to 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and seven co-conspirators who have now been identified.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cthe analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets\u201d.\n\nStill, on terrorism financing, Lai Mohammed said the NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping, and others with 19 countries.\n\nDuring the same period, 2020-2021, the organization returned fraudulently-obtained funds totaling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore dollar, and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\n\nREAD FULL TEXT OF MINISTER\u2019S BRIEFING\n\nTEXT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ADDRESSED BY THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI LAI MOHAMMED, ON THE ADMINISTRATION\u2019S FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ABUJA ON THURSDAY, FEB. 3RD 2022\n\nGood afternoon gentlemen and happy new year, since this is our first meeting this year. And as always, I thank you for honouring our invitation.\n\n2. As you are aware, one of the three major policy planks of this Administration is the fight against corruption, with the others of course being to tackle insecurity and also to revamp the economy. We will be having a series of thematic press conferences on these issues in the days ahead, with this one \u2013 on the fight against corruption \u2013 being the first one.\n\n3. It is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the Administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts. Let me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture \u2013 which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure success in tackling corruption, constitute \u2013 as important as they are \u2013 just a part of the strategies to combat corruption. There is also a more fundamental strategy, which I will describe as structural and governance reforms or, if you like, institutional reforms. Today\u2019s press conference will therefore look at this fundamental strategy and also highlight the successes recorded in recent times by the various anti-corruption agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB).\n\n4. Gentlemen, the Buhari Administration has taken bold measures to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes in the implementation of government policies, check corrupt practices and ensure accountability in the implementation as well as delivery of these policies. These reforms are all inclusive, cutting across all spheres of governance and not excluding even the private sector. They are the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), Petroleum Industry Act, Financial Autonomy for State Legislature and Judiciary (2020), Whistle-Blower Policy, Assets Recovery, Justice and Law reforms, Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Open Government Partnership as well as the various instruments at the disposal of the Federal Government to track, trace and stop the flow of illicit funds used in financing terrorist activities within Nigeria, among others. For those who may say that some of these reforms, like the TSA, predate this Administration, our response is that what\u2019s the use of a policy that is not implemented? This Administration has implemented these reforms with fidelity, and the reforms have made a huge impact in preventing corruption.\n\n5. For example, upon assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari operationalized the TSA, a public accounting system that enables the Government to manage its finances (revenues and payments) using a single/unified account or a series of linked accounts domiciled at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The President issued a directive to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to close their accounts with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and transfer the funds therein to the CBN on or before 15th September 2015. The TSA system was launched in 2012 but failed to gain traction until President Buhari gave it a fillip. The TSA system has now been implemented in more than 90 percent of all Federal MDAs and it has resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across Deposit Money Banks in the country, and monthly savings of an average of N4 billion in bank charges.\n\n6. Also, against stiff opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded the coverage of IPPIS. TSA and IPPIS remain an unfolding revolution in public finance in Nigeria that have incorporated transparency and accountability into the system. The use of BVN to verify the Federal Government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform has so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries. The Federal Government has also utilized the BVN system to verify beneficiaries and vendors in the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), the N-Power Programme and the Home Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP), among others.\n\n7. The Whistle-blower Policy is an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning. The policy is meant to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information about fraud, bribery and looted government funds, including financial misconduct and any other form of corruption or theft. The Whistle Blower whose information leads to recovery is entitled to 2.5 to 5% from the recovered funds. Information and tips received are usually referred to the EFCC, ICPC, and NFIU for further painstaking investigation. The policy has helped in the cleansing of IPPIS, led to compliance on TSA and enhanced the Procurement Act 2007. As at 2020, a total sum of N700 billion has been recovered through the Whistle-Blower Policy.\n\n8 Then, there is the Petroleum Industry Act (2021). As you are aware, there has been a dire need for Nigeria to reform the laws of its oil & gas sector, which accounts for 90% of its foreign exchange earnings and about 65% of government\u2019s revenue. While some of the laws had become outdated and unsuited to the 21st century, some were simply non-existent to regulate certain activities, thereby providing loopholes to be exploited by corrupt practitioners. One of such is the P&ID case in which a company registered in a foreign tax haven colluded with corrupt officials over a set-to-fail gas processing project to secure about $10 billion award against the Nigerian government via an arbitration process abroad. Attempts to revamp petroleum laws by successive governments proved futile for over 20 years until President Muhammadu Buhari broke the jinx to push through the Petroleum Industry Act in 2021, through strong will and determination.\n\n9. Gentlemen, President Muhammadu Buhari signed an Executive Order in May 2020 that unequivocally granted financial autonomy to State Houses of Assembly, State Judiciaries as well as the Local Governments, as the third tier of government. The order also mandated the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct, from source, funds due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation of states that fail to comply. Lack of financial autonomy for the separate arms of government at the state level is a major structural flaw that is in need of reform, and this has been addressed by the Buhari Administration. Also, the financial suffocation of LGs is a major enabler of insecurity and terrorism in the Nigerian countryside.\n\nMost of Nigeria\u2019s 774 LGAs exist in rural areas where effective local governance is an existential issue. To underscore their responsibility to the people, President Buhari recently reminded the LG Chairmen of their burden of accounting for every kobo allocated to their Councils, should they fold their arms and allow the sharing to continue by the state governors.\n\n10 On Assets Recovery, the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has assisted anti-corruption agencies in devising clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been fraudulently acquired from state coffers before prosecuting suspected culprits. Part of this work has involved painstakingly reviewing existing Laws (Money Laundering Act, 2004, EFCC Act, 2004 and ICPC Act, 2000) to identify and highlight sections directly conferring powers of forfeiture on Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies.\n\nThis advocacy has led to a significant increase in the use of Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture Mechanisms by anti-corruption agencies.\n\n11. To check terrorism financing in Nigeria, the Federal Government has deployed a plethora of tools, including the Money Laundering Act, 2004, the EFCC Act, 2004, the ICPC Act, 2000, Department of State. Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to deal with the issue of corruption, money laundering and terror financing. The ongoing harmonization of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) with National Identification Numbers (NIN) is also a means of tracking the flow of funds within Nigeria and, by extension, tackling terror financing.\n\n12. Let me now highlight the much more-visible activities of some of the various anti-corruption agencies, all of which have been effectively carrying out their mandates. In 2021 alone, the EFCC secured a total of 2,220 convictions. That represents a 127 percent increase in the number of convictions (976) recorded in 2020, and a far cry from the 195 convictions secured in 2016, the 189 in 2017, the 312 convictions in 2018, and the 1,280 recorded in 2019. The 2021 figure of 2,220 convictions represents a 98.49 per cent success rate, with only 34 cases (representing 1.51 per cent) discharged. On Monetary recoveries, in 2021 alone, the EFCC recovered a total monetary amount of N152,088,698,751.64; 1,182,519.75 Pounds Sterling, 50 Emirati Dirham, 1,723,310 Saudi Riyal, 1,900 South African Rand; US$386,220,202.85; 156,246.76 Euros; 1,400 Canadian Dollars;\n\n5.36957319 Bitcoin and 0.09012 Ethereum. The last two are digital currencies.\n\n13. The ICPC has played a pivotal role in bringing about structural changes in the operations of the government, especially regarding improvements in MDAs budget utilization, better value for money, improved project completion, service delivery and higher level of anti-corruption awareness. Recall, gentlemen, that the Commission established the Constituency and Executive Projects Tracking Initiative in 2019 to ensure value for money for the Nigerian people and full execution of projects. Between 2019 and 2021, ICPC traced\n\n2,000 projects worth over N300 billion. During the same period, 326 contractors of abandoned projects across the six geo-political zones were forced by the Commission to return to site to complete projects worth N32.183 billion. Also, the ICPC\u2019s Assets Tracing, Recovery and Management (ATRM) project led to the recovery of cash totalling N34.346 billion and US$1.62 million between 2019 and 2021. Also, the Commission\u2019s System Study and Review of personnel and capital votes of MDAs resulted in savings of N261 billion to the government between 2019 and 2021. ICPC has also secured 66 convictions from the 243 cases it filed in court during the same three-year period.\n\n14. For its part, the analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria, 424 associates/supporters of the financiers, involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change, in addition to identifying 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and 7 co-conspirators. The analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets. Also, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.43 in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.82 in Withholding\n\nTax due to the Government. NFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery. On terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries. During the same period, 2020-2021, the organization returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims who came into the country.\n\n15. There is also the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), which was established as an institutional response to the observed deterioration in the conduct of Public Officers, especially because these behavioural changes manifested greatly in the abuse of public office for private gains. The Bureau handles, among others, issues of asset declaration by Public Officials as well as the verification of their assets. In 2021, CCB issued 125,000 Assets Declaration Forms, out of which 97,201 forms were returned. These figures represent a 48% increase in the number of Assets Declaration forms issued and an 81% increase in submission compliance, when compared with the previous year. As part of its reforms, the CCB is ready to deploy an Online Assets Declaration Portal that will allow for enhanced storage and retrieval of data, reduce delays caused by incomplete and incorrect declarations and reduced errors, among others. In 2021, the Bureau investigated several cases involving illicit enrichment, conflicts of interest, abuse of office and ethical breaches, resulting in the filing of over 200 cases before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\n\n16. Gentlemen, we have gone to this length to let you know that the Buhari Administration\u2019s fight against corruption is unwavering and on course. This Administration has put in place structures that will not only check corrupt tendencies but will also make corruption unattractive and costly to those who may want to engage in it. Even the World Bank says when approaching anti-corruption at the country level, it is important to put in place \u201dinstitutional systems and incentives to prevent corruption from occurring in the first place\u201d, and that is exactly what we are doing with the structural and governance reforms that I have enumerated above. I want to most sincerely commend the efforts of the various anti-corruption agencies for their unwavering commitment to the fight against corruption. I also want to implore all Nigerians to join in this fight, as it is not a fight for the government alone.\n\nWith the support of all citizens, I can assure you that we will defeat this monster that stunts development and impedes investment.\n\n17. I thank you all for your kind attention.",

          "text": "U.S. special forces carried out what the Pentagon said was a successful, large-scale counterterrorism raid in northwestern Syria early Thursday. First responders at the scene reported 13 people had been killed, including six children and four women.\n\nThe operation, which residents say lasted about two hours, jolted the sleepy village of Atmeh near the Turkish border \u2014 an area dotted with camps for internally displaced people from Syria\u2019s civil war. The target of the raid was not immediately clear.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a brief statement that the mission was a success. \u201cThere were no U.S. casualties. More information will be provided as it becomes available.\u201d\n\nSeveral residents told The Associated Press they saw body parts scattered near the site of the raid, a house in Syria\u2019s rebel-held Idlib province. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, and said the raid involved helicopters, explosions and machine-gun fire.\n\nIt was the largest raid in the province since the 2019 U.S. assault targeting the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Idlib is is broadly controlled by Turkey-backed fighters, but is also an Al-Qaida stronghold and home to several of its top operatives. Other militants have also found refuge in the region.\n\nReports on the number of dead varied. A journalist on assignment for the AP saw body parts around the house, whose upper story was almost completely leveled leaving rubble in the surrounding olive grove.\n\nBlood could be seen on the walls and floor of the remaining structure, which contained a wrecked bedroom with a child\u2019s wooden crib on the floor. On one damaged wall, a blue plastic swing for children was still hanging. The kitchen was blackened with fire damage.\n\nThe opposition-run Syrian Civil Defense, first responders also known as the White Helmets, said 13 people were killed in shelling and clashes that ensued after U.S. the commando raid. They included six children and four women, it said.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said the strike killed nine people, including two children and a woman. Ahmad Rahhal, a citizen journalist who visited the site, reported seeing 12 bodies.\n\nThe Pentagon provided no details on who was the target of the raid, or if any combatants or civilians on the ground were killed or injured.\n\nResidents and activists described witnessing a large ground assault, with U.S. forces using loudspeakers urging women and children to leave the area.\n\nThere was at least one major explosion. A U.S. official said that one of the helicopters in the raid suffered a mechanical problem and had to be blown up on the ground. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the military operation.\n\nThe Observatory said troops for the U.S.-led coalition using helicopters landed in the area and attacked a house. It said the force clashed with fighters on the ground. Taher al-Omar, an Idlib-based activist, also said he witnessed clashes between fighters and the U.S. force.\n\nThe military operation got attention on social media, with tweets from the region describing helicopters firing around the building near Atmeh. Flight-tracking data also suggested that multiple drones were circling the city of Sarmada and the village of Salwah, just north of the raid\u2019s location.\n\nThe clandestine operation came as the Islamic State group was reasserting itself, carrying out some of its biggest attacks since it was defeated in 2019. In recent weeks and months, the group has launched a series of operations in the region, including a 10-day assault late last month to seize a prison in northeastern Syria.\n\nA U.S.-backed Kurdish-led force said more than 120 of their fighters and prison workers died in the effort to thwart the IS plot, whose goal appeared to free senior IS operatives from the prison. The prison houses at least 3,000 Islamic State group detainees.\n\nThe attempted prison break was the biggest military operation by the extremist group since IS was defeated and members scattered to havens in 2019. The U.S.-led coalition carried out airstrikes and deployed American personnel in Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the prison area to help the Kurdish forces.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, an SDF senior official Nowruz Ahmad said the prison assault was part of a broader plot that IS had been preparing for a long time, including attacks on other neighborhoods in Hassakeh, Shaddada and areas of Deir el-Zour in eastern Syria and on the al-Hol camp in the south, which houses thousands of families of IS members.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has targeted high-profile militants on several occasions in recent years, aiming to disrupt what U.S. officials say is a secretive cell known as the Khorasan group that is planning external attacks. A U.S. airstrike killed al-Qaida\u2019s second in command, former bin Laden aide Abu al-Kheir al-Masri, in Syria earlier this year.",
