          "text": "Olouwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nPersons living with albinism in Nigeria have always had to contend with some health-related challenges due to the genetic condition they have. But, their toughest challenge is often not the health issues they have to deal with but the different forms of social discrimination and stigmatisation from a section of the population. Donald Tampi and Lawrence Mary, two persons living with albinism, in this report, share their experiences of battling against discrimination, stereotypes and psychological issues. OLUWATOBILOBA JAIYEOLA reports:\n\nDonald Tampi, 32, didn\u2019t always carry the consciousness of his albinism around. His twin brother looked like just him, with skin that didn\u2019t like the sun and eyes that saw men as trees from distances.\n\nHe was a regular kid who played, ran, and laughed like others until he clocked 10 years of age.\n\nFrom that age, he started experiencing the unusual stares from his primary school classmates, the jokes that ended with how his skin looked, and the subtle name callings.\n\nHe then realised that the body he inhabited had become target practice for mockery.\n\nFor him, primary school was a shower of ridicule, while secondary school was the downpour.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn secondary school, I was discriminated against by my peers. It was not funny at all\u201d\n\nHe said that his classmates would sometimes pretend to be blind when they walked past him and taunt him with piercing laughter from a distance.\n\nHe recalled that he sunk into himself, noting that his face was a blank piece of paper every school day.\n\n\u201cThey made fun of me because of my vision/eyes. I always had to move closer to the board, people laughed at me and talked bad about me, and they never said anything good about me.\n\n\u201cThis discrimination made me feel very bad. They usually don\u2019t mock me to my face but at my back. They used to say I could not see,\u201d Tampi said.\n\nAccording to experts, albinism is a genetic disorder that causes a decrease in the production of a pigment called melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes, resulting in light colour or no colour.\n\nPossible eye conditions linked to albinism include poor eyesight \u2013 either short-sightedness or long-sightedness, and low vision, experts say.\n\nSharing the story of his school days with PUNCH HealthWise, Tampi noted that the immense loneliness he experienced affected his performance in school.\n\nHe stated that with the Nigerian schooling system not designed for people with differences, persons with albinism are often at a disadvantage in schools.\n\nHe said, \u201cI felt very terrible. I was being neglected and discriminated against by my peers and I felt different as I didn\u2019t look like others which made going to school tough.\n\n\u201cI always move to the front and sit on the floor to write but when the time is up, I have to stop even when I have not finished.\n\n\u201cMost of the time when I try to borrow notes in primary school, no one would be willing to give them, so it affected my academic performance, I performed low.\n\n\u201cHowever, in secondary school, I somehow managed myself and tried my best to perform well. I realised I had to get on with my life even when the system is against me.\n\n\u201cThis, however, affected me psychologically because I always felt very lonely.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I felt we were all humans created by God and didn\u2019t deserve to be discriminated against. So, I used to wonder why people are doing it.\n\n\u201cBut, now that I am grown, I don\u2019t feel that way anymore. Also, I have learnt a lot from the Albino foundation, especially how to deal with those social discriminations.\n\n\u201cThe Foundation has helped me and changed my perspective towards life.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report released by the Albino Foundation of Nigeria, the majority of persons with albinism in the country suffer a high level of discrimination.\n\nThe report noted that while relatively few cases of attacks against persons with albinism have been reported, a study in 2014 disclosed that 41 per cent of persons with albinism had mental health issues.\n\nAlso sharing her experience with our correspondent, Lawrence Mary, now 30, recalled that she became aware of her albinism while she was in primary school due to her experience in class and how she was treated.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt was when I was in primary school that I got to understand that I was different from other people.\n\n\u201cI noticed in class that I couldn\u2019t see from far whenever I sat at the back. Then, I was so little and shy to even voice out my problems. It was affecting my performance in school, yet I had no one to talk to.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell anyone how I was feeling so the teachers at a point had to call my elder sister to come to the office and informed her that they want to see my parents, but I noticed that my dad knew everything about it, so he was the one that came down to the school and told them to be writing boldly on the board. I then changed my sitting position to the front.\u201d\n\nShe said things became easier for her in class afterward, adding that her academics improved.\n\nShe said, \u201cI remember that every term. I came first in class because everything was easier for me. After all, I could see clearly.\n\n\u201cWhen I was not seeing clearly instead of me to even voice out, I would not voice out, I would just sit where I am and I will just be writing nonsense.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Albino Foundation of Nigeria, only about 12 attacks against people with albinism have been reported in the nation. Yet, bullying and name-calling are common for children with albinism.\n\nMary said, \u201cI mostly felt stigma in secondary school. This was regarding the issue of my eyes and not being able to see clearly. They normally call me oyinbo pepper.\n\n\u201cBut in my class, my friends were people that lived around my area so they know how my parents and family treat me so they made it easy for me and there was no bullying.\n\n\u201cAlthough I had issues borrowing notes from some people as I cannot really write fast, and even if I\u2019m sitting in front of the board I\u2019m not able to write fast, and sometimes I won\u2019t even see the board even at the front because the writing will be too tiny so I have to borrow note.\n\n\u201cWhile wanting to borrow notes, some people will mock me while some others would not even give me their notes.\n\nI used to have a friend then that help me to copy the notes. I was glad for his help.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cMy younger sister is also living with albinism and my mum\u2019s cousins have albinism. My parents stood for me, and they made me have high self-esteem right from childhood.\n\n\u201cMy mum would always tell me that there is no difference between me and them anytime she hears someone trying to mock me.\n\n\u201cI remember there was one of my neighbours, the lady was talking to me and she started shouting at me that why am I looking at her that way and accused me of eyeing her, so my mum came out and spoke to the lady that no, you don\u2019t talk to her that way because that\u2019s how her eyes are.\u201d\n\nMary said was not psychologically affected by stigma because of the kind of family members and close network she had.\n\nPersons living with albinism may suffer psychologically due to stigma\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a Lagos-based Psychotherapist, Dedoyin Ajayi, said she has had to treat persons with albinism in her practice who were psychologically affected by stigma.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have treated a very considerable number. Sometimes I would have a person living with albinism as a patient maybe once in six months and that\u2019s a very considerable number to have consistently. So it is an issue\u201d\n\nAjayi stated that persons with albinism are susceptible to different forms of mental health issues and relational challenges.\n\nShe said this ranges from being socially sequestered to having high levels of low self-esteem, to coming down with depression due to the inherent feeling of inadequacy.\n\n\u201cThis is because persons with albinism tend to feel like they\u2019re not enough. They sometimes also have to contend with anxiety and sometimes, even paranoia,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nAjayi said, \u201cMental health issues are anything that disrupts the functional processing of the mind or the emotion.\n\n\u201cPersons will albinism has lots of relational challenges such as people not seeing them beyond their skin colour. Sometimes they may have people around them like friends and family who are ashamed of them, siblings cropping their picture away because they\u2019re too white, or them having issues with their partners.\n\n\u201cSo most times, they have to work extra hard to impress people. Many persons will albinism even sometimes feel the responsibility to start activism and yet some of them don\u2019t even believe in the activism but get into it to show that they are confident in their skin.\n\n\u201cThis can get pretty overwhelming for them, having to live a life that constantly reminds them of their skin colour,\u201d she said.\n\nNeed for change on albinism\n\nAjayi, an expert in emotional health has urged every member of society to be more humane in their relations with persons with albinism.\n\nShe said when relating with albinos, people should stop making conversations regarding their skin colour because it can be mentally exhausting for them.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to albinism, people have to be more sensitive and humane. Our people have to understand the fact that humans are humans regardless of what their body looks like. It is not good to treat people differently because they are short, tall, or the particular body composition they have is not what yours look like.\n\n\u201cPersons with albinism don\u2019t have melanin and that does not make them less human. When you see them, don\u2019t focus conversations around their skin except they bring it up themselves because it is pretty much mentally draining for them to keep answering the same questions over and over again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t date them out of pity and don\u2019t be their friend out of pretence.\n\n\u201cLove them for who they are and get to know them on a deeper level than just their skin condition and if you cannot deal with how they look, do not go near them. It is not good to pretend you care when you do not. Just be human around them the way you\u2019re human around other people,\u201d the psychotherapist stressed.\n\nAlso speaking on discrimination against persons with albinism, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Albino Foundation, Mr. Jake Epelle said, \u201cI have been screaming to high heavens about the fact that even within the person with disability community; they are discriminating against persons with albinism.\n\nMr. Epelle said that in Enugu State when elections are being conducted for persons with disability, there were moves to sideline persons with albinism.\n\nHe said, \u201cNow it is obvious, it is coming plainly, not all but some disgruntled members of the disability community are just running an ungodly campaign that we are not part of the disability community.\u201d\n\nReporting cases of discrimination against persons with albinism\n\nAccording to Mr. Epelle, the national commission for persons with disability has secured a designated line for reporting cases of stigmatisation. The dedicated line, he said, was approved by the inspector general of police.\n\n\u201cNow every police headquarters in the states have a desk officer designated for persons with disability. That is a good development,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Epelle stated further, \u201cWe also have a copy of the albinism handbook that trains our coordinators on the three p\u2019s which are human rights promotion, protection, and prosecution.\u201d\n\nHow the foundation is fighting stigma\n\nThe Albino Foundation president said, \u201cTaking into consideration the huge number of persons with albinism, I won\u2019t claim that we have done much because there is a whole lot to be done.\n\n\u201cBut one thing nobody can take from us is the fact that we have brought the issue of albinism to the front burner. We have thrown more light on the advocacy component.\n\n\u201cToday everyone knows a bit of albinism and its challenges. we have developed a policy for albinism and the whole world knows that there is a national policy for albinism in Nigeria. We are the first in the world to do a policy.\n\n\u201cA lot more has to be done and it would be done by me and other younger ones that would take over from me.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "*Says: We\u2019ll invite anti-graft agencies for probe\n\nBy Ishola Balogun, Saudi Arabia\n\nThe National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has declared that it will thoroughly investigate the extortion of some Nigerian intending pilgrims by some licenced tour operators who allegedly collected extra money from the intending pilgrims claiming that such amount was requested by NAHCON for their prompt airlifting.\n\nReacting to a viral video where the allegation was made by an intending pilgrim, NAHCON Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, denied requesting or collecting money from any pilgrim.\n\nHe added the issue would be investigated and probably handed over to the anti-graft agencies.\n\n\u201cWell, we need to investigate it (allegation). But if it is true that there were such allegations, there will certainly be sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe will invite the security and investigative agencies, certainly we will,\u201d Hassan said.\n\n\u201cNational Hajj Commission does not collect money from single individual. Even in the state, we also don\u2019t collect money.\n\n\u201cWhen we return home, we will thoroughly investigate this. I make bold to say that the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria collects no single money from any individuals for the matter of operation whether in the states or tour operators. That will be the responsibility of their managers,\u201d he said.\n\nHassan said despite this, the commission made efforts to ensure that all registered pilgrims were brought to Saudi Arabia \u201csince every pilgrim is our own\u201d.\n\nWhile regretting that some intending pilgrims could not be airlifted to Saudi Arabia to perform this year\u2019s Hajj, the NAHCON CEO said the commission tried its best to ensure all registered pilgrims were airlifted but despite its frantic efforts, it was not possible to do so.\n\nAccording to him, the commission had an understanding with Saudi airline, FlyNas for a rescue operation but by the time a two-day extension was granted to Nigeria to airlift all pilgrims, it was too late as the airline had disbanded its crew.\n\n\u201cWe actually had the understanding of FlyNas to do the rescue. But immediately after the gate was formally closed, FlyNas sent their crew back to their different countries.\n\n\u201cSo when we told them that our efforts (to get extra two days), they said they have disbanded their crew and they were from different countries and there was no way in that short time.\u201d\n\nHassan, however, assured those who missed the 2022 Hajj of NAHCON\u2019s readiness to refund their fares immediately, saying that those who do not wish to collect their money back will be given priority next year.\n\n\u201cFor all those who couldn\u2019t come, doe us it was painful and we have made up our mind that we will look for these people and ensure that they get their money immediately we arrive home.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we are ready to refund the money before we get home. In the event that they don\u2019t want to collect their money; this is something we have seen occurring in Hajj, we will give them a priority,\u201d the NAHCON chairman assured.\n\nAbout 1,809 intending pilgrims missed the Hajj exercise.\n\nThe details include: 700 pilgrims from Kano State. 97 pilgrims from Plateau State, 12 pilgrims from Bauchi State and 1000 from Tour Operators.",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has accused a former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode of plotting to create rivalry and disaffection among agencies of government who have been collaborating against the insecurity bedeviling the nation.\n\nIt said the former Minister\u2019s wild and unsubstantiated allegations against the Armed Forces following the Kuje Prison invasion is deliberate falsehood intended to mislead the public.\n\nAlso a pro-democracy group the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) cautioned Fani-Kayode against \u2018unguarded\u2019 utterances that could escalate the security challenges in the country.\n\nThe DHQ in a statement signed by Major General Jimmy Akpor, Director Defence Information, said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to a video produced by Mr Femi Fani-Kayode, wherein he made wild and unsubstantiated allegations against the Armed Forces of Nigeria, regarding the recent spate of terrorist attacks particularly, the attack of the prison in Kuje \u2013 Abuja on 5 July 2022.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily the video and its maker would have been ignored, considering the antecedents of the person behind it as a known Rabble-Rouser. However, in the interest of members of the public who might be misled by the deliberate falsehood and the sensibilities of service personnel and their families who have been paying dearly to keep Nigerians safe, it has become urgent to respond to the video currently circulating in the social media\u201d.\n\nIt continued: \u201cAmong other allegations, Mr Femi Fani-Kayode claimed that the Department of State Security (DSS) informed the military about the impending attack on Kuje Custodial Centre and even the previous attack on the Kaduna \u2013 Abuja rail service. He also claimed that soldiers were withdrawn shortly before the prison attack. In all these allegations, Mr Kayode is merely playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cHe is not in any position to know whether the DSS notified the military of any attack or not. It may not be impossible that such a claim is part of a calculated attempt to cause division and rivalry amongst all Government Agencies that have been working collaboratively in addressing issues of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe claim that soldiers were withdrawn from the Kuje Correctional Custodial Centre before the attack is laughable. It is sad that Mr Kayode is ignorant of whose responsibility it to guard prison.\n\n\u201cMr Femi Kayode further claimed that the military took no action on the recent Shiroro terrorists\u2019 attack, which resulted in the unfortunate death of some soldiers, some policemen and members of the public. This is also an attempt to smear the military and create bad blood between service personnel and the military high command.\n\n\u201cA despicable statement that dishonors the sacrifices of the gallant officers and soldiers that paid the supreme price whilst responding in defence of the civilians and the mining community. What a shame! Mr Kayode is encouraged to pay more attention to the weekly briefs by Defence Media Operations. Defence Media Operations gives weekly briefs/updates on operations being conducted across the country; press releases on military operations are also made when the need arises.\n\n\u201cMr Fani-Kayode is also called to refresh himself on the constitutional roles of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. In all, subordination to civil authority, is key. It is pertinent to state that, the Nigerian Armed Forces has toiled to sustain and nurture our democracy, hence the same military cannot contemplate a coup de tat, as alluded to by Mr Kayode in his video.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Lucky Irabor has always stressed the unalloyed loyalty of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the President, Commander-in-Chief and the Nigerian Constitution. Accordingly, as the 2023 General Elections approach, desperate persons must depart from their evil ways, for never again would they lure the military into their wicked machinations. If a confession must be made, Nigerians must know now: the military is always the worse victim of military rule.\n\n\u201cFinally, in a miserable attempt to malign the leadership of the military, Mr Kayode gave the impression that, while junior military commanders and non-commissioned officers are working hard, senior commanders are doing nothing. This is sheer ignorance and nothing more. Mr Kayode is completely oblivious of the fact that in the military, orders, instructions and directives are issued from the hierarchy to the lower rungs of command. Therefore, junior commanders cannot be working hard while their superiors are idle.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a difficult time for the Armed Forces of Nigeria and Nigerians as a whole. It is not time for attention-seeking individuals to cause needless distractions. Members of the public are therefore urged to ignore Mr Femi Fani-Kayode and continue to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities promptly to law enforcement agencies\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDA in a statement signed by NDA\u2019s Secretary, Biodun Olajumoke, argued that rather than proffer solution to the security challenges, the video by Fani-Kayode \u201csmacks of deliberate efforts to cause more confusion and heighten tension in the polity\u201d\n\nIt read, \u201cFFK and his likes who are in the habit of jumping from one party to the other are indeed the real culprits that want to truncate our nascent democracy.\n\n\u201cIs FFK not aware that political tension is one of the causes of the security challenges? Instead of staying in one place and stabilize the nation they change party like wrapper causing political tension in the country and later come to blame the military.\n\n\u201cWhat are his motives of trying to instigate our young soldiers & junior officers against the leadership of the AFN?\n\n\u201cMaybe they are angry that the Armed Forces has continued to remain loyal to the Constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe, NDA, urge FFK and his group to proffer genuine solutions to the crisis. Our military, both the young soldiers, junior officers and the senior officers have been victims of the security challenges. What we need now is to support them defeat the enemies of the country and not castigate or instigate them against each other\u201d.",

          "title": "Over 800 million faced acute hunger in 2021 \u2014 Report The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The number of people affected by hunger globally rose to as many as 828 million in 2021, according to the latest State of Food Security and Nutrition report.\n\nThis is an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic according to a United Nations report that provides fresh evidence that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030.\n\nThe 2022 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report presents updates on the food security and nutrition situation around the world, including the latest estimates of the cost and affordability of a healthy diet. The report also looks at ways in which governments can repurpose their current support to agriculture to reduce the cost of healthy diets, mindful of the limited public resources available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe report was jointly published today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAs many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 \u2013 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.\n\nAfter remaining relatively unchanged since 2015, the proportion of people affected by hunger jumped in 2020 and continued to rise in 2021, to 9.8 percent of the world population. This compares with 8 percent in 2019 and 9.3 percent in 2020.\n\nAround 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3 percent) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 \u2013 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7 percent of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.\n\nThe gender gap in food insecurity continued to rise in 2021 \u2013 31.9 percent of women in the world were moderately or severely food insecure, compared to 27.6 percent of men \u2013 a gap of more than 4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nAlmost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet in 2020, up 112 million from 2019, reflecting the effects of inflation in consumer food prices stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.\n\nAn estimated 45 million children under the age of five were suffering from wasting, the deadliest form of malnutrition, which increases children\u2019s risk of death by up to 12 times. Furthermore, 149 million children under the age of five had stunted growth and development due to a chronic lack of essential nutrients in their diets, while 39 million were overweight.\n\nProgress is being made on exclusive breastfeeding, with nearly 44 percent of infants under six months of age being exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020. This is still short of the 50 percent target by 2030. Of great concern, two in three children are not fed the minimum diverse diet they need to grow and develop to their full potential.\n\nLooking forward, projections are that nearly 670 million people (8 percent of the world population) will still be facing hunger in 2030 \u2013 even if a global economic recovery is taken into consideration. This is a similar number to 2015, when the goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition by the end of this decade was launched under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs this report is being published, the ongoing war in Ukraine, involving two of the biggest global producers of staple cereals, oilseeds and fertilizer, is disrupting international supply chains and pushing up the prices of grain, fertilizer, energy, as well as ready-to-use therapeutic food for children with severe malnutrition. This comes as supply chains are already being adversely affected by increasingly frequent extreme climate events, especially in low-income countries, and has potentially sobering implications for global food security and nutrition.\n\nThe report notes as striking that worldwide support for the food and agricultural sector averaged almost USD 630 billion a year between 2013 and 2018. The lion share of it goes to individual farmers, through trade and market policies and fiscal subsidies. However, not only is much of this support market-distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers, hurts the environment and does not promote the production of nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet. That\u2019s in part because subsidies often target the production of staple foods, dairy and other animal source foods, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice, sugar and meats of various types are most incentivised food items worldwide, while fruits and vegetables are relatively less supported, particularly in some low-income countries.\n\nWith the threats of a global recession looming, and the implications this has on public revenues and expenditures, a way to support economic recovery involves the repurposing of food and agricultural support to target nutritious foods where per capita consumption does not yet match the recommended levels for healthy diets.\n\nThe evidence suggests that if governments repurpose the resources they are using to incentivize the production, supply and consumption of nutritious foods, they will contribute to making healthy diets less costly, more affordable and equitably for all.\n\nAccording to the FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, \u201cLow-income countries, where agriculture is key to the economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, have little public resources to repurpose. FAO is committed to continue working together with these countries to explore opportunities for increasing the provision of public services for all actors across agrifood systems.\u201d",

Stephen Esumobi who made this known in a press conference in Jos noted that the action became necessary in view of the connection between drugs and insecurity.\n\nAccording to Esumobi,, \u201cThe national enforcement team of the PCN has been in Plateau since the beginning of the week on enforcement exercise and at the end of it, a total of 641 premises comprising 208 pharmacies and 433 patent medicine shops were visited.\n\n\u201cA total of 433 made up of 115 pharmacies and 319 patent medicine shops were sealed for various offences some of which include operating without registration with the PCN, failure to renew premises licence, dispensing ethical products including substance abuse.\n\n\u201cTwo vendors were arrested for breaking PCN seals.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cUncontrolled access to the substance of abuse has contributed in no small ways to the security challenges across the country. This is because most criminal elements in society take this drug as a confidence booster before carrying out their activities.\n\nThe council observed that many wholesale pharmacies and patent medicine shops are not licensed by PCN and have been operating illegally.\n\nIn an effort to address these challenges, the PCN has strengthened the Pharmaceutical Inspection Committee and Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendor\u2019s Licence Committee nationwide to enhance inspection and monitoring activities.\n\n\u201cAlso enforcement activities have been stepped up to ensure that all unregistered premises are closed down.\n\nThese unregistered promises have become channels for the illegal distribution and sale of substances of abuse to members of the public including those with criminal intentions.\n\nHe lamented that the primary goal of these illegal premises is profit and they do not have regard for the safety of the public who patronize them.",

          "text": "Almost all the 36 states of the federation appear overwhelmed by the mounting backlog of pensions and gratuities owed retired civil servants, investigation shows.\n\nThe dwindling revenue from crude oil sales is not helping matters and is even beginning to threaten salary payment in some states.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has not been making remittances to the Federation Account since the beginning of this year on account of the huge cost of petrol subsidy which has gone up from N443 billion to N4 trillion.\n\nThe situation leaves the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to shoulder the bulk of remittances to the federal till.\n\nThe Abia State Government alone is owing its retired workers 20 years gratuities and 38 months pension, while Ogun State owes about nine years gratuities and pension deductions spanning over 21 months.\n\nBenue, Plateau, Taraba, Anambra, Lagos, Kwara, Ekiti and Adamawa are also owing huge amounts of gratuities.\n\nThe last time the Plateau State Government paid gratuity, according to the chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, Comrade Eugine Manji, is 2011.\n\nCivil servants in the state told The Nation that the Simon Lalong administration used to be prompt in paying salaries but the situation has since changed.\n\nManji said: \u201cThe state government paid us salaries last in April, now we are in July. That means three months of unpaid salaries.\n\n\u201cThe same thing is affecting payment of pension. The last pension paid was also in April. As for gratuity, that one is dated back to 2011. Gratuity has not been paid in the state since 2011.\u201d\n\nCivil servants in the state told The Nation that the Simon Lalong administration used to be prompt in paying salaries but the situation has since changed.\n\nManji said: \u201cThe state government paid us salaries last in April, now we are in July. That means three months of unpaid salaries.\n\n\u201cThe same thing is affecting payment of pension. The last pension paid was also in April. As for gratuity, that one is dated back to 2011. Gratuity has not been paid in the state since 2011.\u201d\n\nA state civil servant who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cSome workers are still expecting their April salary. And we are told that June allocation will be used to pay the outstanding April salary, after which the balance will be used to pay May salary in some ministries.\u201d\n\nAbia varsity, poly lecturers owed for 10, 30 months\n\nApart from the 20 year gratuities and 38 month pensions owed by the Abia State Government, it has also not paid lecturers in the Abia State University (ABSU) for 10 months and those in the State Polytechnic for 30 months.\n\nThe story is not different in other tertiary institutions like Abia State College of Education Technical, Arochukwu and Abia State College of Health Technology, Aba.\n\nInformation Commissioner, Eze Chikamnayo, speaking on the situation said: \u201cAbia State is part of Nigeria and as such, whatever affects the national economy will affect the state.\n\n\u201cBut Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, in various ingenious ways has been able to take some measures that have enabled Abia to continue to survive and strive irrespective of the dwindling national allocation.\n\n\u201cUnder Governor Ikpeazu, the IGR (internally generated revenue) has risen by almost100 per cent. In 2015, the state\u2019s IGR was between N450m and N500m. But now, the IGR is well above N1bn monthly.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the fact that a lot of leakages that hitherto existed have been blocked and the regime of collection of government taxes has been computerised, thereby reducing incidence of double taxation and pilfering.\n\n\u201cBut then, because of the downturn in the economy, as we speak, the IGR is also being affected because the capacity of the citizens to earn money and pay taxes has equally been affected.\n\n\u201cSo, as we speak, the state\u2019s IGR has reduced from N1bn.\n\n\u201cDespite the drop in our IGR, Abia State Government is not owing salaries to ministries, departments and agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue of pension and gratuity is a challenge that predates Governor Okezie Ikpeazu\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cCertain reasons are responsible for that, including high incidence of ghost workers which has bedeviled successive administrations in the state.\n\n\u201cSome unscrupulous civil servants padded in a very unconscionable manner the size of the workforce while they were still in office. That led to unrealistic pension figures.\n\n\u201cBut what this administration has done is to carry out biometric exercise to get the accurate number of pensioners. We discovered that excess of over N5 million was being siphoned from the state coffers annually in the name of pension.\n\n\u201cWe have now rounded off the verification and we have started paying the actual pensioners while still working on the figures within the period of over bloated figures.\n\n\u201cAll genuine pensioners are receiving the current pension while we are calculating and paying off the arrears. It will be done on installment basis.\u201d\n\nHe said the federal allocation to the state has dropped considerably from between N3bn and N5bn in the last seven years to about N2.5bn, which he said is not enough to pay the wage bills.\n\nOgun yet to refund deductions\n\nThe Ogun State Government has not fulfilled its promise to offset the pension deductions spanning over 21 months as well as eight years accumulated statutory leave allowances.\n\nThe government\u2019s action was partly responsible for the recent strike embarked upon by civil servants in the state.\n\nThe workers under the aegis of the leadership of the organised labour, which comprises the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Joint Negotiating Committee (JNC), had embarked on a strike action and demanded immediate payment of their unremitted deductions.\n\nPensioners in the state are also unhappy that the government is dragging its feet in paying their entitlements several years after leaving service.\n\nN30bn entitlements: Taraba pensioners threaten 2023 polls boycott\n\nPensioners in Taraba State are threatening to boycott next year\u2019s elections in the state except government settles their pensions and gratuities put at N30 billion.\n\nOnly last Friday, the pensioners stormed the Government House in Jalingo and the State House of Assembly, protesting what they called government\u2019s insensitivity to their plight.\n\nChairman of the State Chapter of Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), Comrade Kefas Katan, who led the protest, said: \u201cSince Governor Ishaku has refused to pay us our entitlements, we have resolved to appeal to God to ensure that the governor and those advising him not to pay us our entitlements should see hell in their future endeavours.\u201d\n\nNon-payment of gratuities will soon be history in Anambra, says commissioner\n\nThe Anambra State Government acknowledges that it is owing gratuities, but it promised that the situation will soon be history.\n\nInformation and Enlightenment Commissioner, Chief Paul Nwosu, told The Nation yesterday that the gratuity was inherited from the past administration.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Prof Chukwuma Soludo administration is doing everything possible in making sure that the gratuities owed to workers are liquidated.\n\n\u201cA lot of things have been put in place to make sure that the gratuities are paid very soon. It is not the fault of Soludo. Rather, it was inherited from the immediate past administration.\u201d\n\nAlthough Nwosu said he had no records of the total amount of gratuities owed by the state government, the state Chapter of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) last February put the figure at over N14 billion.\n\nYobe has culture of regular payment of salary, gratuities, says HOS\n\nThe Head of Service for Yobe State Government, Alhaji Garba Bilal, said government earmarks at least N100 million monthly to meet its pension and gratuity obligations.\n\nIt also does not default in paying salary promptly, he told The Nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo demonstrate the seriousness of the state government on the welfare of retirees and pensioners, the state earmarks the sum of N100 million every month for the payment of pension and gratuities to all workers that left the service on retirement and their pension comes in regularly.\u201d\n\nHe said Government has set up a standing committee that makes quick verification of retired civil servants to avoid delay in the payment of their pension and gratuities upon retirement.\n\nEbonyi: We\u2019re settling gratuities as funds become available\n\nThe Ebonyi State Government says it is up to date in the payment of pensions and salaries but admits that payment of gratuities is dependent on availability of funds.\n\nInformation Commissioner Uchenna Orji told The Nation in Abakaliki that previous administrations in the state defaulted in paying gratuities but Governor Dave Umahi has been offsetting the gratuities as funds become available.\n\n\u201cGovernor David Umahi sees it as sacrosanct that workers salary must be paid between 15th and 20th of every month unfailingly,\u201d he said, adding that pension payment is given equal attention.\n\nLagos Pays N40.5 billion to 10,862 retirees in three years\n\nThe Lagos State Government says it has paid over N40.5 billion to 10,862 retirees since the inception of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration in 2019.\n\nThe retirees are in the Mainstream, Local Government, the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) and other parastatals of the state government.\n\nThe Director-General of the State Pension Commission (LASPEC), Mr Babalola Obilana, said at the 95th Batch Retirement Benefit Bond Certificates Presentation for retirees of the State Public Service in Lagos that government has consistently prioritised pension contributions in the annual state budget.\n\nObilana added: \u201cWe are happy to note that Lagos State is fully compliant with the statutory requirements of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) since its inception.\n\n\u201cDespite various economic and financial challenges, employee and employer contributions are remitted promptly into individual employees\u2019 Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) monthly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, he described Lagos state as a high flyer, having received several awards for exceptional performance in the payment of retirement obligations.\n\nFigures obtained from the Federal Ministry of Finance show that the following amounts were disbursed to states from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) over the last one year:\n\nMay 2022: N241.824b\n\nApril 2022: N201.256b\n\nMarch 2022: N227.201b\n\nFebruary 2022: N190.007b\n\nJanuary 2022: N179.251b\n\nDecember 2021: N221.190b\n\nNovember 2021: N210.046b\n\nOctober 2021: N209.838b\n\nSeptember 2021: N220.272b\n\nAugust 2021: N217.183b\n\nJuly 2021: N222.514b\n\nJune 2021: N215.572b\n\nMay 2021: N194.195b\n\nApril 2021: N193.432b\n\nMarch 2021: N179.242b\n\nFebruary 2021: N166.08b\n\nJanuary 2021: NN177.171b\n\nStory By\n\nNduka Chiejina, Abuja/Kolade Adeyemi, Jos/Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta/\n\nSunny Nwankwo, Umuahia/Nwanosike Oku, Awka/Onimisi Alao, Yola/\n\nDamian Duruiheoma, Enugu/Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan /\n\nJoel Duku,Damaturu/Ogochukwu Anioke,Abakaliki",

          "title": "Untold story of Kuje prison attack \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Molly Kilete, Jude Idu, Abuja\n\nThe first, second and third bomb explosions from the Boko Haram terrorists last Tuesday night may have caught the residents of Kuje Area Council napping.\n\nConsequently, many of them were thrown into panic and confusion. But the successful attack on the Kuje Medium Correctional Centre did not certainly come as a surprise to visitors, workers and close residents of the facility.\n\nFully armed to the teeth, the daredevil Boko Haram insurgents numbering over 300 came fully prepared with bombs, grenades, and all manner of high-calibre ammunition just on a single mission to free their commanders and other members held in the detention facility.\n\nThe seamless manner, the clinical execution and insignificant casualties recorded on their part were confirmations that they took their time to perfect and execute the operations with faultless intelligence.\n\nIt was not an operation carried out in a haste, as available information revealed that they inhabited freely with the residents, and rented houses near the prison facility, for several months or even up to a year.\n\nAs part of their efforts to perfect their planned operation, many of them were said to have disguised themselves, operating as commercial motorcyclists, private security men, traders, and labourers, among other menial jobs, that facilitated their easy blend, especially in the Mosques, markets, and homes with other innocent residents of Kuje.\n\nWhile the plot lasted, they did not leave any trace that could give them away apart from their excessive consumption of Indian hemp, occasional display of aggression and periodic strategic meetings.\n\nHowever, as they carry on their clandestine activities, intelligence reports were either weak, not acted upon or totally ignored. The synergy among the security agencies continued to widen to the point that a security report confirming the attack, on the eve, was deliberately or casually overlooked.\n\nExploiting the weak intelligence, the insurgents had continued to get emboldened by the day, including smoking weeds very close to the back of the prison wall unchallenged and mingling with the security guards during prayers, until the intimidating gang, numbering over 300, successfully carried out the operation with expectedly feeble resistance from the security forces, who may be relatively very new to their duty post.\n\nWith the operation successfully carried out in a show of superior force and celebrated in carnival-like mood with soft drinks littering everywhere, human and material loses of an unimaginable magnitude were incurred.\n\nIn counting the losses, the prison wall had fallen, inmates, numbering over 1,000 escaped, sensitive and non-sensitive documents were either burnt or carted away and more importantly, the insurgent commanders were freed from captivity to worsen and escalate the war against the enemies of the country.\n\nBut, in reality, activities at the Kuje Medium Correctional Centre, to close residents, regular visitors, staff and even the security guards, rightly depict the explosion of the time bomb that has been building up to go off at the planned time.\n\nApparently, security lapses were evidenced in many ways. There was no regular power supply to light up inside and outside the facility.\n\nAccording to a Correctional Service staff, the challenging power situation was so bad that inmates had to resort to the use of rechargeable lanterns for light.\n\n\u201cBeyond overpopulating the prison by majorly awaiting trial inmates without conscious efforts to decongest the population, the absence of any Close-Circuit Cameras to monitor activities within and outside the prison yard was another challenge of serious concern. There was no perimeter fencing to ward off intruders, which aided the attackers to easily seize the centre,\u201d the staff lamented.\n\nThe source added: \u201cFor those that care to know, Kuje Medium Prison is one of the freest facilities in the world. It is so because there has always been an influx of international human rights organisations into the prison. With that development, there is a limit to which the prison authorities can deny the inmates exercise of some fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, that might have accounted for the reason many high profile inmates were allowed the use of phones. Let me shock you that there is one particular Boko Haram commander inside the prison that knows about virtually all the attacks they want to carry out in any part of the country, even as an inmate. He looks so intimidating with the heavy muscles he had continued to build inside the prison.\n\n\u201cThe porosity of the prison accounted for why the authorities rejected the appeal to bring Nnamdi Kanu back to the prison again when he was rearrested. I can tell you that the prison cannot avoid experiencing the horrible incidences it had when Kanu was there before.\n\n\u201cThe inmates were sharply divided along ethnic lines. The atmosphere was always charged because the inmates pledged their loyalties to their ethnic leaders like Kanu and the Boko Haram commanders. I cannot forget in a hurry the day deadly clash was averted inside the prison.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that the loyalists to the Boko Haram leaders were tired of the harassment from those loyal to Kanu that always want to clear the road. Unfortunately for Kanu loyalists, they tried it when the Boko Haram commanders who were outside, but they refused to leave the road.\n\n\u201cThey threatened to burn down the prison and kill Kanu. The warders on duty begged both sides, but none was ready to bulge. Those in-charge were involved and it took more than 30 minutes to restore calm. After the incident, the prison had peace of the graveyard until Kanu finally left. It was that ugly experience that made the authorities resist any plan to bring Kanu back to this centre.\u201d\n\nHow the terrorists struck\n\nLike the divergent views in the description of an elephant, different accounts have trailed the modus operandi the insurgents adopted in attacking the Correctional Centre with the popular account being that they struck through the back gaining confirmation from the authorities.\n\nSome of those whose houses are few metres away from the prison confirmed to our correspondents that the attackers came from the riverside behind the prison; while others claimed they attacked from the front.\n\nHowever, a prison staff, in an official account argued that they deployed a three-pronged attack.\n\nIt was further gathered that the terrorists had gathered, in clusters in surrounding villages, on the eve of the attack to perfect their movement on D-day.\n\nThough the villagers in the communities raised the alarm over the presence of strange persons in their vicinity, to the police and security agencies, not much was done to curtail the movement of these strangers until the attack on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you for sure is that they knew that if they had escaped through the road, they would have been intercepted by the security forces. The truth is that they were more proactive to choose and study an escape route through the bush path. They came through there and left through the same route. It was a bush path they have used severally without sending a negative signal to the villagers on what their real mission was,\u201d the prison officer told Sunday Sun.\n\nPorosity\n\nSecurity sources described the location of the Kuje prison as very porous and prone to attacks by anybody.\n\n\u201cAs a prison where hardened criminals are kept, not much was done to secure the place from attacks. Even the walls are made of blocks instead of casting.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the facility does not have a buffer and a second wall as part of security measures to make it difficult for criminals to gain access. At the back of the prison is a vast expanse of land that is not properly monitored, which made it very easy for the attackers to gain access into the building.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists had planted four explosives at different spots around the prison that went off one after the other. With the blasts that sent a warning signal and scared the security guards, they were able to go in with other dangerous weapons to free their colleagues and escaped without much resistance from the soldiers who had just been rotated a few hours before the attack.\n\n\u201cWhile the attack was going on, the soldiers, about 33, in number could not do much to return fire for fire using their AK47 riffles, while the terrorists came prepared with General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG), and other sophisticated weapons.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers who had barely accustomed themselves with the vicinity of the prison were so confused that they forgot that they had an Armour Personnel Carrier (APC), mounted in front of the prison. However, two of the terrorists were killed by the soldiers who also went after the terrorists in the bush. Their decision to raid the forests in the FCT, yielded positive results as some escapees were rearrested and returned to the facility.\n\n\u201cAlthough security operatives comprising the military, police, DSS, and the paramilitary agencies were drafted to the scene of the attack Tuesday night, a detachment of helicopters from the Nigerian Air Force, began patrolling the airspace Wednesday morning,\u201d a top security source told Sunday Sun.\n\nIn another account, some security personnel always on duty at the Kuje prison for some time now, described the location of the facility as very dangerous and prone to attacks.\n\nHe said that apart from residents encroaching dangerously close to the facility, the Medium Correctional Centre is surrounded by bushes that stretched to Shiroro in Niger State and other dangerous locations housing bandits, terrorists and criminal groups.\n\nThe source, who does not want to be mentioned in print, said that the facility is not fit to detain rapists and pickpockets let alone hardened criminals like terrorists, bandits and their likes.\n\nWhile emphasising that the facility is poorly built, our source said that the government were not proactive in upgrading the facility to accommodate the criminals.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the prison walls that ordinarily should be done with cast and a buffer were not considered by those who built the place knowing full well that it is a prison facility.\n\n\u201cRather than spending money to upgrade the facility to a string and lasting wall for protection from attacks, the contractors under the supervision of government, used blocks like every other house owner to build the walls, which made it very easy for the attack to blow off the fence,\u201d our source explained.\n\nSecurity collaboration conspiracy theory\n\nRegardless of how they carried out the successful operation, the suspicion of the involvement of security agents has understandably persisted.\n\nA prison officer, in attesting to it, confided in our correspondent that despite the Armour Personnel Carrier (APC), and submachine gun at the disposal of the security agents on guard, there was no single attempt to deploy the weapon to use.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists that came for the operation did not touch the APC and the submachine guns, yet they burnt down the official and personal cars beside them. There was no single resistance from the security forces on ground to confront the attackers.\n\n\u201cDespite the numbers of the combined security guards, comprising the army, police, Civil Defence and our own armed squad, none of them was courageous enough to curtail the terrorists. In fact, the Civil Defence personnel who lost his life was the only one who tried to display gallantry, but he paid with his life because he could not understand why the army and mobile policemen withdrew, or listened when his colleague warned him to go into hiding. The response rate from the security guards was not encouraging at all.\n\n\u201cInside the prison was completely empty in the morning hours because virtually all the inmates escaped. From what I gathered, one of the terrorists even broke into the office where sensitive files are kept and either destroyed or burnt them not to trace any record about them. I also gathered that they made attempt to break into Abba Kyari\u2019s cell, but it was difficult for him,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut, the Minister of Defence, Bashir Salihi Magashi, while confirming that the terrorists were on a mission to free their commanders mainly Boko Haram members, said that they succeeded in evacuating 64 Boko Haram members inside the detention camp, but however, dismissed the insinuations and conspiracy theory in the involvement of the security agents.\n\n\u201cThe people that came for this operation, from available records are believed to be from a particular group and most likely they are Boko Haram members. This is because we have a sizable number of Boko Haram members in detention at Kuje prison, but presently we could not locate any of them. The number of Boko Haram inmates is about 64 and none of them is in prison again. They have all escaped,\u201d he revealed.\n\nOn why the army responded too late and equally failed to act on the security report, the Defence Minister said: \u201cIf people give timely intelligence at the right time, I am sure we will react promptly. But when it is not coming on time you don\u2019t expect us to react. There is every likelihood that the situation is going to be interpreted on the basis of being quick or slow in responding to intelligence.\n\n\u201cFrom our discussion, I am sure that every security agent that came to Kuje Prison participated in every way possible to ensure that the prisoners did not escape. There was reinforcement because the Brigade of Guards was fully in charge. Our happiness is that many of them have been recaptured.\u201d\n\nMisuse of purpose\n\nThe 33-year-old detention facility, built and commissioned on August 14, 1989 and rated as one of the best in Northern Nigeria with a potential 560 capacity inmates, was meant to keep pro-democracy activist prisoners from the southern part of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, due to the resurgence in crime and criminalities, the prison had deviated from the initial purpose it was meant to serve, and started accommodating hardened criminals, bandits and terrorists.\n\nReacting to the situation in Kuje Prison, Retired Deputy Controller of Prison, Simon Dung, in a chat with our correspondent, lamented that Kuje prison only recently developed a negative reputation as a detention centre for high profile criminals like Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cMay I remind you that Kuje Prison was actually a facility financed by the military to keep pro-democracy agitators? One of the groups involved in the campaign to end military rule in Nigeria was Campaign for Democracy (CD), which is a pro-democracy coalition of human rights, women\u2019s, workers, and student groups. Pro-democracy activists arrested for whatever reason across Nigeria were sent to Kuje prison.\n\n\u201cAt that time, crimes of terrorism of this dangerous sort have not reared their ugly heads. And one couldn\u2019t think of this kind of jailbreak happening during those days. So, part of the reasons for laxity on the side of the government is that most of those who have ruled Nigeria since 1990s are from the military with little or no preparation for occasions of this kind.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is a security tower, built to be manned by a sentry and possibly private soldier in those days while guiding pro-democracy agitators who were mostly academics and women, different cases from the kind of crimes and criminality experienced today.\n\n\u201cI am also aware that there has not been any major renovation or remodelling of the facility to make it sophisticated to stand the 21st Century security challenges.\n\n\u201cSo, as you can see the reason for setting up Kuje Prison was political and not crime. And what would have been of immense priority was to redesign the prison after it started housing high profile criminals like a proscribed terrorist group, Boko Haram,\u201d he noted.\n\nResidents react\n\nFor every resident of Kuje, the unimaginable escape of the terrorists has thrown them into heightened apprehension and confusion.\n\nIt has worsened the already insecure cases of marauding kidnappers and robbers ravaging the area council.\n\n\u201cTo think that we have mingled with members of the deadly Boko Haram sect in our midst for that long is traumatic enough for every resident of Kuje. Come to think of it that they have known the terrain very well having been involved in Okada operation, which took them close to our house even made our situation more terrifying,\u201d a resident, who declined his name for security reasons, lamented.\n\nAnother respondent, a commercial motorcycle operator, who identified himself as Magaji Wahab from Kebbi State, innocently blamed the attack on security lapses.\n\n\u201cYou see, sometimes the military will claim that they know security well. But, I can tell you that most of these boys came in and infiltrated the community months before the operation. As I do this work, I have seen many things, but my own is to collect my small money to feed my family.\n\n\u201cSo, before it happened many of them were operating Okada and that is why on the day of the attack, scores of terrorists stormed the location with motorcycles and detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and grenades.\n\n\u201cLast Tuesday, was the most fearful night of my life because even though we saw some of those boys when they entered the town and could not inform police or army for fear of using me as an example, it was shocking that the security agencies could not curtail the attack.\u201d\n\nMary Simon Bako, a widow, residing right behind the prison facility told Sunday Sun that she and her family witnessed unusual movements from fierce-looking men sitting close to the bush consuming India hemp endlessly.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw them, we felt something unusual, but it did not occur to us that it was going to be this kind of war-like situation. You see, since seeing boys smoking weed in and around Kuje has now become a daily thing, we felt it was as such,\u201d she narrated.\n\nReacting further, Bako described the sounds from the bomb explosives as deafening, adding that the several gunshots during the attack should be enough to kill all the security men around the facility.\n\nThe widow admitted that all have not been the same for her household since the attack, lamenting that the situation has affected her income because security agents now comb her compound every now and then with strict instruction not to either move about at odd hours or stay out beyond 3:00p.m.\n\n\u201cCan anyone tell me how I can cope with this kind of situation? I feed and pay school fees from this business and we stay late into the night while dealing with customers,\u201d she said.\n\nSani Gorah, another resident of Kuje, in a shocking revelation, narrated how he housed military men that took cover in his residence.\n\n\u201cI slept under my bed; the military men on the road entered my house. They dived under my bed and said they were the target. According to them, they have better guns than that of the military which is AK 47,\u201d he said.\n\nSani further explained that bullets nearly hit his brother, Hassan, who was coming home from town.\n\n\u201cThe operation lasted from around 10:00p.m to 12 midnight with no military presence to stop them. I can tell you this because the shooting continued unabated.\n\n\u201cIt was at that point we understood that those boys we saw previously meant bad. I think I have learnt my lessons about this community. Today, I understand that the prison yard is a security threatening environment,\u201d he quipped.",

Precisely, by 12 noon, Saturday, July 16, the curtain will finally draw on the four-year tenure of Governor Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola, leaving the coveted seat up for grabs.\n\nOn that day, the electorate will file out in their numbers to elect the candidate of their choice who would oversee the affairs of the state for the next four years.\n\nAs contained in the final list released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), 15 political parties have indicated interest to participate in the governorship election.\n\nThese include the Accord Party, AAC, ADP, APC, APM, APP, BP, LP, NNPP, NRM, PDP, PRP, SDP, YPP, and ZLP.\n\nA cursory glance at the figure shows that all contending forces are males with six of them having females as running mates, which is a complete negation of the 30 percent affirmative action on women\u2019s participation in politics.\n\nIn line with the INEC regulations, the field is wide open for all political parties to campaign and persuade the electorate for votes. But not all the candidates are taking full advantage of the window of opportunity provided by the electoral umpire.\n\nOut of the 15 listed contenders, only the standard-bearers of the APC, Governor Oyetola, his rivals in the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, former deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Lasun, the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Akinade Ogunbiyi and Accord Party (AP) respectively are visibly showing signs of seriousness in their campaigns. Others have literally consigned themselves to the back seat.\n\nWatching from the sideline, many political pundits see the contest as a straight fight between the APC and PDP.\n\nThis is particularly bearing in mind the crowd being pulled by the two parties in their electioneering as well as their dominance in all the local government areas of the state.\n\nAs Sunday Sun observed, the presence of other political parties has not been so much felt in most parts of the state compared to APC and PDP.\n\nFor the APC, in spite of the obvious advantage of the power of incumbency, Governor Oyetola has been unrelenting in his vigorous campaign for re-election for his second term.\n\nIn the same way, Ademola Adeleke has left no stone unturned in his effort to wrest power from the APC-led government. In one of his campaign tours of the state, he was quoted as saying that the election would be fire-for-fire, which perhaps explains the reason he took the battle to Boripe Local Government, the governor\u2019s country home, with a massive crowd of his supporters.\n\nNonetheless, the political atmosphere in the state has been very peaceful. However, one thing most political analysts have found to be an aberration to the Yoruba culture of respect for traditional rulers is the open partisanship of some Obas. While it is customary for candidates to pay homage to town monarchs before going on an open campaign tour, some notable Obas in the state have misconstrued the gesture to mean an opportunity to showcase their bias or favour for the visiting contenders.\n\nFor instance, Adeleke recently got a shock of his life when his campaign train stormed the palace of the Owa-Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, only for him to be told pointedly that Ijesaland was for the APC.\n\nAn overzealous Adeleke had lamentably poured out his mind about the poor living condition of the people, as well as the deplorable state of the roads within the Senatorial district. \u201cIlesa as a senatorial district ought not to be like this. I want to assure you that when I win come July 16, it will change. When we were coming to the palace and the people thronged out to meet us, we noted that the suffering is too much. The roads in Ilesa are also bad even the road that leads to the palace is in a bad condition. We will do the needful,\u201d he enthusiastically declared.\n\nBut instead of a reciprocal commendation for his show of concern, Oba Aromolaran pointedly turned down the overture, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need money from anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said the other time that the people of Ijesa are suffering, we are hungry truly, but God will continue to feed us. In Ijesa, we are independent of the government; we built the palace ourselves without collecting a dime from outsiders. The current governor wanted to give us money, but we did not collect. The only thing we demanded from the governor was to help us inaugurate it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any money from anybody. We built a hospital for the aged. The appeal I want to make is that when you become the governor, don\u2019t forget us. I am grateful for you visiting us, we are very fine.\u201d\n\nWhile Adeleke and his supporters have had to take the unintended brickbats with a pinch of salt, the outburst of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, who also recently declared that PDP made him the crowned king, has no less elicited negative comments from certain quarters. Some concerned stakeholders in APC see the declaration as an open endorsement of Adeleke as his preferred candidate.\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Akanbi, in his usual eccentricity, took the trend a notch higher by organising a special prayer for Governor Oyetola, pledging to deliver 90,000 votes for the APC in the July 16 poll.\n\nThis is aside from a recent meeting of some traditional rulers held at the palace of Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Agbaje, where the monarchs in attendance unanimously endorsed the candidature of Governor Oyetola, directing the Muslims, Christians, traditionalists, artisans, motorcycle and Okada transporters, students, applicants, civil and public servants, men, and women organizations to support and vote for Oyetola in the coming governorship election.\n\nWith the growing show of partisanship, there is a widespread insinuation that the whole charade must have been masterminded by the Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oyetola\u2019s hometown Oba, who many observers have accused of rallying his colleagues to support his son and also persuading other sons and daughters of the town to vote massively for APC.\n\nOther than the negative consequences the worrisome trend of open politicking by some Obas might likely have on the institution of traditional rulers, electioneering in the state has been quite peaceful and orderly without any incident contrary to the earlier apprehension about the possible outbreak of violence among the supporters of the two leading parties.\n\nAs the campaign is gradually winding to a halt, opinion is divided as to which of the two leading parties-APC and PDP is likely to coast home to victory. On a balance of scale, it might be safe to say that it is too close to call. But some factors are possibly going to work in favour of the APC.\n\nOne, APC as a ruling party has a strong structure across all the local governments in the state. In a circumstance like this, it is much easier for the party to mobilise grassroots support because of patronage of office.\n\nSecondly, the apparent show of solidarity by the Southwest governors elected on the platform of the APC as well as the recent victory of the party in the recent Ekiti State election could be a morale booster for both the electorate and the supporters of Oyetola at large. There is also a high possibility of a bandwagon effect on the voting pattern.\n\nAs already demonstrated by the APC campaign council, both the local and national are united in their efforts to lead the party to victory.\n\nWhile the electioneering lasted, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano states were very much on hand, leading Oyetola to every nook and cranny of the local governments to woo the electorate for votes.\n\nAgain, with the newfound relationship between Governor Oyetola and his predecessor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the coast now appears to be clearer for the party.\n\nAregbesola, who heads the splinter group, \u2018The Osun Progressives (TOP), was said to have reportedly warned his members not to work against the APC. That is already a big plus for Oyetola.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun, the Chairman of Ede North Local Government of the TOP, Oladejo Afeez, who recently joined Oyetola\u2019s faction, said that his decision was informed by the directive given to them by the Minister of Interior who directed them to work for APC. Afeez, while confirming a change of disposition, said: \u201cYes it is true that I have left TOP together with my people in Ede North Local Government. Aregbesola said we should not work against APC and we should not decamp to another party. I will rather stop being in politics than decamp to PDP.\n\n\u201cAll the party executives, including the women leader have followed me to join Oyetola.\n\n\u201cSince our leader has told us not to work against the party, we should stay in the party and work for the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIn the face of all this, no one who has been watching the campaign train of the PDP will undermine the formidable force of Adeleke. With his impressive performance in the last election, he still enjoys a considerable following across the state.\n\nHowever, his main challenge is the internal wrangling within the PDP, as the disaffection arising from the governorship primary still remains largely unsettled. Almost all the founding fathers and chieftains of the party have vowed not to have anything to do with Adeleke.\n\nAdeleke caught the anger of the party stalwarts when his supporters allegedly attacked former Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who was suspected of working for the emergence of Dotun Babayemi as the party\u2019s standard-bearer, warning him to steer clear of the governorship contest.\n\nSince then, Prince Oyinlola, former deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Shuaib Oyedokun, a former member of the Board of Trustees of (BOT), Senator Olu Alabi, and some other party chieftains have distanced themselves from Adeleke and his campaign activities.\n\nAlso, another co-contestant in the 2018 governorship election, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, has left the PDP to pick the governorship ticket of the Accord Party (AP).\n\nPolitical observers have described the gale of defections that recently hit the PDP in the state as a big minus for Adeleke. Those who defected to APC include the running mate of Senator Adeleke in the 2018 governorship election, Albert Adeogun, and the factional chairman of PDP, Hon Wale Ojo, among others.\n\nIt is not exactly clear where a factional governorship candidate of the PDP, Dotun Babayemi, currently stands in the present scenario.\n\nWhile, on one hand, he has been calling for support for the PDP, on the other hand, he has been found to be conspicuously missing in Adeleke\u2019s campaign rallies.\n\nWhen contacted, the Director of Media, Omooba Dotun Babayemi Campaign Organisation, Kayode Oladeji, said \u201cHe (Babayemi) is campaigning for the party because it is the logo of the party that is written on the ballot and not the name of the party candidate.\u201d\n\nThough APC has equally recorded some harvest of losses in recent times, including a former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Kolapo Alimi, political watchers say the figure could not be compared with the defectors to the APC.\n\nThis, they say, calls for concern for the PDP and its candidate. While nursing the wounds, the Senator representing Osun East, Senator Francis Fadahunsi, who has been a strong member of PDP in the state, is equally said to be having a face-off with the Adeleke family over an alleged plot to deny him the return ticket in the just concluded primary. It is on account of this, Sunday Sun gathered, that Fadahunsi has dissociated himself from Adeleke and consequently refused to partake in all the campaign activities of the PDP.\n\nThese are bound to have some negative impacts on the success chance of the PDP in the coming election except there is a quick resolution of the lingering crises ahead of Saturday\u2019s poll.\n\nRegardless of the changing dynamics of the power game, optimism is high that the INEC would conduct a free, fair, and credible election devoid of violence as recently experienced in the Ekiti State governorship election held last month.",

          "text": "Oluchi Chibuzor\n\nA coalition of Civic Society Organisations has challenged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to proactively curtail technical manipulation activities in order to curb vote buying in the forthcoming governorship election in Osun State.\n\nThe coalition lamented unprecedented vote buying that characterised the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State, pointing out that the 2023 general elections could be exposed to dangers of massive rigging.\n\nThis was contained in a joint statement by Chairman, National Consultative Front (NCF),Prof Pat Utomi; Convener, Civil Society Committee for Anti-Fraud Election Security (CISCAES), Mr. Kennedy Iyere and Coordinator, Peace Action Transformation, Mr. Adegboyega Adeniji yesterday.\n\nThe statement said the coalition was largely on ground \u201cto monitor and to observe the Ekiti elections.

          "text": "Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe governorship hopeful of Delta State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. David Edevbie yesterday said his decision to challenge the outcome of the party\u2019s gubernatorial primary election was based on his desire to save the party from being overrun by any opposition party in the state in the light of the gloom the outcome had cast.\n\nHe asserted that the opposition would have taken advantage of the situation had he not gone to court to correct the glaring anomaly while appealing to those who left the PDP to return.\n\nHe said that he was initially reluctant to seek legal redress in which he got Thursday\u2019s victory at the Federal High Court in Abuja, saying he was dedicating the victory to the entire people of the state and to democracy.\n\nIn apparent reference to the legal battle issuing from the party primary in May, the former finance commissioner said that at no time since joining the governorship race did he tell himself the road would be easy, saying he was however positive and confidence about ultimate victory.\n\nEdevbie revealed that though he was reluctant to challenge the outcome of the party primary in court, he knew he had to do it in order to clear the shadow of gloom which his supposed loss to Sheriff Oborevwori had cast over the whole state.\n\nWhile thanking Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and party leaders as well as other PDP members and campaign organisation, he said that he could not wisely claim the high court victory for himself alone.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, this should not be seen as a personal victory but as a victory for our great party, PDP, which is firmly rooted in justice. It is also a victory for democracy and therefore, it is now time to put our differences aside and work together as a family to ensure our success at the next general election\u201d, Edevbie said.\n\nHe appealed especially to PDP members to put behind them the friction created by the travesty of the outcome of the gubernatorial primary election and to rally round his candidature towards an unbroken chain of PDP victories in the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed and made available to THISDAY yesterday, Edevbie said: \u201cYou may recall that at the beginning of my consultations, I said that the journey to transform Delta into a modernised state would be challenging. From the very start, I also envisaged that there would be setbacks and false starts, but regardless, I proceeded with my usual verve.\n\n\u201cTo lead the transformation of a state as vast and diverse as Delta to its destiny, in terms of growth and development, requires a strong sense of purpose, faith, and the courage to keep leading even in moments of seeming disappointment.\n\n\u201cClearly, it is not a task for the faint-hearted or pusillanimous. Fortunately, the required qualities and abilities are what I was primed for from the outset of my working career, both in the private and public sectors in Nigeria and abroad and the allure of a new lease of life, growth and happiness in Delta State provided the impetus.\n\n\u201cDelta State has always been a PDP State and by the grace of God, it will remain so after the next elections. We must work together on the shared vision and goal of modernisation even as we embrace all those who either contested with us or supported other contestants. This is their victory too.\n\n\u201cNow that order has been restored, our PDP family is stronger and ready to defeat all opposition parties in Delta State in 2023.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I implore all our brothers and sisters, who became disillusioned and left PDP recently, to return to the fold. This is not the hill to die on.\u201d\n\nIn the Thursday\u2019s court ruling, the presiding Judge, Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo, declared that Sheriff Oborevwori is not qualified to contest for the office of Governor of Delta State, adding that the applicant/plaintiff, Edevbie should be given due respect as the PDP Delta State governorship candidate.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the provision of S 84(3) of Electoral Act, the court held that the plaintiff (David Edevbie) is the valid Governorship Candidate of the PDP in Delta State and should be accorded the maximum respect\u201d, Justice Taiwo ruled.\n\nOborevwori, the defendant who is also Speaker, Delta State House of Assembly, has since indicated his readiness to appeal the verdict of the high court.",

My message to Nigeria is about peace. As long as we have peace, our country will prosper and progress. We should all work for peace always. That is my Eid message,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Eid prayer was led by the Chief Imam of Ilorin Sheikh Muhammad Bashir Soliu, who thereafter slaughtered ram, which symbolised the height of the Eid rites.\n\nAlso, at the Eid was the Emir of Ilorin, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, accompanied by a retinue of royal chiefs and kakaki-blaring traditional guards",

          "title": "INSIGHT: How dissemination of fake images is aggravating Nigeria's security challenges",
          "text": "Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, is currently plagued with serious security threats \u2014 from banditry to insurgency. As a result, Nigerians have been through a roller coaster of emotions, ranging from anguish to hopelessness. So, when fake photos surface online showing vivid scenes of killings, kidnappings and arson from different parts of the country, they go viral and generate a lot of comments, conspiracies and controversies.\n\nThese images mislead people and have also become an avenue to stir up and intensify social conflict. They inflame hate speech, extremism and ethnoreligious tensions. In some cases, they even provoke violence and protests, further destabilising the country\u2019s fragile peace.\n\nHOW FAKE PHOTOS GO VIRAL\n\nSeeing is believing, they say. According to a researcher from the Australian National University (ANU), people are more likely to believe a false claim if it is presented alongside a photo. The research further stated that when combined with text, photos add authenticity and emotion. Such photos may have been taken out of context or digitally altered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, a Facebook page \u2014 Biafra Today News \u2014 posted a picture showing Micheal Collins Ajereh, a Nigerian music producer better known as Don Jazzy, in a Biafra-themed outfit.\n\nBiafra is a Nigerian separatist movement associated with Igbo nationalism, which supports the recreation of an independent state. The post, which garnered over 15,000 reactions, created the impression that Don Jazzy had publicly identified with Biafra.\n\n\u201cWe are good to go, God bless Biafra,\u201d Chinonye Ibe, a Facebook user, posted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon jazzy king, Biafra must be restored,\u201d Gift Okechukwu Uwadiegwu, another user, commented.\n\nHowever, a forensic analysis of the photo showed that it was photoshopped and the music producer had posted the original picture on his Instagram page.\n\nThe same Facebook page also posted an image of a burning building in Cameroon in 2018, claiming that the picture actually depicted the Nigerian military bombing and secretly killing Biafra agitators in Akwa Ibom state. Most of the commenters were angry; some were shocked while others expressed animosity towards the armed forces.\n\nIn February, a post was circulated on Facebook warning of an imminent attack on Obigbo youths in the south-south by the military. The post was attributed to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a proscribed separatist group in Nigeria. A picture of a sleeping man in military camouflage was also attached to the post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a quick verification through reverse image search showed that the picture was first posted online in 2016 in a report by People&Power, showing a fighter of the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group.\n\nAlso, in March, gunmen launched a deadly attack on a train in the Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna state. The gunmen were said to have blown up the rail track after which they launched an attack on the passengers. Several people were killed, scores sustained gunshot injuries, while others were reported missing.\n\nFollowing the incident, an image began to circulate online which showed how two trains collided and sparked an explosion.\n\nSocial media users, who posted the image, attributed it to the Kaduna train attack without stating if the image was for mere illustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was also rehashed in some media reports, using the same unverified image to illustrate the Kaduna train attack. A fact-check done by TheCable traced the source of the real image to a train collision in the northern province of Semnan, Iran, on November 25, 2016.\n\nTherein lies the danger of posting or reposting information online without verifying them. Even if you retract that tweet or online post, the message has already been viewed by thousands if not millions of people. Opinions would also have been shaped, and may potentially result in violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNIGERIANS SHARE THEIR TAKE ON IMPLICATIONS OF FAKE NEWS ON NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nWe went to the streets of Lagos to ask Nigerians what fake news means to them, if they had ever fallen victim to fake news, as well as its impact on society. Interviewees were also shown two images \u2013 a real one and the other fake. They were asked to spot the fake photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of the respondents were able to spot the fake one. The responses also showed that many Nigerians regard fake news as one of the biggest contributors to national insecurity.\n\nHOW TO CURB SPREAD OF FAKE IMAGES\n\nSpeaking on the dangers of false information, Kemi Busari, editor of Dubawa, a Nigerian fact-checking platform, cited an incident where a photo circulated on Facebook alongside a false claim intensified ethnic tensions and caused multiple deaths in Plateau state.\n\nIn this case, a graphic image of a mutilated baby, killed in Congo Brazzaville in 2012, was shared with the claim that the act was perpetrated by the Fulanis against the Beroms in Jos, in June 2018.\n\nAccording to media reports, Berom youths took to the streets and sought out Fulani men for reprisal attacks.\n\nThis, in turn, spurred more attacks and many lives were lost.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s to show how false photos could cause grave harm to any society,\u201d he said.\n\nBusari emphasised the importance of fact-checking in reducing the spread of false information.\n\n\u201cFact-checking is very important in curbing this, especially when we think about the present security situation of the country. We have security challenges, ethnic issues and elections are coming,\u201d he explained.\n\nBusari also advised journalists to critically analyse the images that accompany their news articles.\n\n\u201cThere are cases where the image used for a story portrays something entirely different from its content. Pictures speak louder than words. We should take note of that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should also try to fact-check any image that we come across, especially on social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), there is a need to create awareness about fact-checking tools such as TinEye and Wayback Machine so that the average person can use them to verify the authenticity of images.\n\n\u201dGovernment response is often too slow. That is another challenge. There is a need for capacity-building programmes for law enforcement agencies to immediately identify fake pictures and respond to them before it reaches so many people. They need to be trained for this,\u201d Hassan added.\n\nAs the 2023 Nigerian general elections draw closer, fake news, propaganda and disinformation are expected to be on the rise. Everyone has a responsibility to combat this scourge. Think twice before you retweet that image or share that content.\n\nThis article was produced with mentorship from the African Academy for Open Source Investigations (AAOSI), to tackle disinformation that undermines our democracies, as part of an initiative by the International Centre for Journalists (ICFJ) and Code for Africa (CfA).

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today on Everyday People, we meet Rita Anwiri Chindah, an intellectual property and information technology lawyer and an arbitrator based in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State. A random decision at the university led her down a path that would eventually turn her into an educationist. Now she hosts the IPSERIES podcast, a mini blog series on Twitter, and publishes a Substack newsletter to educate people on how much intellectual property is a part of all we do.\n\nI published my first [IPSERIES] episode on May 18, 2020. I think I had about 65 plays in how many days, but the feedback I kept getting from people was that I was sniffing and truthfully I was sniffing because I have allergies.\n\nI started getting comments from people on how to record. Someone suggested I should record in a quiet place. So sometimes when I want to record, I have to tell my family, cause I stay with my parents.\n\nI tell them, \u201cI\u2019m recording today. Please, can you guys, you know, tone down the noise,\u201d and they do that.\n\nThen someone else suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a mic?\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to get a mic?\u201d I tried to get one from Jumia, and when they did not deliver after one month, they said I should go to the nearest post office.\n\nI went there the first time and they said, \u201cOkay, maybe come back next week.\u201d\n\nAnd I went back the following week.\n\nThey said, \u201cAh, Madam, we never receive anything [we haven\u2019t received anything].\u201d\n\nI was like, \u201cAh!\u201d\n\nSo I think I sent an email or I called. And they said if I couldn\u2019t wait, I should cancel the order.\n\nI was like, \u201cAfter waiting this long, are you people joking?\u201d I had had enough. Like, seriously, why are we not moving forward? Why do we always look for ways to frustrate people?\n\nThen this year, I think I saw someone on Instagram selling a mic, and I was like, \u201cOkay, let me try her,\u201d and I bought it, and it was excellent.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nRita Anwiri speaking at a South South Media event. Source: Instagram\n\nI did my LLB at Madonna University, Okija, and in 400 level, they introduced three elective courses: oil and gas, banking and finance, and intellectual property (IP). And I was like, \u201cWhat is intellectual property?\u201d\n\nI just decided to do the random one I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nIP education for me started when I was at Infusion Lawyers. Senator Ihenyen, my boss at the time, and I had this conversation about IP awareness and educating people. And then, the firm came up with a Frequently Asked Question blog called IP ABC.\n\nThat was where the interest started to build up. Then I started dropping IP bits on Twitter and tagged it IPSERIES. I\u2019m not sure if that was the first major case I analysed. It wasn\u2019t much of a case, but I saw someone post something that I felt was untrue because Deola Sage put up a notification saying her Komole design had been registered as a design under the Nigerian Design Act.\n\nSomeone said she didn\u2019t have the right to do that, \u201cHow can you protect aso oke [traditional Yoruba fabric]?\u201d\n\nI thought about it and concluded it was not ordinary aso oke. So I sat down and compared the original Yoruba aso oke and Deola Sage\u2019s Komole [Kandids].\n\nI went on Instagram and I stumbled on this post and it makes me very excited because creatives such as Deola has taken a bold step in the fashion industry to protect her designs.\n\nNow the not clearly states that any infringement of any sort would be prosecuted \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/qdshVQz92w \u2014 ANWIRI (@esmeraldo99) October 23, 2019\n\nI did that tweet, and people received it well, so I started building on that.\n\nThen during the pandemic, LolA With The Duffle Bag on Twitter shared a link to her podcast and said that she uses Anchor to do her recording.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for my new podcast where I\u2019d be sharing and answering your questions. Watch, listen and enjoy!\n\n\n\nFirst episode drops May 4, links would be available then. Get ready to subscribe on Spotify, Apple podcast, google podcast and other platforms.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udca1 and \ud83d\udcbc pic.twitter.com/covcNVmnrh \u2014 LolA With The Duffle Bag\u2026 (@L3galtool) April 27, 2020\n\nSo I checked it out, and when I realised it was very easy to record and share, I decided to try doing a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast, I began considering a newsletter. Telema Davis, one of my friends who always pushes me to do more, told me to do it if I wanted to. Expectedly, he edited my first newsletter publication.\n\nI didn\u2019t know which platform to publish on, and he suggested Substack? So I got my Substack account. So far, I have 66 or 67 podcast episodes, 12 newsletters, and over one hundred mini blog series on Twitter.\n\nSomeone who has listened to all my podcasts suggested I put my microphone in a pillowcase and, you know, talk into it, and the background sound would be muffled.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done all those things just to make sure that I put out good quality content.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not easy staying consistent; it\u2019s a bit overwhelming because each content must have a different storyline. So it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just copying, pasting, and resharing.\n\nContent is key, and everything is content. When you\u2019re just starting, you don\u2019t get likes or retweets, and at such times, you wonder if you\u2019re making sense. But once you keep at it, people get to know and interact with you.\n\nWalking through the process\n\nRita Anwiri (third from the left) speaking at a panel at the Africa NXT 2022 event\n\nFirst up for me is usually the research, where I have to study the case and look out for things people didn\u2019t notice while reading or talking about the case because I\u2019m giving a Nigerian/African perspective. So I also have to read and compare many documents and conversations.\n\nThe next step is structure. How do you want the story to flow? Are you going to tell a very witty story? I write and then type because I\u2019m used to capturing my thought processes on paper first. As I type, I figure out what is relevant and what to discard.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done with research and typing for the Twitter series, I start posting. Sometimes I try to throw in pictures to help people better understand the conversation.\n\nWhen that is done, I share the link on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSometimes, depending on how complex it is, I decide to have a guest on my podcast. I remember we had this Tracy Chapman and Nicki Minaj case when I started, and I was wondering how to discuss it. So I reached out to Mark Jaffe, a colleague and friend who is more into copyrights. Interestingly, this connection was not physical, and that is the beauty of the Intenet \u2014 it is easy to connect with people.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that foreigners always want to help, so I was not surprised when he asked what I needed. We had a very interesting conversation and he said he was willing to come back and talk about something else if I needed him to.\n\nDealing with Internet connection issues\n\nRita was selected as a Trailblazer by the World Intellectual Property Review (WIPR) magazine in 2020\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, especially with network issues; I once went in and out of a session with a guest ten times.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope the last episode recorded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d I replied\n\nWhen I was listening to the recording, I did not hear anything that I said, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThere was this time when it was a football matter and I wanted to interview two guests, but only one of them could log in. After many attempts, we cancelled and did not try to record afterwards; I felt bad because I was really looking forward to that conversation, which was going to shed light from the eSports sector to the regular sports sector\n\nSo while the Internet is good, the technical issues are not fun. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing sometimes because you\u2019re all hyped up. You have your router or your MiFi on standby. You have your mobile data, just in case. And before you know it, something unexpected happens. I sometimes ask myself why I am in Nigeria.\n\nI was so upset once that I tagged Anchor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this to me, today of all days? I can\u2019t even log in. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies, maybe check your Internet,\u201d they responded.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cOh gosh, the Internet again!\u201d\n\nThe thing is you are trying to task yourself mentally while doing many things simultaneously, but people have no idea what goes into producing content. When you\u2019re Googling and reading different documents, make sure give a brief summary of everything because that is really where the work is.\n\nAnd the thing is, you are trying to tax yourself mentally while doing all of this and people don\u2019t see behind it. When you\u2019re trying to Google, trying to read different documents, make sure that you give a brief summary of everything. That\u2019s where the work is.",

          "title": "Has government lost its monopoly of violence to terrorists?",
          "text": "Like in many areas, Nigeria is powering very low on security. The government has since lost its power to non-state actors, which has turned the country into a huge insecure enclave where lives are lost at ease and with no one asking questions.\n\nThe government appears so impotent that bandits and other assorted brands of criminal gangs now dictate the pace of things.\n\nWhile Boko Haram has asserted itself in many parts of the North East, driving political leaders to tears with their murderous activities, bandits have taken over many parts of the North West, dispensing anguish on daily basis. Moreover, in some parts of the North Central down to South East and South West, Fulani herdsmen kill at will, sacking indigenes from their ancestral homes and terrorising everyone without any challenge from government of the day.\n\nRead also: 2023 polls: We will not tolerate any form of violence, Military warns politicians\n\nNigeria has sunken to the point that criminal gangs abduct innocent citizens at will, and take them into the bush and Nigeria\u2019s combined security forces, including the military are not able to do anything in an age of technology where other countries deploy drones to do a lot of things.\n\nThe other day, on the very nose of government, terrorists took their dastardly act to a notch higher by waylaying the President\u2019s advance security team in Katsina.\n\nLater that same day, another band of the bloody vampires launched a ferocious attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, a stone\u2019s throw to the seat of power in Abuja, deploying bombs, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), and freeing over 600 inmates, including Boko Haram fighters detained at the facility.\n\nIn Nigeria today intelligence gathering by security agencies does not mean anything. They may gather it but they do not use it for anything. Sources said that the security appratchiks were told of the planned attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, nothing was done to nip it in the bud.\n\nNigerians have reached a point where their governor cannot rescue her citizens from terrorists but terrorists can easily and do easily rescue their members from government prisons. As serious irony!\n\nDachung Bagos, deputy chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Anti-Corruption, believes that chunk of the blame for the worsening insecurity in Nigeria should be on the Federal Government.\n\nHe recalled that the House recently organised Security Summit where useful suggestions were made, but the Executive arm headed by President Muhammadu Buhari did not act on those suggestions and recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe have called for the sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA) on the floor of the House, but nothing is happening. Nigerians are disappointed in the executive for not coming hard on the intelligence community. Look at the July 4 shooting in Chicago, the perpetrator has been apprehended and the citizens are sure that justice is going to be served, but here it is about media talk,\u201d he said.\n\nBagos who was worried that government is not doing what it should do even in crisis situation, said: \u201cWe expect that the pictures of the 64 terrorists that escaped should be everywhere now for Nigerians to see. They should have been published, profiled; it is not an issue of restricted information. Their pictures should have been out there so that people will be able to recognise them on the road and alert the necessary agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nCecil Esekhaigbe, a retired major-general, wondered how a huge number of terrorists could beat all the security posts on the road without anybody noticing or challenging them.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThose guarding such facility should be investigated. And we are having conflicting figures of those who escaped and who are still around.\u201d\n\nHe also said that some of the negotiators with the terrorists were said to have passed the intelligence or information that plans were afoot to attack the correctional centre, yet nothing was done about it.\n\nRead also: Violence remains major obstacle to achieving food security\n\nSome years ago when the problem of insecurity was at its infancy stage, Chidi Amuta, a publicist and international journalist, in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay, said that the Nigerian Federal Government may be losing its monopoly of violence and dispensing of brute force to rein in outlaws.\n\nToday, it does seem that government has completely lost that right to bandits and other assorted criminal gangs in the country.\n\nAmuta had said that \u201cThe capacity of the state to guaranteeing security of lives and property is also a function of the state of the economy. It is the duty of the state to buy guns, to maintain a police force, military and all which is superior to those of the ones challenging them. But a situation where non-state actors are now challenging the state, in the area where the state used to have monopoly; then there is problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn those days, if you hear that government is coming, you run away because government has uniform and has big guns. But today, uniforms and guns are no longer a monopoly. In fact, non-state actors- the militants and all the others- have bigger guns. Theirs is even more frightening. Armies and soldiers have a protocol for deployment of forces. Now, a militant or terrorist has no protocol, they have no rule of engagement; in fact, the bigger the gun a person wields, the more the person is a commander. And as a result of that, insecurity which breeds instability becomes the order of the day.\u201d\n\nIn what seemed a shameful acceptance of incompetence and complete disappointment of the masses of this country, the Federal Government Friday admitted that the country\u2019s security operatives could not match the superior firing powers of terrorists that attacked the Kuje Correctional Centre. Kai!\n\nThe Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists had claimed responsibily for the attack on the Correctional Centre, located at Kuje, about 25 minutes drive from the only International Airport that serves as gateway into the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi, while briefing State House journalists on the outcome of the National Security Council meeting presided over by President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, disclosed that \u201cthe security personnel deployed to the facility did their best to repel the attack but were subdued by the superior weaponry of the terrorists.\u201d\n\nAsked why no arrest was made, he said: \u201cSome of them have been killed. But I can\u2019t give you the number and I don\u2019t know the number. Because like they use to do, whenever one of them is killed, they take away and you cannot know the number of people who have been killed. But definitely, quite a number of them were killed and many of them ran away with bullet wounds.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on an exclusive interview with BusinessDay Sunday, Olisa Agbakoba, a SAN, said the attack was shameful.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that at the highest level security is not taken seriously except it is regime protection; because I cannot see how 300 bandits could storm a prison; stayed there for hours and nothing happened and nobody knew.\n\n\u201cSo, that tells you that security is not a high agenda; it is not a high priority in government. Where were the DSS, the entire security apparatus in Nigeria? They all went to sleep and these guys were in the prison for 3 hours?\u201d\n\nAsked what his reaction would be if he were the president, he said: \u201cI would fire all the Service Chiefs, and anyone responsible for internal security from the Minister of Interior to the DSS. Somebody must take responsibility; look at the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson resigning. Someone must bear the consequence for failure.\n\n\u201cI would sack everybody responsible and make it clear that if you don\u2019t do your work, you get the punishment. But in this country where there is no punishment, no sanctions so it is not an issue. Even the Minister was at the Prison; is that what he should be doing? So, when there is no sanction for bad behaviour that\u2019s what you get. I would fire everybody including the prison controller-general. How do you have grasses growing around the entire place; that\u2019s a security threat in a place called medium security prison; and you are going there in your opulence. The proper thing to do is to fire all the people responsible.\u201d",

          "title": "What worsening insecurity means for 2023 election",
          "text": "With the 2023 general election drawing closer, stakeholders have expressed concern about the spate of insecurity across the country and the impact it could have on the smooth conduct of the elections.\n\nThe escalating security situation in Nigeria has affected the conduct of elections in recent years; there have been increased militarisation of the voting environment due to increased violence often perpetrated by supporters of desperate politicians.\n\nIn the last seven years, the spate of insecurity across Nigeria has worsened, the situation is particularly worse in the North-East and North-West, with many lives lost to kidnapping, Boko Haram insurgency and separatist movements.\n\nNigerians are not sure who would be the next victim, while nowhere is safe for now.\n\nJust some days ago, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advance security team was attacked with some officers killed and several vehicles damaged.\n\nIn another of such deadly attacks, Boko Haram terrorists the same day launched a ferocious attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, deploying bombs, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), and freeing no less than 600 inmates, including Boko Haram fighters detained at the facility.\n\nReports said six inmates and one security personnel were killed during the attack.\n\nMinister of Defence, Bashir Magashi (rtd) said of the 994 inmates at the prison, 600 escaped.\n\nThe situation also forced the relocation of other high profile detainees, notably, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, among others.\n\nTerrorists also invaded three communities in Kaduna and killed twenty people, while 25 women were abducted during the attack.\n\nAn eyewitness told newsmen that the bandits numbering about 30 came on motorcycles to carry out the attack on the villages.\n\nAcross Nigeria, attacks and kidnapping for ransom have become daily occurrences in which high profile Nigerians have also been affected.\n\nThe concern for many is that if the bandits and terrorists can attack the Nigerian Defence Academy, invade airport, attack the President\u2019s advance security team, invade prison to release over 1,200 inmates without challenge, amid taking communities hostage and hoisting their flags in some settlements, then there is no safety in the country.\n\nFor many, the present fear for safety, amid the alarming rate of attacks on lives and property across the country pose a big risk for the success of the 2023 general election.\n\nJust like the way a secured and enabling environment boosts investor confidence in a state, the same way a safe domain is key to the turnout of voters, the deployment of ad-hoc staff, including the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members and, to a large extent, the credibility of the poll.\n\nDiscussions about Nigeria\u2019s situation have become rife as elections approach; to elect who Nigerians think will transform and redeem the state from the cliff position.\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) intensifies preparations for next years\u2019 elections, experts say that the situation calls for serious concerns, and that if not checked could undermine the conduct of free and fair elections.\n\nParticular source of concern is the North and South-East, where the terrorists and unknown gunmen are very active.\n\nSimilarly, experts say the worsening spate of insecurity was responsible for the increasing voter apathy in the country, while the situation may continue in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThey noted that increased militarisation of elections in some states in recent years have compounded the situation.\n\nTunde Ajayi, business intelligence expert, lamented that the security situation had aggravated in recent years partly because, security agencies only respond to security threats that affect government officials, political leaders and the elite rather than what affect an average Nigerian.\n\nAjayi predicted that the spate of violence in Nigeria would affect voter turnout in next year\u2019s general elections, if there was no effort to check the trend.\n\nHe added that violence in Nigeria has been democratised, while non-state actors are involved in it, stressing that it is a different situation now compared to 2019.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe high number of Nigerians registering to get their Permanent Voter Card (PVC) would improve voter turnout. Everybody else is less important to the security apparatus, it is focused on the administration in power and the elite,\u201d AJayi said.\n\nIkechukwu Nwanna, president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in Lagos State, said the current trend called for concern ahead of next year\u2019s election that must be urgently checked by the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is a major danger to our general election next year. Our elections in recent years have been marred by violence, but we have not had this level of insecurity before across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe electorate may fear; they don\u2019t want to endanger their lives, and refuse to come out to vote. In some cases it can delay delivery of election materials.\n\n\u201cI call on the security agencies to do their work and stop the current spate of insecurity in Nigeria now.\u201d\n\nChijioke Umelahi, an Abuja-based lawyer, decried that even the president is not safe, for bandits to attack his advance team.\n\n\u201cWe thought that Mr. President is their man. Why are they attacking him indirectly? Imagine if the over 300 bandits that invaded Kuje Prison were unleashed on Election Day, who would step out to vote? We are in a more precarious situation than Ukraine now; it is just that the UN and other international bodies are believing all the lies from the government. The government is involved and can silence the bandits and terrorists if it is serious about it\u201d, he lamented.\n\nSpeaking further, Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, who lost out in the primaries for the House of Representatives seat for the Ohafia/Arochukwu Federal Constituency, said that the 2023 general election would hold but would be marred by more irregularities and voter apathy than before because of the alarming rate of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that the bandits may resort to ballot box snatching at gunpoint for money from politicians, they may also warn communities not to step out to vote, and even blockade security operatives from intervening in their areas of control during election. The defenseless citizens will stay back because the government has disappointed them over the years and the election victory will go to the wrong hands again,\u201d Umelahi disclosed.\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian lecturer and research fellow in Belgium, what the worsening insecurity means for the 2023 general election is fear of attacks or bloodbath for innocent voters that step out to vote.\n\nThe Nigerian in the Diaspora is more aggrieved that many of his countrymen who want to exercise their civic rights would be casualties of the various election violence and senseless attacks by bandits during and after the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cI think the government in power intends to use the insecurity in the country to its advantage on Election Day. What responsible governments all over the world usually do before elections is to ensure that safety of lives and properties of the citizens are secured to enable the voters to come out to exercise their civic duties.\n\n\u201cOf course, the bandits will be at work in 2023, but will want to use their rising negative influence to either obstruct the election or rig in favour of their supporters, which are obviously growing going by the way they are breaking jails and challenging soldiers in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOnikoyi admonished those who say that despite insecurity the 2023 general election will hold to rethink because there have been some unimaginable changes, shifts and moves in recent times.\n\n\u201cWhat if the bandits go suicidal on Election Day, killing any voter they see, what if they decide to bomb INEC offices a week to election to destroy voting materials, what if they go after the candidates, you think they cannot and why not if they can attack Mr. President\u2019s advance team. Things have changed including the hope for peaceful 2023 elections, which may be delayed because of insecurity. Let\u2019s watch, things are already unfolding and the government, which is in recess mode already, will only watch from a distance,\u201d Onikoyi lamented.\n\nIn the same vein, Elvis Omejiaku, a director of strategy at an Abuja-based civil right organisation, decried that what the growing insecurity means for the 2023 general election is inconclusive election.\n\nWhile the parties and politicians are planning with their thugs and security operatives on how to rig the election results in their favour, Omejiaku fears that there may be no voters at most polling units because of the fear of insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe work with global networks and the data and intelligence information for Nigeria on security is not pleasant at all. In 2023, people will give priority to their safety rather than helping a politician to achieve his selfish aims because all those aspiring to be president are all doing so for their selfish interests and not for national good.\n\n\u201cIf all the soldiers and police were sent away before the bandits invaded Kuje Prison, the same will happen in areas that politicians think will give them winning votes, and informed voters will stay away. Voter apathy will rise because of insecurity\u201d, he said.\n\nGenerally, many think the level of insecurity will keep voters in the safety of their homes during the 2023 general elections, while ballot snatching and other irregularities may result in inconclusive elections and possibly rerun of the election.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay Sunday, Adams Aliu, a Benin-based constitutional lawyer, said the prevailing security challenge will not deter eligible voters from exercising their franchise on the day of election because the only way to change the rising insecurity threatening livelihoods across the country is to cast their votes for their preferred candidate.\n\nThe legal practitioner described the menace of kidnapping and other criminal elements as a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d, and urged the electorate to brace up ahead of the election.\n\nAliu pointed out that the constitution provides that security and welfare are the aims of government, and if the government cannot secure the lives of citizens, then they do not have business being in government.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be encouraged to go and vote. Voting is a right, it is not optional. The recent attacks will not prevent people to cast their votes. What we are witnessing now is why Nigerians should use their PVC to change the status quo if they feel it is bad.\n\n\u201cThe current insecurity situation is a challenge on the government to prove that they are not culpable or conspiring because people are trying to insinuate that there are powers behind those kidnapping people or doing all sort of criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThese criminals have attempted to bring security lapses to the homes of government, they should be apprehended, tried and punished accordingly to serve as deterrent to others,\u201d Aliu said.\n\nRead also: Federal Government urged to be proactive in war against insecurity\n\nTimothy Ogbe, a Benin resident, said: \u201cThere are several threats to the electoral processes and insecurity is one of them. Aside vote buying and violence, which has, in the past, characterised Nigeria\u2019s elections, the current insecurity situation, which include but not limited to kidnapping, is affecting everyone.\n\n\u201cToday, Nigerians can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed. Anytime you listen to news, you hardly hear something good these days; it\u2019s either clergymen are kidnapped or bandits attack some persons in certain communities.\n\n\u201cThese things play key roles in voting pattern. You don\u2019t expect people to troop out of their houses or travel interstate when they know danger await them on the road, rail, air or bush paths. We are in a dilemma and something needs to be done before, during and after the election,\u201d Ogbe said.\n\nRead also: What worsening insecurity means for 2023 election\n\nWhy insecurity won\u2019t affect 2023 election \u2013 Agbakoba\n\nBut in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay Sunday, Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said that the insecurity would not affect the election.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has a number of elements. What I have noticed is that regime protection is always uppermost in the scheme of things. When the regime is threatened a security system works. There will be no problem of insecurity because there is regime protection. The state does not spare anything to ensure that its powers are not threatened. Look at Ekiti gubernatorial election, it went calmly. Osun is also going to go calmly. 2023 election will also go calmly,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had last week formally extended indefinitely the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise which was to end on June 30.\n\nMahmood Yakubu, INEC had previously given a hint about the extension at the closing ceremony of the musical concert organised in Abuja to sensitise eligible voters ahead of the general election.\n\nYakubu assured that: \u201cThe voter registration exercise will not end on June 30 as earlier proposed. It will continue till prospective voters register.\u201d\n\nThe Commission made the extension public after its meeting in Abuja through a statement by Festus Okoye, INEC national commissioner and chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee.\n\nAccording to Okoye; \u201cThe Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) will continue nationwide, and all the Resident Electoral Commissioners and Electoral Officers have been directed to continue with the exercise pending further directives from the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has consistently reiterated its resolve to continue to provide electoral services to the Nigerian people and register all eligible Nigerians that are interested in registering. The Commission has yet again deployed additional machines to areas of pressure and will continue to serve the people of Nigeria,\u201d\n\nINEC had on June 28, 2021 flagged off the CVR with the projection of registering about 20 million new voters and having at least 100 million voters for the 2023 general election more the 87 million that participated in the 2019 polls.\n\nRead also: Osun 2022: INEC devolves distribution of PVCs to registration areas at ward levels\n\nYakubu, the INEC chairman had ahead of the commencement of the CVR, said while 14. 2 million voters were registered during the 2017 \u2013 2018 CVR; the commission was projecting to register between 16 and 20 million voters in the 2021-2022 exercise.\n\nThis was reiterated by Okoye in an interview with BusinessDay when he said INEC was targeting a minimum of 20 million additional registrants in the ongoing nationwide CVR exercise to increase the total number of voters to more than 100 million in the country.\n\nHe said the Commission would carry out the physical registration of voters within a period of one year in 2, 673 centres nationwide.\n\n\u201cFor the current exercise, the Commission is targeting at least 20,000,000 new registrants. So many of our young men and women are enthusiastic about our online registration portal and we believe that it will ease congestion in our registration centers,\u201d the INEC chief spokesperson had said.\n\nHowever, as at 7am last Monday, being July 4 which marked quarter four, week 12 of the exercise, fresh registration stood at 10.487 million voters.\n\nClose to the hitherto June 30 deadline, INEC was in the eyes of the storm over glitches in the process of registration precipitated by the surge in the number of prospective registrants who turned up for the exercise.\n\nThe only demand then was extension of the deadline and nothing less coming from critical stakeholders such as civil society organisations (CSO), the electorate and the parliament.\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and some displaced Nigerians had dragged INEC to court to stop it from ending the exercise on June 30.\n\nEqually, the House of Representatives through a motion of urgent public importance moved by Benjamin Kalu (APC Abia) urged INEC to extend the voter registration deadline by an extra 60 (sixty) days from June 30, 2022, to enable Nigerians register.\n\nKalu argued that the decision to suspend the voters\u2019 registration is in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 which requires INEC to suspend voters\u2019 registration at least 60 days before an election.\n\nHe said the House was: \u201cAware that in April 2022, INEC declared that about 42percent of the voter registrations recorded since the commencement of Continuous Voters Registration on 28 June, 2021 were invalid with about 20 million unclaimed Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) Cognizant of the large numbers of unregistered eligible voters willing to be registered as evidenced by crowd seen at various registration centres resulting in congestion.\n\n\u201cConcerned by reports of shortages of voter registration machines, inadequate manpower and personnel at registration centres which may lead to frustrations among prospective registrants and in some cases, unrest at some registration centres.\n\n\u201cAlso aware of calls from concerned Citizens and Civil Societies urging INEC to extend the voters\u2019 registration deadline to accommodate eligible voters desiring to register for their Permanent Voters Cards.\n\n\u201cFurther aware that the right to vote is critically important to the health and legitimacy of our democracy, as well as electoral integrity.\n\n\u201cAlso cognizant that if nothing is done to improve the shortage of voter registration equipment and extend\n\nthe deadline for voters registration, millions of Nigerians will be disenfranchised thus jeopardising the integrity of the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nINEC met with House committee on electoral matters to which the motion was referred accepted to extend the CVR exercise beyond June 30, 2022.\n\nAisha Dukku, chairman of the committee told journalists that the committee held a meeting with INEC during which the commission agreed to extend the timeline, though not up to the 60 days requested.\n\nDukku said: \u201cWe invited INEC Chairman and he came and we presented the request and resolutions of the House and the resolutions are: INEC to extend the registration of all Nigerians of 18 that want to be registered to get their PVCs.\n\n\u201cIn the motion we mentioned for at least two month which is 60 days. The resolutions of the motion were discussed at length and in response, the chairman of INEC saw with the House what is physically happening in our various constituencies. The number of people coming out for registration is unprecedented and we cannot deny Nigerians in wanting to be registered because it is their constitutional right\n\n\u201cIn their response, they were positive because they are also a body in charge of that aspect. The first success is to get Nigerians that are eligible to get their voters card so that they can exercise their right come Election Day.\n\n\u201cHowever that registration of voters is one aspect. There are other milestones that have to be achieved which include the printing and distribution of the voters cards. And the printing of lists of all persons registered in all the 7744 local governments nationwide.\n\n\u201cSo he said it would not be possible for INEC to extend to the days we requested. However they would go back and look at their timelines and look at how best they can to increase the days for registration.\u201d\n\nNow that INEC has bowed to pressure and extended the CVR exercise, the question is who will be the ultimate beneficiaries?\n\nCould it be Nigerians, political parties and their candidates, or is it just for the sake of it? The question became necessary because INEC had earlier said any extension could mean that many prospective voters may not get their PVCs printed.\n\nSome Nigerians are of the opinion that the extension will give them more opportunity to register and vote for candidates of their choice in the 2023 general election.\n\nTo politicians and their candidates, the extension offers them the chance to mobilise prospective voters especially in their strongholds to get enrolled and obtain PVCs to vote for them at the polls.\n\nINEC too, despite its earlier fears, now have the window to work towards meeting their target of registering about 20 million voters and populating the voters\u2019 register with at least 100 million voters.\n\nEzenwa Nwagu, executive director of Partners for Electoral Reforms told BusinessDay Sunday that though the extension was not canvassed by politicians, it will benefit all stakeholders in the electoral process, especially the electorate.\n\nNwagu, however, said the campaign should go beyond registration for PVCs and be about sensitisation of Nigerians to collect the cards and come out to vote for candidates of their choice on the day of election.\n\nHe said: \u201cPoliticians didn\u2019t ask for the extension. It is the civil society organisations and Nigerians who were trooping to registration centres in a fire brigade approach, understanding that as a people we have become last \u2018minuters\u2019.\n\n\u201cVoter registration has been on for nine months in the centres but the places were empty, no registrants came around and when they heard that it was about to be closed they rushed and because of that pressure INEC had to be compelled to extend so that Nigerians who want to register will not claim that they were shut out from registration.\u201d\n\nOn the expected time the exercise should last, the civil society leader said: \u201cThere will be a window at a point up to the 2023 general election when INEC feels that the time to process the voter\u2019s cards is not inhibited in any way, it will have to shutdown.\n\nLike in Osun for instance now, election is next week there is no longer voter\u2019s registration because the fact that if you do voter\u2019s registration now you will not be able to process those cards for election next week.\n\n\u201cThe campaign now is not just about voter\u2019s registration. There are many uncollected cards in INEC offices throughout the country running into millions. People should go and collect those cards and when they collect them, before this registration we have 84 million there are about on the register and we don\u2019t have up to 40 million people voting. The issue is not about going to collect voter\u2019s cards.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons people go to register; some register because it is a means of identification, other people register because in their community they are told that they need to top up their voting strength so that the amenities that will come to their communities will also be huge.\n\n\u201cSo there are various reasons people register but the most important campaign is to go and vote. Even if you add 10 million people today to the register if you still have less people coming out to vote then, all this energy and effort will be in vain.\u201d",

          "text": "The past five years have shown us how fragile democracy can be, not only in Nigeria but around the world. We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

She added that the situation can be salvaged by practitioners through sincere display of integrity and commitment to the practice.\n\nSpeaking Olaosebikan said: \u201cThere is an urgent need for the application of core professional standards of integrity in service delivery and this would undoubtedly make professionals to be more relevant in our ever-dynamic and unpredictable socio-economic environment. Virtues such as trust, honesty, humility and a commitment to transparency should be upheld while transacting business with the clients.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cPractitioners within the space of marketing communications, event planning or management, advertising, public relations, etc. must also be able to constantly network to learn from others, as knowledge is key to success in the profession. Practitioners need to improve on their skills and knowledge through periodic training.\n\n\u201cYou will all agree with me that our personal knowledge is the bedrock of anything we want to achieve in life and we must be intentional about it. The knowledge entails that we must have a deep understanding of the market where we operate because our business thrives and operates in circles, which follow socio-economic and political trends. Practitioners must have a clear understanding of what the client wants. Knowledge of what is available in the market at all times, including the ones handled by colleagues or other participators within our highly competitive space and this is very crucial\u201d.\n\nOlaosebikan also spoke on, \u2018Strategies for timely closure of transactions\u2019, she lamented that all over the world the perception that PR practitioners have trust issue is rampant because some people collect funds from clients and fail to utilize the funds for the purpose meant for.\n\n\u201cAt McEnies Global Communications we do our best to erase many of these negative perceptions and restore public confidence in the profession and our clients are always satisfied with our service delivery and that is integrity which is our core value that can never be compromised\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, she further stated that, professionals can change the perception through the way they present themselves to the clients and by extension public, in the course of running the business and execution of tasks so as to meet the increasing demands and satisfaction of the clients.",

          "text": "On July 1, 2022, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited legally transformed into a company whose operations and activities are regulated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA.\n\nThe NNPC\u2019s transformation into a CAMA company follows the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari will officially unveil the new NNPC Ltd on July 19, and invited all players in the sector to be part of the epoch-making event.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, had on September 21, last year completed the incorporation of the NNPC Ltd in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act PIA, 2021, which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16, 2021, following its passage by the National Assembly in July of the same year.\n\nSection 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of the enactment of the PIA in consultation with the minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the company.\n\nIn line with that, the registration by the CAC, the NNPC Ltd was floated with an initial capital of N200 billion making history as the company with the highest share capital in the country.\n\nMele Kyari, the group managing director, of the company, in his avowed openness and drive for transparency, had made proactive moves in preparation for the July 1 take-off as a CAMA company.\n\nIn that preparatory initiative, Kyari\u2019s led NNPC, had engaged the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, the ministry of Petroleum Resources, ministry of Finance, governors, legislators, host communities and other key stakeholders to fully comprehend impact of the Act.\n\nConsequently, NNPC had set up a PIA transition committee with specific directive to drive the transitioning of NNPC into a full CAMA company.\n\nThere was also an in-house committee backed by globally acclaimed consultants (McKinsey, KPMG, PWC, Wood McKenzie and Olaniwun Ajayi, LP) to define and implement the transition roadmap.\n\nThe road map includes valuation of the assets and liabilities, development of corporate governance frameworks, rebranding of NNPC to NNPC Ltd and change management.\n\nThe transition of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd into an entity that would be regulated in line with the provisions of the companies and Allied Matters Act and this will largely position it as a partner of choice to all oil and gas companies globally.\n\nAccording to Kyari, one of the things that will be different as the NNPC transitions is that it is expected to become a commercially oriented and profit-driven national petroleum company that would be the envy of all players in the sector.\n\nHe explained further that the NNPC would be managed like a private sector enterprise and unlike previously when it was owned by the government, the NNPC is expected to become more efficient in its operations.\n\nThis, he noted, will enable the company to effectively maximize returns on investment for the 200 million Nigerians, ensure returns for shareholders and pay taxes to the government.\n\nThe PIA is largely expected to fully transform the nation\u2019s petroleum industry into a hub of business operations will also attract huge capital globally into the country\u2019s oil sector, strengthen cost recovery and ensure decent returns on investment.\n\nAdditionally, the law is expected to promote good governance in the oil and gas sector in tandem with the international best practices.\n\nKyari, said: \u201cIt will help us to have a very transparent, clearly competitive physical framework, where you get to see opportunities on where you can put your money and also get back your money with some benefits.\n\n\u201cIt will also refocus on gas development in our country such that as we know gas is the new oil.\n\n\u201cFor over 20 years, we have made attempt to change our petroleum negotiate so that we will be in line with expertise industry, which will lead to smarter opportunities. We have been very stagnant for over 24 years without any physical change.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the last few days is simply a transformation of activities and transformation of the environment for doing business, making our country very competitive.\u201d\n\nSince he came on board in 2019 as NNPC helmsman, Kyari, who has focused in ensuring the passage of the legislation, has been a major advocate on the need for the lawmakers to pass the bill which he described as a \u201cgame-changer for Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, getting the petroleum legislation passed is the right thing to do because investors will not invest their money if they are not sure of how they are going to get their investment back, and what benefits they can get from their investment, as well as how stable the investment climate is.\n\nHe explained:\u201cWe are aware that the whole world is becoming a petroleum territory and no country will survive except you have a very competitive physical environment.\n\n\u201cWhat is logic to us is to bring us abound with the best of physical environment that is available in the world, bringing us to a place where also structure of regulation that is also in line with best practices in the world clearly separating the upstream from the midstream and downstream so that our focus can come back to the part of the industry that will surely be the hub.\n\n\u201cFor our investors what this means is that there is clarity of our physical environment, there is also a very robust commercial framework, there is also a competitive physical framework.\n\n\u201cSo the combination of these three to new investors and existing investors is that they can now take opportunity of the industry. Friendly business environment will guarantee cost recovery and a decent return on investment for investors.\n\n\u201cThe combination of these is that NNPC will be the house of opportunities, expand our partnerships, and it will be a very big opportunity for new investors and the country. I think this is a very exciting moment for us as a country.\u201d\n\nOn expected changes in the corporation\u2019s assets after the PIA with regards to the incorporation of NNPC as a company under the CAMA, Kyari, reiterated that all assets and liabilities of the NNPC will be transferred to the new company.\n\nAs NNPC draw down the curtain as a state-run enterprise and transform into a private company under its new status, it will pay taxes and dividends to its shareholders like other companies.\n\nExcitingly, one of the things that will be different in the NNPC transition is that it will become a commercially oriented and profit-driven national petroleum company independent of government and audited annually.\n\nGoing forward, the NNPC would be managed like a private sector enterprise and unlike previously when it was owned by the government, the NNPC is expected to become more efficient in its operations. This will enable the Company to effectively maximize returns on investment for the 200 million Nigerians, ensure returns for shareholders and pay taxes to the government.\n\nWhere there is an impact of its operations on prices of petroleum products, the government will be expected to determine how the differential will be managed. What this implies is that impact of prices will not automatically be transferred to the citizens as the government remains committed to providing energy security and sustaining the economy.\n\nGoing by the transitioning, the NNPC\u2019s operations will not be subsidised by the government because as a CAMA Company, it would be expected to pay dividends to shareholders which in this case is the government.\n\nKyari provided more understanding to this when he said recently that the National Oil Company will serve as a holding company for all its subsidiaries in the post PIA era.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, these shareholders can decide, as the law provides that over time, they can reduce the shareholding into some private shareholding. That means it can be floated subsequently as a company that is quoted on the stock exchange. The intention at the very onset is not to go to that step but there is provision in the law that allows us ultimately to sell shares of this company.\n\n\u201cThis is very simple. This company will pay taxes and royalties, which are revenues that accrue to the federation. So, every part of this country and every sub national institution or government will benefit from it.\n\n\u201cSecondly, this company will pay company income tax that also comes to the federation for the benefit of all. So, what is different is that this company will now have profit to make and declare dividend, which will be decided by the board of directors of this company.\u201d\n\nThe new NNPC is also expected to enter new investments and partnerships in upstream assets to increase gas production in line with the decade of gas agenda.\n\nAlready, the NNPC had secured a $5bn corporate finance commitment from the African Export Import Bank to fund major investments in Nigeria\u2019s Upstream sector.\n\nThe NNPC\u2019s $5 billion corporate finance commitment from Afreximbank is seen by oil industry stakeholders as a dividend of the Petroleum Industry Act and the incorporation of the NNPC as a limited liability company.\n\nUnder the NNPC Ltd funding strategy for selected upstream investments, the Company would be raising between $3.5bn and $5bn as corporate finance to fund major upstream investments.\n\nTo NNPC would be taken over ownership from non-investing partner through acquisition of pre-emption rights in the sample Joint Venture and the strategy would also see the company investing in assets to address integrity, bottlenecking and growth issues including rig-less activities, and drilling campaigns in the oil industry.\n\nThe funding would also be used to finance part of the NNPC\u2019s investment including acquisition of interest in quality upstream oil and gas producing assets.\n\nGoing by the projections of Kyari, the NNPC will soon emerge the fifth largest gas producing in the world given that the new legislation has provided business opportunities that will enable the NNPC earn more revenue for the country and attract foreign direct investment into the Nigerian energy sector.\n\nIn this new dispensation the NNPC is better positioned to play its role in ensuring energy security for the country.\n\nNigeria launched its decade of gas in February last year in a move to transition into clean energy and as well eliminate energy poverty, eating up about 40 per cent of its population.\n\nThe NNPC is currently deepening natural gas utilisation to reduce energy poverty through the National Gas Expansion Programme and intensifying the use of petrochemicals and also making concerted efforts in the Gas sector through various projects such as NLNG Train 7, AKK, OB3, ELPS and others.\n\nIt is also involved in the expansion and integration of domestic/regional power grids and growing the domestic gas markets through Autogas/Compressed Natural Gas/Liquified Petroleum Gas to power vehicles.\n\nThe GMD, hailed President Muhammadu Buhari, for having the courage to ensure that the PIA, despite various opposition, becomes law.\n\nHe said over 50 years, the country has been struggling with fiscal and regulatory framework in the oil and gas sector that were uncompetitive.\n\nIncrease Crude Production, Forex Will End Fuel Scarcity \u2013 NNPC\n\nKyari said that over the years, the passage of the PIA was resisted by stakeholders in the oil and gas industry for selfish reasons.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am sure all of us are aware of the struggles that we \u2018ve had to ensure we have the right fiscal and regulatory framework in place to make sure that companies operate in the best environment that is possible and very competitive.\n\n\u201cWe have struggled to have the right fiscal space not just for 20 years but since 1967. As you may be aware, the Petroleum Profit Tax Act 1967, the Petroleum Act 1969, there wasn\u2019t any significant change from what you have from the Petroleum Tax Act and the Petroleum Act.\n\n\u201cThis means that we have frozen our environment for over 50 years, and that took its toll which is very visible in our recent history in the sense that in the last ten years, investment inflow in Sub-Sahara Africa and other countries into Nigeria has been just about $3bn to $3.5bn in real terms.\n\n\u201cNot just in spendings that we are seeing, in real capital expenditure that are designed to improve on production. And the reason is very simple, we don\u2019t have the right fiscal structure, we don\u2019t have the right climate, we don\u2019t have the right regulatory stability, right framework where people can predict what will happen next.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why there is under investment, there is lack of growth, and of course it produced some other results part of which is that many of our partners now both the dependent and independent have not invested substantially.\n\n\u201cNobody invested in new projects. And the end results were that when you get to some of these facilities, you will think that you are in a war zone. Many of them looked like museums and they are not design to function.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to mention names of companies but we know that in every major facility, except the new ones that are just being put in place, you just discovered that something is wrong.\n\n\u201cAnd all this is because there isn\u2019t the right framework for business and they don\u2019t have faith in our fiscal system and that does not justify why we did the little we have done.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that is what led to the situation today. But thank God, prosperity was thrown at us and with all humility, let me put it straight that without a President Buhari, we would not have had a PIA.\n\n\u201cBecause over the years, the passage of the legislation was resisted by the industry, by the independent, dependent and the NNPC and sometimes for very simple reasons that people will lose power, people will lose control and people will lose influence. And this makes us to keep struggling over little issues.\u201d",

          "text": "On July 1, 2022, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited legally transformed into a company whose operations and activities are regulated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA.\n\nThe NNPC\u2019s transformation into a CAMA company follows the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari will officially unveil the new NNPC Ltd on July 19, and invited all players in the sector to be part of the epoch-making event.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, had on September 21, last year completed the incorporation of the NNPC Ltd in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act PIA, 2021, which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16, 2021, following its passage by the National Assembly in July of the same year.\n\nSection 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of the enactment of the PIA in consultation with the minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the company.\n\nIn line with that, the registration by the CAC, the NNPC Ltd was floated with an initial capital of N200 billion making history as the company with the highest share capital in the country.\n\nMele Kyari, the group managing director, of the company, in his avowed openness and drive for transparency, had made proactive moves in preparation for the July 1 take-off as a CAMA company.\n\nIn that preparatory initiative, Kyari\u2019s led NNPC, had engaged the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, the ministry of Petroleum Resources, ministry of Finance, governors, legislators, host communities and other key stakeholders to fully comprehend impact of the Act.\n\nConsequently, NNPC had set up a PIA transition committee with specific directive to drive the transitioning of NNPC into a full CAMA company.\n\nThere was also an in-house committee backed by globally acclaimed consultants (McKinsey, KPMG, PWC, Wood McKenzie and Olaniwun Ajayi, LP) to define and implement the transition roadmap.\n\nThe road map includes valuation of the assets and liabilities, development of corporate governance frameworks, rebranding of NNPC to NNPC Ltd and change management.\n\nThe transition of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd into an entity that would be regulated in line with the provisions of the companies and Allied Matters Act and this will largely position it as a partner of choice to all oil and gas companies globally.\n\nAccording to Kyari, one of the things that will be different as the NNPC transitions is that it is expected to become a commercially oriented and profit-driven national petroleum company that would be the envy of all players in the sector.\n\nHe explained further that the NNPC would be managed like a private sector enterprise and unlike previously when it was owned by the government, the NNPC is expected to become more efficient in its operations.\n\nThis, he noted, will enable the company to effectively maximize returns on investment for the 200 million Nigerians, ensure returns for shareholders and pay taxes to the government.\n\nThe PIA is largely expected to fully transform the nation\u2019s petroleum industry into a hub of business operations will also attract huge capital globally into the country\u2019s oil sector, strengthen cost recovery and ensure decent returns on investment.\n\nAdditionally, the law is expected to promote good governance in the oil and gas sector in tandem with the international best practices.\n\nKyari, said: \u201cIt will help us to have a very transparent, clearly competitive physical framework, where you get to see opportunities on where you can put your money and also get back your money with some benefits.\n\n\u201cIt will also refocus on gas development in our country such that as we know gas is the new oil.\n\n\u201cFor over 20 years, we have made attempt to change our petroleum negotiate so that we will be in line with expertise industry, which will lead to smarter opportunities. We have been very stagnant for over 24 years without any physical change.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the last few days is simply a transformation of activities and transformation of the environment for doing business, making our country very competitive.\u201d\n\nSince he came on board in 2019 as NNPC helmsman, Kyari, who has focused in ensuring the passage of the legislation, has been a major advocate on the need for the lawmakers to pass the bill which he described as a \u201cgame-changer for Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, getting the petroleum legislation passed is the right thing to do because investors will not invest their money if they are not sure of how they are going to get their investment back, and what benefits they can get from their investment, as well as how stable the investment climate is.\n\nHe explained:\u201cWe are aware that the whole world is becoming a petroleum territory and no country will survive except you have a very competitive physical environment.\n\n\u201cWhat is logic to us is to bring us abound with the best of physical environment that is available in the world, bringing us to a place where also structure of regulation that is also in line with best practices in the world clearly separating the upstream from the midstream and downstream so that our focus can come back to the part of the industry that will surely be the hub.\n\n\u201cFor our investors what this means is that there is clarity of our physical environment, there is also a very robust commercial framework, there is also a competitive physical framework.\n\n\u201cSo the combination of these three to new investors and existing investors is that they can now take opportunity of the industry. Friendly business environment will guarantee cost recovery and a decent return on investment for investors.\n\n\u201cThe combination of these is that NNPC will be the house of opportunities, expand our partnerships, and it will be a very big opportunity for new investors and the country. I think this is a very exciting moment for us as a country.\u201d\n\nOn expected changes in the corporation\u2019s assets after the PIA with regards to the incorporation of NNPC as a company under the CAMA, Kyari, reiterated that all assets and liabilities of the NNPC will be transferred to the new company.\n\nAs NNPC draw down the curtain as a state-run enterprise and transform into a private company under its new status, it will pay taxes and dividends to its shareholders like other companies.\n\nExcitingly, one of the things that will be different in the NNPC transition is that it will become a commercially oriented and profit-driven national petroleum company independent of government and audited annually.\n\nGoing forward, the NNPC would be managed like a private sector enterprise and unlike previously when it was owned by the government, the NNPC is expected to become more efficient in its operations.

          "text": "Two years after Nigeria recorded 15 jailbreaks across the country, the federal government is yet to track and recapture the over 3,828 escaped inmates roaming the country freely.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that between October 2020 and July 5, 2022, Nigeria has recorded incessant incidence of jailbreak across 11 states with the federal government failing to forestall the embarrassing situation in the country.\n\nRecords has it that between 2020 to December 2021, only 984 out of the 4,369 inmates who fled from various custodial centers in the country were recaptured, thereby leaving a total of 3,385 still at large.\n\nThis is in addition to the 443 yet to be recaptured inmates who fled after members of Boko Haram terrorists stormed the Kuje Custodial Centre (prison) Tuesday night, using high explosives and guns 69 of their members and 260 other inmates.\n\nWhen contacted to furnish this paper with further information as to the additional number of recaptured escapees, the NCoS image maker, Abubakar Umar, told LEADERSHIP Sunday that the service was still documenting details of freshly captured inmates but promised to release it to the public domain once that was concluded.\n\nOnly recently, the minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola had at a media briefing organised by the Presidential Media Team at the State House in Abuja, confirmed that many recaptured inmates who escaped various custodial facilities following coordinated attacks by gunmen in many states were still on the run.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday further gathered that these breakages has also culminated in the death of 38 persons (33 between 20-2021 and 5 in July,2022) including inmates, security operatives and some attackers, while 216 others either sustained minor or severe injuries, enough to require weeks of medical attention.\n\nNCoS Declares 69 Terrorist Inmates Wanted After Kuje Jailbreak\n\nMeanwhile, security experts have expressed concerned that despite promising to ensure that the biodata of all inmates were harmonised with sister agencies, the Nigeria Financial Unit (NFIU), all banks and the INTERPOL to track all escaped inmates, no tangible result has been recorded to that effect.\n\nA security expert, Mr. Thomas Adoye said, \u201cIt is sad that till date, the Nigeria Correctional Service has not been able to harmonise their information. They need to be told that it is also very important to have their fingerprints, pictures and other details to do so successfully.\n\nUmar said, \u201cThe CG, Haliru Nababa is sparing no effort or resources in hunting down all the escapees and it is heart-warming that the integrated strategies are yielding favourable results. He expresses his deep appreciation to security agencies and patriotic Nigerians whose collaboration is facilitating the recovery exercise.\n\n\u2018My boss has assured the public of his irrevocable commitment to bringing back all escapees to answer for their crimes. He therefore appeals that citizens should assist in achieving this task by visiting the Nigerian Correctional Service\u2019s website https://corrections.gov.ng/escapees for the pictures of the escapees and alert the nearest security agency if they suspect or see any of them\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday reports that within the period under review, 9 of these incidents were successful with a total of 5,248 inmates (4,369 between 2020-2021 and 879 in July 2022) initially escaping from their attacked facilities The affected states include: Edo, Ondo, Lagos, Abia, Delta, Imo, Bauchi, Kano, Kogi, Oyo, Plataeu, and the FCT.",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has announced his resignation, hours after a crowd of angry protesters chased him from his residence and set the prime minister\u2019s home on fire, as months of frustration brought on by an unprecedented economic crisis boiled over.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people massed in the capital Colombo to demand the government take responsibility for mismanaging the nation\u2019s finances, and for crippling food and fuel shortages.\n\nstorming the gates of the presidential palace, a throng of protesters walked through its rooms, with some among the boisterous crowd jumping into the compound\u2019s pool.\n\nOthers were seen laughing and lounging in the stately bedrooms of the residence, with one pulling out what he claimed was a pair of Rajapaksa\u2019s underwear.\n\nAt around the same time, the leader had boarded a naval craft at the Colombo port and was taken to the island\u2019s southern waters, where he let it be known he was finally bowing to months of calls for his resignation.\n\n\u2018To ensure a peaceful transition, the president said he will step down on July 13,\u2019 parliamentary speaker Mahinda Abeywardana said in a televised statement.\n\nRajapaksa had to be extracted from his residence by troops who fired into the air to keep the crowd outside at bay.\n\nSoon after they stormed the presidential palace, Rajapaksa\u2019s nearby seafront office also fell into the hands of protesters.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the first person in line to succeed Rajapaksa, called a meeting with political leaders and said he was willing to step down to pave the way for a unity government.\n\nBut that failed to placate protesters, who stormed the premier\u2019s private residence and set it alight after night fell.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a crowd cheering the blaze, which broke out shortly after a security detachment guarding Wickremesinghe attacked several journalists outside the home.\n\nNo casualties have been reported in the fire so far, and police said Wickremesinghe and his family were away at the time.\n\nSecurity forces attempted to disperse the huge crowds that had mobbed Colombo\u2019s administrative district earlier in the day, with dozens injured in the resulting clashes.\n\nA spokeswoman for Colombo\u2019s main hospital said three people were being treated for gunshot wounds, along with 36 others suffering breathing difficulties after being caught up in tear gas barrages.\n\nSome protesters, holding Sri Lankan flags and helmets, also swam in the presidential swimming pool, video footage from local TV news NewsFirst channel showed.\n\nTwo defence ministry sources said President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was removed from the official premises on Friday for his safety ahead of the planned rally over the weekend, with government spokesman Mohan Samaranayake unsure of Rajapaksa\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nThe island of 22 million people is struggling under a severe foreign exchange shortage that has limited essential imports of fuel, food and medicine, plunging it into the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948.\n\nMany blame the country\u2019s decline on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as it muddles through with aid from India and other countries and its leaders try to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe president\u2019s older brother resigned as prime minister in May after violent protests saw him seek safety at a naval base, while three other Rajapaksa relatives had quit their Cabinet posts earlier.\n\nMuch of the public ire has been pointed at the Rajapaksa family, with protesters blaming them for dragging Sri Lanka into chaos with poor management and allegations of corruption and nepotism.\n\nA new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, took over in May to help steer the country out of the crisis. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa has held on to power despite largely peaceful protests since March demanding his resignation.\n\nThousands of people swarmed into Colombo\u2019s government district, shouting slogans against the president and dismantling several police barricades to reach Rajapaksa\u2019s house, a witness said.\n\nThere were even reports that angry protesters from out of town had forced railway staff to run trains to take them to Colombo.\n\nThousands of people broke through barricades and entered President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s residence and nearby office to vent their anger against a leader they hold responsible for the nation\u2019s worst crisis.\n\nFootage showed people in a jubilant mood taking a dip in the garden pool of the residence. Some lay on beds, others made tea and drank, and made \u2018statements\u2019 from the conference room that Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe must immediately quit.\n\nWickremesinghe said he suggested to the president to have an all-party government, but didn\u2019t say anything about Rajapaksa\u2019s whereabouts. Opposition parties in Parliament were currently discussing the formation of a new government.\n\nRajapaksa appointed Wickremesinghe as prime minister in May in the hope that the career politician would use his diplomacy and contacts to resuscitate a collapsed economy.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

Others are Muhammad Daiyabu Paki, Aliyu Usman and the only foreign national of Pakistani origin, Dr. Muhammad Abuzar Afzal.\n\nMamu disclosed that the seven released hostages have been handed over to the military and that they were in their way to Kaduna.\n\nMamu, while reiterating the power of mediation in addressing the security challenges bedeviling the country, claimed that he singlehandedly facilitated and initiated the release of the seven kidnapped victims with support from Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\n\u201cThat is why I keep emphasising that government has the power to end the agony of this innocent victims in one day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is just one individual that sacrifice his life and even integrity. There is no military solution to the current security debacle in Nigeria. When you sincerely engage them this guys even though wicked with misguided religious beliefs, they are listening. I have sufficient evidence to probe that they due listen. It is this power of engagement and sincerity that resulted to the release of this 7 victims\u201d.\n\nWhile he thanks the General Officer Commanding the one Mechanized Division of the Nigerian Army for the support during the negotiation and the subsequent release of the hostages, Mamu however lamented that despite the poor medical condition of many of the released hostages, there was unnecessary security checks which wasted \u201ctheir time in a military unit at the outskirts of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThe location they (abductors) gave is remote, sensitive and risky. There was a military checkpoint before penetrating the forest. My team was stopped by the soldiers but when they told the military our mission they contacted the GOC and he immediately gave approval for them to proceed. And after the victims were successfully evacuated, travelling through over 40 kilometers in the forest, they were given a military escort back to Kaduna at the checkpoint\u201d.",

          "text": "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has decried the rising cost of diesel in the country and urged the federal government to issue its members licences to import the product from the Republic of Niger and Chad.\n\nThe association, which raised the alarm that industries were being converted to warehouses of imported goods and event centres, also called on the federal government to avert the total shutdown of production operations.\n\nThe Director-General of MAN, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, made the call in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos.\n\nMAN represents more than 3,000 manufacturers spread across 10 sectors, 76 sub-sectors, and 16 industrial zones.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, which dominates export trade in the West African sub-region, employs more than five million workers, directly and indirectly, and contributes 8.46 per cent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAjayi-Kadir stated that the call was pertinent during times of crisis to enhance the performance of the sector through a pro-manufacturing policy that would encourage scale-up and lower unit cost of production.\n\nHe added that the manufacturing sector had been battered by many familiar challenges that had plummeted the number of industries and converted industrial hubs to warehouses of imported goods and event centres.\n\nThe MAN president also stated that top on the list of challenges confronting the sector was high operating cost caused by the twin problem of inadequate electricity supply and the high cost of alternative energy sources.\n\nHe added that the more than 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel had become a major constraint with spiral effects.\n\n\u201cMAN is greatly concerned about the implications of the over 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector in particular.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the deafening silence from the public sector as regards the plight of manufacturers,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nAjayi-Kadir urged the government to strengthen the nation\u2019s economic absorbers from external shocks to reduce the myriad challenges the manufacturing sector was already beguiled with.\n\nHe stated that by the time the current domestic reserve of manufacturing inputs was exhausted, prices of manufactured products would soar in the face of an acute shortfall in supply.\n\nAjayi-Kadir added that government should continue to support manufacturing to accelerate the process of recovery from the aftermath of COVID-19 and previous bouts of recession.\n\nThis, he explained, would avert a complete shutdown of factories nationwide.\n\nHe urged the government to issue licenses to manufacturing concerns and operators in the aviation industry to import diesel and aviation fuel directly to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing.\n\nAjayi-Kadir also called for the removal of VAT on diesel as an instant stimulus for an immediate price reduction and expedite action in reactivating or privatising petroleum products refineries in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of urgency, the government should address the challenge of repeated collapses of the national grid which is causing acute electricity shortage, especially for manufacturers,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nMeanwhile, MAN has also asked the federal government to issue its members licences to import diesel from the Republic of Niger and Chad, Nigeria\u2019s neighbouring countries, to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing activities that could arise from the total shut down of production operations.\n\nThe MAN also tasked the government to develop a response strategy to address challenges emanating from the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe MAN said: \u201cIn light of the gravity of the precarious situation that we have found ourselves as a nation and the looming dangers ahead, the expectations of manufacturers in Nigeria are as follows: that government should urgently allow manufacturers and independent petroleum products marketing companies to also import AGO (diesel) from the Republic of Niger and Chad by immediately opening up border posts in that axis to cushion the effect of the supply gap driven the high cost of AGO (Automotive Gas Oil).\u201d\n\nThe association also requested the government to \u201cissue licences to manufacturing concerns and operators in the aviation industry to import diesel and aviation fuel directly to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing activities arising from total shut down of production operations and movement of persons for business activities.\u201d\n\nAjayi-Kadir noted that Nigerian manufacturers are greatly concerned about the implications of the over 200 per cent increase in the price of AGO on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the deafening silence from the public sector as regards the plight of manufacturers. Four obvious questions that readily come to mind that are seriously begging for answers are: What can we do as a nation to strengthen our economic absorbers from external shocks? Should manufacturing companies that are already battered with multiple taxes, poor access to foreign exchange, and now over 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel be advised to shut down operations? Should we fold our arms and allow the economy to slip into the valley of recession again? Is the nation well equipped to manage the resulting explosive inflation and unemployment rates?\u201d he asked.\n\nIt also implored the government to \u201ccontinue to support manufacturing to accelerate the process of recovery from the aftermath of COVID-19 and previous bouts of recession to avert the complete shutdown of factories nationwide with a multiplier effect on the employment.\u201d\n\nThe MAN also asked the federal government to \u201cas a matter of priority develops a National Response and Sustainability Strategy (NRSS) to address challenges emanating from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\u201d\n\nThe MAN also tasked the government to \u201caddress the challenge of the repeated collapse of the national grid (twice within a week), which is causing acute electricity shortage in the country, especially for manufacturers,\u201d adding that government should \u201cremove VAT on AGO as an instant stimulus for an immediate price reduction and expedite action in reactivating or privatising the petroleum products refineries in the country.\u201d\n\nIt also demanded that the government should \u201crestrict the export of maize, cassava, wheat, food-related products and other manufacturing inputs available in the country; and grant concessional foreign exchange allocation at the official rate to manufacturers for the importation of productive inputs that are not locally available.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "A plot by some southern governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party to remove its National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu from office is gaining momentum.\n\nThus, the embattled former President of the Senate has returned to the country to meet the governors and other stakeholders.\n\nAccording to THISDAY, some of the governors are championing the removal of Ayu from office in line with the zoning principle, which ensures that the national chairman of the party and its presidential candidate should not come from one geographical zone.\n\nThe investigation further revealed that with the return of Ayu from vacation, the party has activated a series of meetings to starve off the agitation for his removal from office.\n\nSome chieftains of the party who spoke to THISDAY stated that he rushed back to Nigeria to meet the aggrieved stakeholders.\n\nMultiple sources said the calls for his resignation were being amplified by the members of the camp of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, who feel the former Senate President was not neutral but sided with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar during the presidential primary.\n\nIt was also gathered that some of the PDP governors who are sympathetic to Ayu, including his state governor, Samuel Ortom of Benue State have stepped in to avert his removal.\n\nAlso to address the grievances of some governors of the PDP over the choice of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, the chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Mr Walid Jubrin is said to be championing a reconciliation meeting with the governors of the party to appease Rivers State Governor, Mr Nyesom Wike.\n\nA member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party told THISDAY that \u201cit is not that the governors of the party are insisting that Atiku must change Okowa. No! We want all issues to be put on the table and let them be addressed as in the case of who gets what.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman is back and he has lined up a series of meetings to address this perceived crisis, including agitations for his removal.\n\n\u201cHe is billed to meet the PDP governors, the BoT members and even former PDP governors and Atiku once he returns to the country. It is expected that Ayu will use the Sallah break to reach out to those aggrieved as well as those perceived as his friends.\n\n\u201cThe meetings to follow must address the power-sharing when the PDP comes to power.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be blind followership. Every group must know what is in stock for it. We are sure that after the meetings, these agitations will reduce\u201d, the NWC member said.\n\nThe source explained that it was agreed that at the pre-convention stages in October 2021 that if the presidential candidate comes from the North, the National Chairman should resign.\n\nHe argued that \u201cthis may not be the best time for a leadership change from the top, but what ought to be addressed should be addressed. We are sure that with Ayu, the series of consultations and meetings with the PDP governors\u2019 forum and other stakeholders will commence immediately after the Sallah break.

          "text": "Former Nigerian Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has said nothing will come out of Friday\u2019s visit by the Governors of Ekiti, Ondo and Lagos states (Kayode Fayemi, Rotimi Akeredolu and Babajide Sanwo-Olu) to their Rivers State counterpart (Nyesom Wike) in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe three APC governors were said to be in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, apparently to woo the aggrieved PDP governor to the ruling APC.\n\nBut Saraki who spoke with journalists on Friday night in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on the visit, said it would amount to nothing at the end of the day, adding that PDP would not allow Wike to leave the main opposition party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cGovernor Wike is an important member of our party and I am very confident that in no distant time, we will sit down and address all the issues.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about it that he has cause to feel the way he does, but there are better ways by which issues like this would be resolved.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that we are all talking to one another. We are on top of the situation and PDP will reunite and forge ahead to win the next elections.\n\n\u201cI assure you that PDP will resolve the family issues that it currently has,\u201d he said.\n\nSaraki added: \u201cThe fact that some APC governors went to see their colleague, trying to capitalise on what they think is an issue is a gross miscalculation. At the end of the day, their visit is going nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe APC governors know that it is this kind of a crack they need to latch on to. Fortunately, we are not going to give him (Wike) to them because the election ahead is too important.\n\n\u201cThe destinies of millions of Nigerians are too important and even bigger than any party or individual. I appreciate that; all our stakeholders appreciate that and Governor Wike himself appreciates that.\u201d\n\nOn the current strike by university unions in Nigeria, the ex-governor of Kwara State blamed it on the federal government\u2019s insensitivity.\n\nSenator Saraki added: \u201cThere is no way I will be part of the government as the Senate President and ASUU and other unions in the universities will go on strike for months.\n\n\u201cIt is a lack of compassion and dedication. It is a matter that government should lock itself up in a room and not come out until the matter is resolved.\n\n\u201cAnd I have not seen that dedication. I don\u2019t know whether you have seen it.\n\n\u201cThat is the difference between the PDP government and what we have now. It could not have happened under Presidents Obasanjo, Yar\u2019Adua and Jonathan,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nHe, however, predicted that the PDP would form the next government to return the governance of the country to the people and also boost their socio-economic well-being.\n\nHammed Shittu in Ilorin",

          "text": "The Nasarawa State Police Command on Saturday said it recaptured a Boko Haram suspect, Hassan Hassan, who was among the inmates that escaped from the Kuje Maximum Custodial Centre in Abuja. Meanwhile, the federal government said it has tightened security around the Kuje Correctional facility and other parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Nasarawa State command, DSP Ramhan Nansel added that the fleeing Boko Haram suspect was recaptured at Keffi, headquarters of Keffi Local Government Area of the state. Nansel said: \u201cSequel to the attack on Kuje Maximum Custodial Centre and subsequent escape of inmates, on July 9th, 2022 at about 0130hrs, one Hassan Hassan \u2018M\u2019 whose name and picture was amongst the escaped inmates with Boko Haram/Terrorism case was recaptured by the eagle-eyed Police operatives of the Nasarawa State Police Command at Keffi. \u201cThe Commissioner of Police, CP Adesina Soyemi has ordered for the transfer of the suspect to a safer location while the intensive search for other escapees and handing over process of the arrested inmate progresses.\u201d Meanwhile, following the terrorist attack on Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s federal government says it has tightened security around the facility and other parts of the FCT.\n\nThe Controller-General of the Nigeria Correctional Services (NCoS), Haliru Nababa, said the service would spare no effort or resources in hunting down all the escapees from the Kuje facility.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that new security arrangements are in place to prevent a repeat occurrence.\n\nAs part of the new security measures, the meetings of security forces headed by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, have been brought forward to hold daily from its previous weekly arrangement.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that new security checkpoints were mounted at the entry and exit points of the Kuje Area council while similar deployments encircled the prison facility and the area council.\n\nNababa said the integrated strategies of the security agencies were yielding favourable results.\n\nThe NCoS also said there was no case of missing monies in both local and foreign currencies belonging to inmates in the centre after the ill-fated attack on the facility.\n\nThe incessant attacks on FCT suburbs and the recent one on the Kuje facility had also heightened tension among residents in the nation\u2019s capital, forcing those in the city centre to commence construction of new fences around their residential houses.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Brigade of Guards, responsible for the security of the president and his family, also reinforced troop deployments at the entry and exit points of the city, notably, the Nyanya-Karu and Maraba-Keffi axis and Gwagwalada-Zuba and Kubwa on the northern flank of the territory.\n\nThe FCT Police Command in a statement issued Friday night said it had put in place water-tight security around Abuja.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe CP (Babaji Sunday) further noted that in pursuance of the common resolve to beef-up security, the command would intensify robust stop and search operations, high-level visibility policing patrols and surveillance of places of worship, parks, recreational centres and residential areas, and prompt response to any distress calls from across the FCT.\u201d\n\nGiven the security situation in Abuja, the command also warned Muslim worshippers not to park their vehicles 200 metres close to the praying grounds.\n\n\u201cWorshippers are therefore advised to pray inside and avoid praying on the expressway to ensure orderliness and proper traffic management.\n\n\u201cAt all other praying grounds within the FCT, no vehicle will be permitted to park 200 metres close to the praying grounds. Worshippers and residents are therefore advised to cooperate with police officers deployed strictly for enforcement,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn a related development, the NCoS said there was no case of missing monies in both local and foreign currencies belonging to inmates in the centre after the ill-fated attack on the facility.\n\nPublic Relations Officer of the service, Umar Danlami Abubakar, in a statement, affirmed that the cash belonging to inmates deposited in the custody of the authorities of the custodial centre is intact and safe.\n\nHe reiterated that there was an existing instruction from the Controller General of Corrections, Nadaba, that all officers superintending custodial centres must not keep huge sums in the facility.\n\nIgbawase Ukumba in Lafia",
