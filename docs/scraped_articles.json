          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nA coalition of Christian and Muslim groups in the country under the aegis of the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDFP), on Wednesday, said with the increasing level of insecurity, uncertainty and disunity among the people, the country was at a crossroads ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe organisation, therefore, said the nation was in dire need of capable hands who can unite the citizens and secure the nation to run for political offices so they could emerge as elected leaders, especially at the federal level.\n\nThe Forum said such leaders should also be those who were bold enough to always say the truth and connect with the realities of the people they were governing.\n\nThe IDFP raised these issues during its 4th Annual Peace Conference and General Assembly held in Abuja with the theme, \u2018Building and Sustaining the Culture of Peaceful Elections in Nigeria: The Role of Faith and Traditional Leaders\u2019.\n\nThe event, attended by over 120 religious leaders mainly of Muslim and Christian faiths, was anchored and moderated by the IDFP Co-Publicity Secretaries, Dr Uzoaku Williams and Alhaji Mohammed Sani Isah.\n\nThe IDFP, however, called on serving leaders across the country to be patriotic and put the people first in their approach to governance.\n\nIn his paper presentation, Prof. Usman Yusuf said: \u201cThe country is a lot more divided along ethnic and religious lines. Our restless youths are being fed a cocktail of toxic ethnoreligious poison mostly by failed politicians. We all have duties and responsibilities, considering the state of our nation.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at a crossroads. We are facing the worse insecurity of our lifetime, which is threatening the very foundations of this nation and our young and fragile democracy.\n\n\u201cAlthough there\u2019s a role for the military in resolving the conflict, military action is not the solution. Victory in situations like this cannot be won on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nHe urged all clerics in the country to constantly charge political leaders, especially those saddled with the responsibility of securing the lives of citizens to bring an end to the country\u2019s insecurity, warning that \u201cwithout security, 2023 will be a bridge too far.\u201d\n\nIn their message, the Co-chairmen, IDFP, Alhaji Ishaq Kunle Sanni and Bishop Sunday Onuoha, said many politicians were disconnected from the current realities in the land as well as the daily sufferings of their people.\n\nThey, nonetheless, urged the youths not to allow themselves to be used by unscrupulous politicians for violence in the forthcoming elections, adding that the country already has enough security challenges.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that many politicians in Abuja can no longer go back to their villages and communities because they are disconnected from the people. Everyone must go back to his community. Governance should be done in the grassroots communities.\n\n\u201cOur elections have been characterised by violence, chaos and all sorts of unwholesome practices. The generality of our youths must be appealed to, not to allow themselves to be used by politicians,\u201d the clerics said.\n\nAbove all, the duo urged fellow pulpit managers to use their platforms to also preach and speak peace to the people ahead of next year\u2019s general election.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) on Wednesday said the most urgent task before its members at the moment was the search for detribalised politicians who are free from moral encumbrances to run for elective offices in order to unite the people and secure the nation.\n\nThe organisation also said that nobody could stop the North from fielding and backing candidates for the presidency\n\nCNG said some governors in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cannot stop the fielding of Northern presidential candidates in the party because of the resolve of the members of the group to resist such an attempt.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, the Spokesman of CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, maintained that a statement credited to Governor Nyesom Wike, saying, in a veiled reference to some prominent Northern presidential aspirants in the PDP, that made the party lose in 2015, was an indication that he was set to deploy hateful utterances against the North and anything northern instead of pursuing his political aspiration by an issue-based approach.\n\nSuleiman stressed that though some politicians in the North might have been compromised by the perceived anti-Northern elements in the Pro, this would not deter the region from going ahead to field and support a Northern presidential candidate in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the representatives of various interest groups from Northern Nigeria, the CNG is no longer disposed to watching with restraint to the point of condoning and accommodating such unreasonable and unacceptable conduct perpetrated against northern interests by the Wikes and their lackeys.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, no amount of blackmail, intimidation, brigandage, gangsterism or rascality by Wike or any other person or group from whichever ever section of the country and in whichever party can stop the North from fielding and backing candidates for the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe categorically warn that the plot to use Ortom\u2019s zoning Committee to deprive the North the opportunity to field candidates for the election would not work, as nothing would stop northerners contesting the presidency in all the parties.\n\n\u201cWe call the attention of Wike and the gang up against the North to realize and accept the reality that whatever zoning arrangement that might have existed in particularly the PDP, had been jettisoned, discredited, abandoned and utterly destroyed by their own selfish actions in 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u201cIn place of any rotation arrangement that has not and would never work, the North is rather focusing on the necessity of searching for an upright, physically healthy, mentally alert, knowledgeable, detribalized leader free of any moral encumbrances.\n\n\u201cWe warn Wike and his ilk in the PDP and elsewhere to concentrate on issue-based debates if they have any, as we would certainly not hesitate to expose their past hateful utterances against the North and anything northern.\u201d",

          "text": "Annie Idibia\u2019s eldest brother, Wisdom Macaulay, has accused her of shortchanging him after introducing him to hard drugs.\n\nIn a video on his Instagram page, the father of three accused his younger sister of exploiting him without due remuneration.\n\nHe alleged Annie told him off for failing to show up after two weeks of being away to sort out some family issues.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to rescue him for the alleged exploitation his sister has subjected him to.\n\nHe said: \u201cHello, Nigerians. My name is Wisdom Macaulay, I am the elder brother of Annie Macaulay Idibia. I\u2019m crying out for help at this moment because my life is being threatened.\n\n\u201cI have been working with my sister for some time but she would never pay me my dues. She would rather send me N20,000 or N30,000\u2026turn me to her slave and at the end of the day, she can decide to end it when she is angry.\n\n\u201cSome weeks back, her husband sent me some money that I have begging him for years. The money wasn\u2019t so much but I used it to settle my home. I have a wife from Imo State. I am sorry that I\u2019ve not come to do the rightful thing to pay your daughter\u2019s dowry. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been manipulated for many years.\u201d\n\nAccusing his sister of having introduced him to drugs, Macaulay said: \u201cAnnie introduced me to drugs, hard drugs, Annie takes drugs, she is a drug addict. She takes it every day, she is so violent.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s the same way she doesn\u2019t have peace with anybody. She quarrels with everybody, she fights everybody. I defended her because I love her as a sister but I now realised she doesn\u2019t even have love or any good intentions for me.\u201d\n\nExplaining how Annie eventually sent him away, he said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t around for 2 weeks because I had my own issues. And when I came back, begging my sister with the work and everything. She decided to take everything from me. She took away the job.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t give me a car. I have been begging my sister for a car to do Uber for many years now. So that I can on my own provide for my wife and three children. My sister has never responded to me.\n\n\u201cI came back to beg her for the manager job she had offered me but she rather turned me to her errand boy, she turned me to a slave. Annie is evil. She doesn\u2019t want me to stand on her own.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been begging Annie for an opportunity to stand on my own but she will not give me a chance.

          "text": "\u2022Accuses Citibank of falsifying documents\n\nUdora Orizu and Juliet Akoje\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on the recovery of N1.2 trillion unclaimed funds in commercial banks; Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government; and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said it had discovered over N300 billion since the beginning of its investigation. Chairman of the committee, Unyime Idem (PDP, Akwa Ibom) disclosed this yesterday after a session with Citibank.\n\nIn a related development, the House Committee on Public Accounts on Tuesday demanded documentary evidence of assets imported by MTN, which amounted to the total sum of N2.6 trillion capital allowances collected by the telco from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Chairman of the committee, Hon. Wole Oke, made the demand during an investigative hearing on the audit queries issued by the office of Auditor General of the Federation (oAuGF) following allegations of tax evasion.\n\nIdem stressed that the committee was mandated, after a resolution of the House on January 26, to investigate and recover the N1.2 trillion due to the federal government that was trapped in commercial banks, MDAs, and other places. He said the trapped funds were in dormant bank accounts in domestic and foreign currencies, accounts without Bank Verification Number (BVN), failed contracts, and excess unremitted funds.\n\nDuring the investigative hearing, the lawmakers alleged that Citibank owed the federal government N99 billion from accumulated failed transactions and hanging funds.\n\nIdem stressed, \u201cA situation where we have been borrowing money to fund major capital projects while we can get such within is unacceptable. So far we have discovered N300 billion, which is just a little percentage of what we are trying to recover.\u201d\n\nHe said the committee was still studying documents and reports sent to it by banks and government agencies, adding that this would help the committee to recover more funds.\n\nAccording to Idem, \u201cThe commercial banks are regulated by government and they cannot refuse us. This assignment is crucial. We will not allow any government agency or commercial bank to undermine our power.\n\n\u201cIf the commercial banks fail to appear, the next line of action will be to summon.\u201d\n\nMembers of the adhoc committee had raised the alarm over the differences in the documents submitted by Citibank, which showed dissimilar figures and number of customers from the previous documents submitted by the bank.\n\nHon. Mohammed Bio alleged that the action of the bank was criminal and insisted that the representative of the financial institution should be put on oath to explain the difference.\n\nBio stated, \u201cThey (Citi bank) had earlier submitted an account record of customers without BVN with a number of 11 people with huge sums of money but today they made another submission on the content but the figures and number of customers stood at seven, with just little money to their names, which makes it curious.\n\n\u201cWhat are they trying to hide or could this be an afterthought that they had to bring this new documents.\u201d\n\nResponding to the lawmakers\u2019 queries, Executive Director, Operations and Technology, Citibank, Mrs. Ngozi Omokeme, who represented the bank, said the financial institution had nothing to hide and the documents submitted were not falsified.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, we are not here to change any documents,\u201d Omokeme said, adding, \u201cAlso, I am not here to falsify any documents. The documents are consistently the same.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the House Committee on Public Accounts demanded evidence from MTN to justify N2.6 trillion capital allowances it collected from FIRS.\n\nThe chairman of the committee, however, acknowledged the communication sent by MTN\u2019s accounting officer, which was delivered by a delegation led by its Head, Public Affairs, Mr. Anas Galadima.\n\nThe letter read, in part, \u201cWe refer to your letter on the above subject matter dated March 24, 2022 inviting us to furnish the House of Representatives Public Account Committee with additional documents on or before Tuesday, March 29, 2022 and appear before the committee on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the content of the letter and require more time. In this regard, we therefore request for your kind consideration to revert to the committee on April, with our position.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairman expressed concern over the misgivings surrounding the investigative hearing on the alleged tax evasion by MTN, but assured the company and all the stakeholders that the committee had no intention of witch-hunting anyone.\n\nOke said, \u201cLet me state very clearly why we invited MTN. We invited MTN based on the infractions spotted by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation on non-presentation, evaluation of certificates of acceptance of capital allowances. That is the query issued by the Auditor General of the Federation.\n\n\u201cIf you are not a financial person, you may not know or understand the implications. I want to clear this so that there is no ambiguity over the presentation in any medium of media platform.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating tax evasion; tax evasion is possible through abuse of fiscal regulations. The committee has not come to conclusion to say that MTN has evaded payment of taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Industry came here, made submission. MTN also made submission; they have claimed total capital allowances from inception to date up to N2.6 trillion. So the question we are asking Federal Ministry of Industry is to adduce records, evidence that they inspected their (MTN) assets based on which they issued the certificates, which MTN has taken to FIRS to secure tax rebate.\n\n\u201cIt is expected of the Federal Ministry of Industry to have inspected the assets before they issue the certificates. If the ministry is in default, then we might be thinking of collusion between the beneficiary of the certificate and Federal Ministry of Industry, which will amount to undermining Nigeria; which will amount to loss of revenue.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cWe also asked for proof, the dates because you cannot enter MTN premises without records. The assets claimed by MTN can be categorised into two: you have the local content and you have the foreign content. We have written Nigeria Customs to give us records of the imports, the assets imported by MTN and proof of duty payment. Because if they (MTN) don\u2019t pay the duty as expected, it also amounts to loss of revenue to the federation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Adamu begins tenure, pledges to continue party\u2019s winning ways in 2023\n\n\u2022Warns new committee members against disloyalty\n\nEmameh Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\nThe newly elected National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, yesterday received his staff of office from the outgoing Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja.\n\nBuni, in his handing over speech, congratulated APC\u2019s new national and zonal executives as well as President Muhammadu Buhari, who, according to him, provided the needed leadership and atmosphere for a rancour-free convention.\n\nThe governor, who had come under fire in the weeks before the convention, explained how his efforts in the last few months helped to reposition the party. However, he acknowledged there were still a lot to do to consolidate on the success recorded by the party under him.\n\nBuni stated, \u201cFirst, to sustain the gains and coming at a time when this party will soon start its nomination process, obviously the tasks before you are enormous.\n\n\u201cWe have done our best from the registration, to the congresses, the ward, local government, state and up to the convention. But that cannot be without problems here and there. By and large, we have succeeded.\n\n\u201cWe can say we have recorded 70 per cent success. A bigger and larger political party like APC with over 41 million memberships. Part of democracy is to agree and disagree at some points. But it is all about human management. The ability to manage the situation is what will keep this party together and stronger again, and again.\n\n\u201cSo, as it is and as members of NWC, you should study Mr. President\u2019s speech and that should be your guide. And also, I want to thank you, most importantly, for this opportunity, for all your efforts, both individually and collectively, for making our task easier throughout our stewardship.\u201d\n\nThe new national chairman of the party declared that his first task in office was to strategise with his team, both at national and zonal levels, on how to win the 2023 general election. Adamu noted that despite the successful outcome of the convention, enormous tasks remained ahead.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2018I want to say on behalf of the new NWC that it is not going to be an easy time for us. We have a major event that is going to test the water, but how stable are we as a party now that the general election is coming?\n\n\u201cFor me, by the time we start working, our main task will be how we handle the elections as a party. How will we win the general election? People are talking, saying the APC does not have an incumbent on the ticket.\n\n\u201cWe will have the honour and the integrity and the legacy of the current president on the ticket. We will work day and night. We have less than 12 months to face the general election. So, everybody should buckle up.\u201d\n\nAdamu promised to maintain APC\u2019s winning streak. He appealed for openness and cooperation from the NWC and other leadership structures of the party, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t begrudge me. If there is any issue, let me know.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI promise you, in the spirit of collective leadership, that team work is the only way. I cannot deliver alone. What I am asking for is something called \u2018loyalty,\u2019 you have to be loyal. We must have one team. If you bring a divisive tendency, we will deal with it.\n\n\u201cThis country is greater than any one of us. And this party is bigger than any single member of this party.\n\n\u201cPolitics is sometimes a job that should be done well. Ingratitude always accompanies whatever we do. But, what should keep you moving on is what you know you did in good faith. That which you know will give you desired results. This is the spirit with which we are going to work.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They said they don\u2019t want Tinubu or Osibanjo,\u201d a presidential source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported how the cabal had been pressuring Jonathan to defect to the APC.\n\nHe was said to have surprised the northern elite and the cabal by his disposition to the Buhari presidency despite all the dirt and campaign of calumny thrown at him and the PDP before the 2015 presidential election, which gave Buhari an unprecedented victory over an incumbent.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that some cabal members had also been impressed that despite the Buhari government's glaring failure, Jonathan had not openly criticised his predecessor or his administration, much unlike ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\n\nObasanjo had written open letters condemning the Buhari government and also verbally berated it at any opportunity.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from sources that the establishment of 'Almajiri' schools by Jonathan to reduce a large number of out-of-school children in the North also scored the former president good points in the eyes of the northern cabal in the APC, especially with most of it now rotting away, even under a northerner as president.",
          "summary": "The cabal, comprising some members of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s extended family and friends, are the powers behind the throne.\nSources told SaharaReporters that the former President rejected the conditions and told the cabal he doesn\u2019t have interest in the 2023 presidency again.\nHis response, it was gathered, embarrassed the cabal members who described the former President as a traitor.\nSaharaReporters had reported that members of the \u2018Aso Rock cabal\u2019 had promised Jonathan the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling APC.\n\u201cBuhari\u2019s cabal members have asked Jonathan to prepare for the party\u2019s ticket.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Ire Aderinokun is helping to shape Helicarrier's culture",
          "text": "The search for remote work has increased by 490% since the beginning of the pandemic. This means more companies, including big tech ones, have had to move their operations online.\n\nRemote work comes with its own advantages including a reduction in overhead costs with this Stanford report stating that companies can save between $2,000 to $11,000 per employee when they switch to remote work.\n\nIt also expands a company\u2019s reach and allows them to employ global talent, as well as expand to other regions and markets. In 2021, there were a number of product/market expansions on the continent that were fueled by raises and eased by remote work options. This includes Zuri Health\u2019s expansion into Senegal, MarketForce\u2019s entry into Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia, and even Mono\u2019s expansion into Ghana.\n\nRemote work, however, comes with its own disadvantages including decreased work/life balance, decreased employee visibility, a lack of team synergy, all of which can lead to harmful or stoic work culture.\n\nSo, how can founders, managers, and team leads build remote teams with healthy and sustainable cultures? How can companies manage distributed teams during their growth phase?\n\nIre Aderinokun, COO and VP, Engineering, at Helicarrier has a few answers. In the eighth episode of TechCabal\u2019s Building From Ground Up, Aderinokun speaks to TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and shares how she\u2019s helping Helicarrier manage its remote team.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Tomiwa Lasebikan and Ire Aderinokun, Helicarrier was originally Bitkoin Africa, a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading. Upon getting into Y Combinator in 2018, Bitkoin Africa morphed into BuyCoins with a number of product offerings including crypto trading. Last year, the trio created Helicarrier as the parent company to house all its products including BuyCoins, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and more.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, Ire Aderinokun, and Timi Ajiboye at Y Combinator in 2018\n\nWhile the team started with just 5 members, it quickly grew to 10 in its first year. Now, 5 years after launch, Helicarrier boasts of over 50 employees across 4 countries, all of whom are fully remote. So how does Aderinokun, whose office handles operations and staffing, manage her distributed team?\n\nUsing tools to build trust\n\nFor Aderinokun who studied psychology but ended up a software engineer, one of the most important ways Helicarrier has managed its remote team is by using no-code tools everyone can easily learn.\n\n\u201cWe rely a lot on the tools we use. Basecamp is our primary project management tool, and it allows us to keep track of what everyone is doing. But it also allows us to build trust,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nHelicarrier operates an asynchronous work structure. A synchronous work mode means that everyone is working simultaneously, and tasks or comments are responded to in real-time and without delay. It\u2019s the method employed by most companies globally. An asynchronous work structure, on the other hand, does not require all hands to work at the same time. This structure allows employees to maximise productivity by working when it best suits them, within reason of course.\n\n\u201cHaving an asynchronous work structure only really works when you have trust in the team, and enabling our team with tools has helped us do just that.\u201d\n\nFor a distributed remote team like Helicarrier\u2019s, asynchronous work also helps to address the difference in time zones. While most of Aderinokun\u2019s team is based in Lagos, Nigeria, a few are based in Ghana, Kenya, and even the UK.\n\n\u201cWe do have a working day, 10 AM to 5 PM and any team meetings we have are usually within this period. But we\u2019re not particular about when people get things done. If someone wants to do 4 hours of work in the middle of the night, that\u2019s fine with us. As long as you\u2019re achieving the set goals, you can work on your own time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aderinokun, Helicarrier also tries to be sensitive toward its employees\u2019 needs. The company pays its employees dollar stable coins and also pays for daily lunches and internet subscriptions.\n\n\u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto.\u201d\n\nSmall teams mean tighter bonds\n\nPaying salaries in crypto is not the only unconventional thing Helicarrier does.\n\nUpon hiring new team members, the company offers a one-month paid trial period that helps both employer and employee see if there\u2019s a culture fit. \u201cWith this method, they can see how we work and stay if they\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019ll also get to measure their skills up,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nOn building and maintaining company culture, Aderinokun states that most of the team members have direct relationships with 2 of the 3 co-founders.\n\n\u201cEven as we grow, one of the ways we install the company culture is by building direct relationships. So, everyone on the team works directly under one of the 3 co-founders. But we\u2019ve created a system where all team members can have a relationship with another co-founder they don\u2019t work under.\u201d\n\nBecause Helicarrier is still a small team of 50, its solution is feasible. As more team members get hired, though, Aderinokun believes that the team will have to find a sustainable method.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Andela expands its tech talent pool beyond software engineers",
          "text": "To date, Andela has helped companies build their remote engineering teams by giving them access to vetted software engineers from over 100 countries, counting among its clientele leading companies like GitHub, Goldman Sachs, and Cloudflare.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the global talent company said it is expanding its offering beyond engineering talent to include matching in new practice areas: specifically design, data, and product management.\n\n\u201cHaving worked across the continent and beyond, we know that the tech ecosystem does not just need only engineering talent,\u201d Agnes Muthoni, Director of the Andela Learning Community, said on the move. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that software engineers work entirely independently. It takes a variety of skill sets and expertise to make technical solutions that work.\u201d\n\nThe onboarding process for the new set of technical talent will be similar to Andela\u2019s existing model, consisting of English language and soft-skills assessments, technical assessments, and a portfolio review. But within the latter two, there will be some variance.\n\n\u201cWhere a software engineer will typically complete a coding challenge and peer code review, a designer may complete a project or do a portfolio walk-through and critique,\u201d Muthoni told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe expansion of Andela\u2019s offering coincides with the launch of its new platform for talent matching, which the company says is designed to create a \u201cmore direct and personalised hiring experience\u201d for both talent and recruiters.\n\nTill now, Andela has employed a hands-on matching process to help clients scale their technical team, which involves sifting through resumes and screening calls, and typically takes several weeks to complete.\n\nCompanies now have the option of using the self-service platform which, according to Andela, cuts down the hiring lifecycle for hiring managers and recruiters to as little as 48 hours.\n\n\u201cThe need to build scalable teams that can grow together when miles apart is increasingly apparent. Using the platform, hiring managers can find and hire their ideal candidate in two days or in less than two weeks, 70% faster than traditional in-house recruitment,\u201d Muthoni said.\n\nAndela\u2019s new website.\n\nHiring managers simply have to create a company profile, post a job, and can see curated and vetted candidates instantly. Talents can also see how well their skills match up to roles, with both parties having access to visualise compatibility, including overlap in skills and preferences.\n\n\u201cEach assessment and onboarding path gives a better indication of the kinds of teams they will be successful in,\u201d Muthoni said. \u201cTechnologists only need to test once instead of for each client or role, allowing hiring managers to focus on team fit instead of skills reviews. It simplifies the time commitment on both sides and increases the likelihood of a successful match.\u201d\n\nAccording to Andela, the matching accounts for depth and breadth of skill requirements, timezone and working hour overlaps, industry expertise, and team fit. In addition, the platform uses data-driven technology and algorithms to make smart match recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe Andela platform is constantly learning, helping to refine its personalised recommendations. As users accept or reject recommendations, they are also asked for specific feedback. With each bit of feedback, the platform becomes more personalised,\u201d the company explained in an official statement.\n\nWhen it comes to platforms, personalisation has become a \u201cbasic expectation\u201d, notes Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela.\n\n\u201cAmazon, Apple, and Netflix have changed every aspect of our lives\u2014from how we shop to how we consume culture and everything in between. This is why we\u2019ve built our new platform\u2014to help talent find jobs that match their technical skills and careers that match their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether Andela plans to phase out its initial model permanently, Muthoni noted that there will always be a need for a hands-on human-first matching process with the self-service platform launched only to give clients an option that helps them move through the recruitment cycle quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is Andela\u2019s clients can now choose their preferred service \u2013 the existing white-glove hands-on supported approach or rapid self-service through their new platform.\u201d\n\nAlongside its expanded offerings and new platform, Andela has also unveiled a new brand identity meant to \u201cbetter reflect the evolution of both the company as well as the global talent industry that it has helped to spawn.\u201d\n\nThese announcements come 6 months after Andela closed a $200 million Series E. The round\u2014led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, the venture capital arm of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank\u2014valued the company at $1.5 billion, cementing its place as one of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology.\n\nThrough its Andela Learning Community, it claims to have provided training and career opportunities for over 175,000 engineers globally at different stages of their careers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first talked to Damilola Kadiri, Wura Founder, early this year, my first thought was, \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\nWura is an item-sharing mobile app that enables you to give and receive used items from people either close to or far from you in Nigeria. These items could be clothes, books, shoes, jewellery, headphones, etc. Anything that is still useful and has value can be given out on the app.\n\nEarly last week, very late on Tuesday night, I talked to Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO Founder, after several scheduling mishaps.\n\nUsing a community-based model, GIVO uses technology to collect recyclable material from individuals, families, and businesses, which it turns into valuable goods. In 2020, the company produced personal protective equipment (PPE) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, although this is only one aspect of what the company does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, why did I talk to these two founders?\n\nThe global problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many people travelling by road into Lagos State, Nigeria, the first sight that greets them is the massive waste landfill at Ojota. The site has become quite iconic, and not in a good way; it stinks to high heaven and probably constitutes some sort of biohazard.\n\nIt serves as one of the dumping grounds for all waste trucks in the state. However, despite the government\u2019s best efforts, Lagos still has a waste problem, as evidenced by the informal dumping grounds \u2014 also known as gutters and canals \u2014 that constitute the waste disposal mechanism for many residents.\n\nBut this is not just a Lagos or a Nigerian problem. It is not even an African problem. It is way bigger; it is a global issue.\n\nEvery year, the earth\u2019s inhabitants produce 2.1 billion tonnes of waste, only 16% of which is recycled. On a positive note, 700 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions are prevented from entering the atmosphere.\n\nBut, one little \u2014 more like humongous \u2014 challenge exists: the world\u2019s population keeps growing at an alarming rate. Africa is expected to reach nearly 2.5 billion people by 2050. At the moment, the continent is reportedly home to 1.3 billion people.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: as the population grows, waste grows, and global waste is expected to grow by 70% by 2050.\n\nEssentially, a 16% recycling rate doesn\u2019t begin to cut it; there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWura\u2019s value proposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKadiri launched Wura \u2014 meaning gold in the Yoruba language \u2014 in November 2021. Available on Google Play Store and the Apple App store, it enables users to give and receive used items for free. Wura is a product of Kadiri\u2019s increasing interest in sustainability and saving the environment, but also his need to help people by changing their behaviour towards the planet.\n\nSince launch, the app has seen 354 users sign up and 47 items given out.\n\nThe cycle of giving and receiving involves signing up as a user on the platform. So, while a person can view all the different items available on the app, they won\u2019t be able to give or receive anything without signing up and creating an account.\n\nOne interesting bit about the app is that a person looking to receive does not pay any money for the item. There is a set of Golden Rules to prevent anything untoward from happening. Users are urged to only receive items from people with a profile picture and report a giver who insists on collecting money from them.\n\nImage: Screenshot of Golden Rules\n\nThe idea is to prevent people from throwing out perfectly good items with good reusable value, thereby reducing generated waste. There are also plans to introduce the option of giving away food, but cultural issues surrounding receiving food from strangers stand as a barrier to that.\n\nThe app also shows you how your actions affect the environment whenever you give or receive.\n\nImage: Screenshot of Impact Made\n\nAs Kadiri told me, there are no plans to commercialise the app for the next three to four years. A surprising decision if you ask me, but he has his reasons.\n\n\u201cFor now, we are looking at increasing the number of transactions on the app and sign-ups, then over time, what we intend to do is promote sustainability businesses. So I feel that would be an avenue for us to generate profit. As I said, the idea is to change people\u2019s behaviour to be eco-friendly.\n\n\u201cAnyone who comes around the app most likely has that attitude already. With that now, we know that the adverts or the promos on our platform are strictly eco-friendly products.\u201d\n\nEssentially, as people use Wura and begin to see how their actions help protect the planet by reducing CO2 emissions when they don\u2019t just throw things away, their attitudes should change.\n\nChanging attitudes lead to more interest in protecting the environment and, in turn, more interest in businesses that promote sustainability.\n\nAmbitious? Definitely. Doable? Maybe. It would be interesting to see how this works eventually.\n\nGIVO\u2019s circular economy\n\nGIVO or Garbage In, Value Out was birthed from Victor Boyle-Komolafe and the Capture Solution\u2019s team\u2019s participation in the Entrepreneurs Plastics Innovation Challenge (EPIC) sponsored by Coca-Cola and the HYBR Group in 2018.\n\nEPIC is an innovation challenge aimed at identifying solutions to eliminate plastic waste in Nigeria by sourcing sustainable solutions to identify, develop, and scale potential circular innovations from entrepreneurs, wherever they may be.\n\nBoyle-Komolafe describes GIVO as a technology company and not particularly a recycling company.\n\n\u201cWe came into this space as techies. We want to save the environment, but we also want to scale.\u201d\n\nNothing typifies the company\u2019s decision more than its partnership with the University of Warwick, UK, De Montfort University, and Chatham House as they research the best way to scale sustainability businesses.\n\nWhat does GIVO do?\n\nAs a business, GIVO has two main value propositions: manufacturer and collector. As a manufacturer, the company makes plastic sheets from recyclables that they can then sell to people in the construction and furniture industry. But, Boyle-Komolafe believes it is not as scalable as other aspects of the business.\n\nAs a collector, GIVO establishes women/youth-led community centres that collect waste within a 2-3 kilometre radius; a deliberate decision, he explains.\n\n\u201cIn a 2-kilometre radius, there will always be recyclables. So you know that you have a consistent market share.\u201d\n\nFrom collection to sorting to shredding, the entire process is digitised using the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile apps, and 2D scanners. Currently, there are two GIVO centres in Nigeria, with plans to launch three more before the end of the first quarter of 2022. According to Boyle-Komolafe, each centre collects 90 tonnes a year. There are also plans to franchise the centres next year, with GIVO collecting a percentage of the revenue.\n\nBut he also mentions that collection is incentive-driven.\n\nFrom the GIVO centres, the company also collates a lot of data which it can then sell as aggregate data to the government or companies for several uses.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government has limited resources, and you\u2019re trying to plan for the next cancer centre or a liver care centre. All that needs to be done is to go through our database and see the GIVO centre collecting the most alcoholic drink or receiving the most alcoholic drinks with no bar or a restaurant as a major client.\u201d\n\nData like that would provide information about where there might be an outbreak of liver-related diseases and inform government decisions. He also says companies can use it to determine the success of advertising campaigns in specific areas.\n\nCelebrating recycling heroes\n\nBoth Kadiri and Boyle-Komolafe see the recycling game as a long-term business. It requires careful planning and execution to ensure the initial goal of sustainability is not lost.\n\nThe process starts with educating people and, in GIVO\u2019s case, incentivising them to understand the circular economy of buy-reuse/recycle-buy.\n\nThe work ahead is still very tedious and long but also rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

In the third quarter of 2021, Samsung had the highest market share \u2014 20% \u2014 of the global smartphone market, followed by Apple and Xiaomi.\n\nHowever, the smartphone giant might have been exaggerating the performance capabilities of its phones. On March 7, 2022, Korea Herald, a Korean news outlet, reported that Samsung was being accused of exaggerating the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S22.\n\nBefore iPhone users think they have something to lord over Android users, tech YouTuber, Arun Maini, popularly known as Mrwhosetheboss, explained on Wednesday, March 30 2022, that even Apple has run into such troubles before, slowing down the phone\u2019s speed to make up for weak batteries.\n\nThe truth, however, is that Samsung phones are capable of the performance advertised, but the manufacturer doesn\u2019t let them reach such speeds because it will kill the phone\u2019s battery. This means that while the phone\u2019s chip can enable such speeds the phone cannot support it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee it as building a car with a powerful engine but with a plastic body. The carmaker tells you to buy a shiny new car because it\u2019s faster. But, there\u2019s a device hidden in the car that doesn\u2019t let you reach the top speed because the car will break apart under heavy wind pressure. While your new car has a bigger engine you\u2019re only allowed to go as fast as your old car.\n\nThe hidden device in the phones is called a game optimizing service (GOS). It limits the phone\u2019s speed when running apps but lets it run to the highest when you try to measure the phone\u2019s speed with a benchmark app like AnTuTu.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nUSSD vs bank apps\n\nUnderstanding startup funding rounds\n\nPay TV prices\n\nStax\u2019s USSD upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax mobile app\n\nEven though I dread money leaving my bank account, it is an inevitable reality I must accept. From satisfying cravings to paying for rides or just helping out a friend, I\u2019ve learned to live with the terrifying debit alerts that accompany bank transfers.\n\nI made bank transfers with Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes for a long time. When I switched to bank apps, I stuck to it because it was easier than USSD.\n\nHowever, a significant amount of transactions are still done through USSD. According to Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), nine out of ten transactions are done with USSD.\n\nWhy\u2019s USSD preferable? Simple answer: it works offline and doesn\u2019t need a smartphone. While offline transactions don\u2019t need an Internet connection, dealing with session timeouts and multiple menus is not a pleasing user experience.\n\nEnter Stax: Stax brings the USSD experience to an offline mobile app; it\u2019s like a bank app but works with USSD. CEO and Co-Founder of Stax, Ben Lyon, said the best part of USSD is that it works offline. On the opposing end, however, is its awful user experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUSSD has been in existence for 24 years with minimal disruption, but Stax wants to innovate around it with plans to add crypto services.\n\nCurious as to how Stax hopes to do this? Look out for my article that details how USSD works, why it has worked the same way for over a decade, and how Stax is working on an upgrade, tomorrow.\n\nUnderstanding startup funding rounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese days, it seems like the success of a startup is determined by how much funding it has raised. For many people I\u2019ve met who long to be startup founders, the ultimate dream is to close Flutterwave-level funding.\n\nFunding is essential: Starting a business is an arduous task, and entrepreneurs need all the help they can get. Before startup funding became a thing, getting a loan or saving up was the way to start and grow a business.\n\nBut with VC funding, access to funding increased. Startups were able to grow exponentially within a short period, and with the number of successes recorded by African startups, VCs poured in approximately $5 billion in funding last year.\n\nFrom pre-seed rounds to Series As and the unusual Series A2, what exactly do funding rounds mean?\n\nWell, if you\u2019re an aspiring founder like Chimgozirim (who plans to use his seed funding to pay for his wedding), then you need to read his: The complete guide to startup funding rounds\n\n\u201cWhat DStv Nigeria is doing here, they can\u2019t do it in many countries.\u201d \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s Senate President, Ahmed Lawan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDStv dish. Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nThe Nigerian Senate has ordered pay TV service providers to reduce their prices and move from a fixed payment subscription model to a pay-per-view model that allows users to pay for only what they watch.\n\nAccording to Nairametrics, the order was given during a plenary session on Wednesday, March 30, 2022.\n\nMultiChoice Nigeria, owners of entertainment services, DStv and GOtv, is first in line on the Senate\u2019s naughty list of pay TV services.\n\nThe Senate called out MultiChoice for \u201c willfully and perpetually increasing the cost of its bundles because there is no regulation whatsoever in the area of fixing rates.\u201d\n\nThis is coming after MultiChoice increased its subscription rates, which will take effect from April 1, 2022. The pay TV company cited the rising cost of operation as the reason for the price hike.\n\nInflation on a bull run: According to Trade Economics, Nigeria\u2019s annual inflation rate climbed to 15.7% in February 2022 as fuel shortages caused the price of commodities to go up. However, inflation in the country has dropped from a high of 18.17% in April last year.\n\nNot the first rodeo: This isn\u2019t the first time MultiChoice is getting on the bad side of the Nigerian authorities. In July 2021, the Federal Inland Revenue Service directed some commercial banks to freeze and recover \u20a61.8 trillion ($4.4 billion) from MultiChoice.\n\nFor more on that, you can revisit: Nigeria\u2019s tax authority queries MultiChoice over possible \u20a61.8 trillion tax fraud.

The Techpoint Africa Podcast, that\u2019s what.\n\nIf you are an avid listener, then you\u2019ve probably not missed the last three episodes where we\u2019ve discussed everything from hope as a service to why there seems to be a lot of white founders in Kenya. You can catch up on all of that here, with links to all your favourite streaming platforms.\n\nThis week\u2019s podcast takes you on a continental tour, beginning with Nigeria, going on to Kenya, and then Sudan and Uganda.\n\nFirst on the list is the recent news of the Kogi Internal Revenue Service (KIRS) sealing 70 telecom base stations, including hub sites that serve as connecting points for other states. From what we\u2019ve learned so far, the KIRS believes it is owed certain levies and dues by telecom companies and has received a court order legitimising its actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important, though? Turns out this could lead to a telecommunications blackout, not just in Kogi State \u2014 a state in Nigeria\u2019s North Central region \u2014 but in nine other states bordering Kogi, including Abuja, Nasarawa, and Ondo.\n\nThere was quite a bit to unpack here, ranging from states and their penchant for interesting policies to enabling business environments \u2014 which appear to be the very last thing on the states\u2019 minds. We also found an interesting titbit that put everything in perspective, which you can find here.\n\nFun fact: In 2021, Kogi State generated \u20a623,266,375,259 ($56 million) internally. This is almost double the amount it received from Nigeria\u2019s federal government.\n\nMoving on from Kogi State and its internally generated revenue drama is the news of Meta (formally Facebook) and Kenya\u2019s August 2022 elections.\n\nTo enhance transparency in political advertising, Meta is introducing its transparency tool for electoral and issue ads that will provide more information about political advertising on Facebook and Instagram ahead of the elections.\n\nEssentially, the ads will have a \u201cpaid for by\u2026\u201d banner and be stored on Meta\u2019s Ad Library for seven years.\n\nAnother fun fact: Meta introduced this tool in Nigeria\u2019s 2019 elections.\n\nBut Emmanuel Paul believes there\u2019s a big picture here that needs to be examined. \u201cI\u2019m just seeing a dystopian future and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so pessimistic,\u201d he says\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig tech seems to be getting bigger and bigger every day. He argues that Meta\u2019s decision could have other implications we might not be seeing, like bias or possible influence on elections. But not everyone agrees with him. We had an interesting discussion during the podcast, which nicely segued into our last story: Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) unusual interest in certain African countries.\n\nThis year\u2019s YC Demo Day was held from March 29 to March 30, 2022, with Nigeria topping the list of countries after the US and India. But that\u2019s not the story here.\n\nThis year\u2019s batch includes African countries like Sudan, Uganda. Interestingly this is not the first time YC is investing in startups outside the Big Four as we saw with Senegal\u2019s Wave, but it is indicative of a growing interest in East and North Africa.\n\nOn the face of it, that appears to be a good thing. A startup getting into YC is one of the greatest validators there is. But this also raises the question of the supposed silence of the local investment scene in these countries and the long-term effects this could have on the economy.\n\nThe circular nature of Africa\u2019s economic problems also play a role here as well. For example, with increasing forex sourcing problems, Nigerian banks have reduced dollar spending limits on naira debit cards.\n\nWe discussed all of this and more, including ways for you to circumvent the current dollar spending limits.

          "text": "More than three years after its commencement, the Micro Pension Plan (MPP) is yet to gain traction as players in the Nigerian pension industry have continued to struggle to understand the customers.\n\nIndustry players who believe the scheme should be embraced because of its sustainable retirement gains said getting to understand the needs and behaviour of the customers had been a challenge.\n\nThe MPP was designed for the informal sector, such as the self-employed or organisations that cannot participate in the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) because they do not have a minimum of three employees as specified in the Pension Reform Act 2014. They include small-scale business owners, petty traders, artisans, and entrepreneurs.\n\nAccording to the National Pension Commission (PenCom), only 73,600 contributors have been enrolled into the micro pension plan as at December 31, 2021.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, 19 Pension Fund Administrators registered 2,166 MPP contributors.\n\nThe sum of N25,094,874.26 was credited into the Retirement Savings Accounts of 8,260 MPP contributors in Q4, bringing the total value of the micro pension funds to N224,054,870.69 at end of the quarter.\n\nWale Odutola, president of Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria, in an interview with BusinessDay, said the micro pension space offered significant room for growth because of the large number of Nigerians in the informal sector.\n\nOdutola, who is also the MD/CEO of ARM Pensions, however said the scheme had not picked up as anticipated, as the pension industry \u201cis still trying to understand the needs and behaviours of those in that sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found out that many of the people in the informal sector still have apathy towards formal savings and investment schemes because of past failures. We have also realised that we all need to reduce our costs to serve this segment for it to make commercial sense,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said operators had also realised the need to incentivise the sector with some form of immediate benefits.\n\n\u201cThese are some issues we have noticed, and the operators and the commission are working together to increase penetration in the micro pension space,\u201d Odutola said.\n\nEFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria, in a 2020 survey published in November 2021, titled \u2018Pension and financial inclusion,\u2019 said increased uptake or usage of pension was needed to achieve the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) targets and improve livelihoods for Nigerians.\n\nRead also: Premium Pension Assets under management grows by 12.34% to N885bn\n\nAccording to the report, NFIS target is to increase the adult population covered by a regulated pension scheme to 40 percent by 2020, and as at the end of that year, only about 7 percent have pensions, including 1.8 million micro pension holders.\n\nThe report shows that 98 percent, that is 48.7 million individuals working in the informal sector, are without pensions, most receive income from their own businesses and earn N35,000 and below per month, while 95 percent receive their income in cash.\n\nA further breakdown of the data show that from this population, 27 percent earn below N15,000; 26 percent earn N15,001 -N35,000; 11 percent N35,001 -N55,000; 7 percent earn above N55,000, while the remaining 29 percent are neutral.\n\nIn trying to understand the character of the population, the report revealed 51.5 percent of them want to make savings themselves; 48 percent hope to rely on their children at old age, 41 percent own their own businesses, while 15.6 are crop and livestock farmers.\n\n\u201cMost informal sector workers plan to rely on their savings, children or businesses in retirement; irregular income and not having enough money are the most frequent reasons given for not making regular retirement contributions. This indicates that pension products with flexible contribution and timing could be useful in reaching those without pensions,\u201d the report said.\n\nHowever, beyond low income, awareness and confidence constraints, other supply side challenges further hinders uptake of micro pension products in Nigeria.\n\nEFInA recommends increased value proposition of pension, including expanding the use-cases to meet critical developmental goals as well as bundled services.\n\nIt stressed the need for \u201cconcerted industry-wide effort to leverage technology, particularly in tackling the infrastructural and cost barriers in serving the target group; regulation for innovation, that is open the market for a range of innovative providers, business models and solutions that have the potential to expand pension coverage in Nigeria while protecting against key risks.\u201d\n\nOthers are promotion of micro pensions and protections put in place for pension holders, and leveraging non-traditional financial access points in driving awareness, educating the populace and building trust among the low-income populations.\n\nHowever, while the micro pension scheme is dragging, the CPS, meant for the formal sector, is making some progress, with about 9.5 million registered contributors from about 80 million workforce.\n\nIndustry stakeholders have emphasised the need for more awareness to grow both schemes.\n\nSimi Ojumu, head of equities and fixed income sales at Absa Nigeria, told BusinessDay in an interview that there was a need for massive awareness on the implications of partial and non-compliance with the PRA 2014 by private employers, state governments and the Federal Government.\n\nWhile she believes that compliance in the formal sector would largely influence the micro pension plan in the informal sector, she said, \u201cIt is uncharitable for any state government or any employer of labour, be it in the public or private sector, to delay enrolling their workers in the new pension scheme.\u201d\n\nThere is also a need for stricter enforcement to ensure that state governments and private employers remit pension deductions to workers\u2019 PFAs, she said.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for PenCom to engage the critical stakeholders \u2013 state Houses of Assembly, National Assembly, and the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria to drive compliance in enrolment and remittances,\u201d she added.\n\nAs part of efforts to create awareness, PenCom, in the last quarter of last year, participated at the 2021 Lagos International Trade Fair organised by the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in collaboration with the Lagos State Government.\n\nAccording to the commission, the fair provided the opportunity to sensitise members of the public on the workings of the MPP as well as respond to other inquiries on the CPS.\n\nIt also facilitated a workshop on the MPP for Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association and Association of Progressive Traders of Nigeria, as well as participated at the 8th Kwara State Trade Fair, taking advantage of the event to engage with self-employed individuals and small business owners on the MPP.",

Oredo Local Council he said had withheld over N120 million in deduction of monies belonging to the workers\u2019 Cooperative Society. He however did not state how much the managements of other councils were owing.\n\nFilani Ojo said that the respective Managements in the local government councils and the AAU had over the years formed the dagerous habbits of only the net salaries of workers in their employ at the expense of their gross earnings where all the workers\u2019 financial commitments to the various cooperative societies and unions are contained.\n\nMr Ojo whose views were coroborated by the presidents of the cooperative societies in Oredo, Etsako West, Owan East local councils and the AAU, noted that all efforts by the leadership of the Federation through regular Interface with the Managements of the affected councils and institution to remit the deductions and stop further withholding of the workers\u2019 life long savings had not yielded any positive results as promises made to the workers\u2019 in the past by Managements we\u2019re not respected.\n\nHe said the unhealthy development has crippled the activities of the cooperative societies and make them inable to meet their financial obligations to contributors of the funds.\n\n\u201cWe are pained each time members in need especially those with one health challenge or the other apply for loans or have retired and want their money and we are not able to pay them.\n\n\u201d This is the most painful aspects of the matter because workers who are not members of the Cooperatives societies and are not also financially committed anywhere, get their salaries in full\u201d, Kilani emphasized.\n\nWhat this points to is that there is a deliberate attempts to cripple cooperative societies in the state and thereby deny the contributors the opportunity to reap the benefits of\u2019 their savings as well as kill the culture of savings which is at the core of any business development.\n\nThey however appealed to the state Governor, Goodwin Obaseki to intervene and save the cooperative societies from the stranglehold of those withholding their deducted funds to remit same so that the poor contributors can have access to their life savings which they hoped to fall back on while waiting for their retirement benefits or for other uses.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

As operational officers, you have the intel in terms of what has to be done, but I\u2019m constrained as the deputy speaker to continue the meeting because the accounting officers are the ones that are supposed to be here while you give them the necessary support,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am saying with a heavy heart. No matter the assignment our generals are handling, I believe the parliament requires a listening ear. This is the house of the people. I am not happy expressing my disappointment.\n\n\u201cIn all the agencies, none of all the chief executives that were invited came. Maybe we are considered to be jokers, but we are not jokers.\u201d\n\nAbel Enitan, permanent secretary of the ministry of aviation, said Sirika is currently abroad on an official assignment with the knowledge of the president.\n\nResponding, Wase said: \u201cDon\u2019t use the name of Mr President. This institution is not under the presidency; it is an institution of its own.\u201d\n\nO.T. Akinjobi, a representative of the minister of defence, said his boss was in a meeting summoned by the president over the attack.\n\n\u201dThe expeditious nature of the assignment demanded that they hold the meeting immediately and they have been in session since last night up to this time,\u201d he added.\n\nBut unsatisfied, Wase described the reason as an excuse.\n\n\u201cAll these are excuses as far as I am concerned. The situation is like blackmail to the government. We are losing the only pride that we can showcase \u2014 that critical infrastructure that is about to be destroyed is one of the legacies of this administration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a parliament, we have cooperated to ensure the safety of our people. So, these are excuses that are not taken by the parliament.\u201d\n\nA representative of FAAN said the director-general is expected back in the country on Thursday from the US, TheCable reported.\n\nOn his part, Sanusi Lemu, deputy inspector-general of police in charge of finance and administration who represented the IGP, said his boss respects the parliament which is why he sent a representative.\n\n\u201dIt is in Nigerian parliament that you summon accounting officers that they won\u2019t come. It doesn\u2019t happen in other democratic climes. It is not a favour done to us. If they are here, they are here to give an account of what they are responsible for. And here is the only place they can render a proper account,\u201d Wase responded.\n\n\u201cThe crafters of the constitution know the reason why they put us to do the scrutiny oversight. The president doesn\u2019t have that time. We are the ones to ask questions and our questions must be answered. It is an aberration.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin to do the right thing. This country belongs to us. If there is synergy in operation, this thing would not happen.\u201d",

We are aware that cases are rising in the Western Pacific and Eastern Europe. The US just mandated a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine for adults older than 50. We fear a reversal of the pandemic situation, where largely unvaccinated poor countries will be made to bear the burden, because the West has developed very high immunity through large scale vaccination.\n\n\u201cOur biggest fear now is the upcoming Easter holidays. If we are able to cross and the cases continue to go down with no significant increase in hospitalisation and death, then certainly, we will lower down our level of alertness and relax most of the measures.\n\n\u201cWe are working with data and algorithms to determine our line of action. Everything depends on what happens next. We learn from other countries, but we don\u2019t have to necessarily copy what they are doing. Every country should evaluate its risk and take responsibility.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, data from the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency has revealed that a total of 12,139,797 persons have been fully vaccinated in Nigeria, while 18,942,020 persons have been partially vaccinated.",

          "text": "The embattled former Commander, Intelligence Response Team, Abba Kyari, has rejected food offered him by the Nigerian Correctional Service after being remanded in prison custody on Monday.\n\nThe suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, it was learnt, opted for the food prepared by his wife or other family members.\n\nAccording to a report by Punch, Kyari\u2019s presence has generated some excitement among the inmates, some of who were investigated for various crimes by the IRT under the DCP.\n\nAn officer stated, \u201cWe suspected that he may not eat the food being served here. So, we were not surprised when he opted for the food prepared by his wife or family members.\n\n\u201cHis presence has, however, generated excitement in the facility. Many inmates who had had some encounters with him and others who heard about his ongoing trial have been discussing the fact that a senior policeman like him was remanded in Kuje where some individuals he investigated are also serving time.\u201d\n\nThe NCoS spokesman, Francis Enobore, said inmates facing prosecution had the right to eat food prepared by their family members, noting that they are free to provide their food by themselves.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOur law allows us to request any inmate who wishes to do self-feeding to apply through a formal application to the officer in-charge of the custodial centre. Subject to the approval of the official in-charge, the applicant will make arrangements with whoever he wishes to bring food for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe caveat is that if the person fails to bring food, he would not be fed from the service\u2019s kitchen. Again, whoever is bringing his food; it is compulsory the person tastes the food in the presence of the officer conducting the visit to ensure that the food is wholesome before passing it over to the inmate.\u201d\n\nEnobore explained that no alcohol drink or cigarettes are allowed in the correctional centres, adding that 12 officers were facing sanctions for breaching the law on trafficking of illegal materials into the facility.\n\n\u201cNo alcoholic drink or cigarette is allowed in the facility.

          "text": "Ahead of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primaries, former Senate President and presidential aspirant, Dr. Bukola Saraki has urged Nigerians to elect a president for the country based on competence and not on religion and ethnicity, adding that he is the most qualified for the job.\n\nSaraki, a former governor of Kwara State, stated this in Benin City when he paid a visit to PDP delegates in Edo State to solicit their support.\n\nRepresented by the Chairman, Contact and Advocacy Council, Bukola Saraki Presidential Campaign Organisation, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher, Saraki said though Nigerians had been using ethnic and religion in choosing leaders of the country, he was a man with no ethnic or religion bias.\n\nOther members of the Abubakar Bukola Saraki Contact and Advocacy Council are: Dr. Ahmadu Musa, Secretary;\n\nAlhaji Aliyu Maigari, Senator Shaaba Lafiagi, Hassan Husseini MNI and Prince Oleteru Lekan.\n\nAlso in the team were, Dr. Cletus Akwaya, Judith Bindi and David Itopa, as well as Moses Aliyu.\n\nSaraki stressed that he stands tall and remained the most competent and qualified aspirant among others.\n\nAccording to him, the problem of Nigeria was not resources but lack of good leadership.\n\n\u201cNigeria has refused to identify the right man and put him in a leadership position. We choose our leaders based on religion; we choose leaders based on zoning; we choose our leaders based on identity politics. Nigeria is a diverse society.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to use this parameters in choosing our leaders, especially the position of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Therefore, he is offering himself as the president that the whole Nigeria will identify with.\u201d\n\nHagher who disclosed that Saraki has promised women 35 per cent representation in leadership position if elected as president, adding that his principal would make youths below 35 years of age to be minister in all the ministries.\n\nHagher who stated that his principal was committed to rescuing Nigeria from the major crisis the All Progressives Congress had plunged the nation into, lamented that, \u201cNigeria is in the emergency ward. Nigeria is sick. And if the country is sick, then it needs a medical doctor to attend to it, a man that will fix Nigeria by setting it back on it fit.\n\n\u201cWhen the PDP came to power, we offset all debt, but within seven years of the APC coming into power, we have been plunged into debt.

          "text": "The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), a global organisation unifying the mobile ecosystem for societal change on Wednesday released its 10th annual \u201cState of the Industry Report on Mobile Money.\u201d\n\nThe report released during a webinar, revealed that global mobile money adoption and use witnessed growth in 2021, processing a record $1 trillion annually.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAccording to the report, the milestone figure was a sign of strong industry growth, as accounts, value and volume of transactions all soared.\n\n\u201cThe industry enjoyed a substantial increase in the number of registered accounts, up 18 per cent since 2020, reaching 1.35 billion globally. The volume of person-to-person transactions were up to more than 1.5 million every hour,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt further revealed that one of the most significant drivers of growth was merchant payment, which almost doubled year-on-year. It also highlighted how mobile money continued to act as a core pillar of financial and economic inclusion, particularly for women.\n\nWhile presenting the report, Head of Financial Inclusion and AgriTech at GSMA, Ashley Olson Onyango, stated that mobile money had become an enabler of different services across sectors, solving critical, social, economic and environmental challenges, by providing access to essential utilities.\n\nAnalysing the report during the webinar session, Executive at MTN Group and Head of Fintech Payment/Digital Channel/Strategy, Mr. Cedric NGuessan, explained how diversification helped in growing the mobile money ecosystem by expanding the merchant networks, after an elaborate expansion of the consumer market.\n\nGiving an insight into the significant growth in merchant payments, the report said, \u201cMobile money diversified its value proposition beyond person-to-person transfers and cash-in/cash-out transactions in 2021. It is now playing an important role in the daily lives of people and businesses, especially in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\u201cThe growth of ecosystem transactions, such as merchant payments, international remittances, bill payments, and bulk disbursements, together with interoperable transactions, are accounting for a more significant share of the global mobile money transaction mix.\u201d\n\nThe report said merchant payments were instrumental to the growth of the mobile money industry in 2021. The value of merchant payments almost doubled, reaching an average of $5.5 billion in transactions per month.\n\nThe report added, \u201cProviders are demonstrating that they can attract businesses to their platform with better incentives, such as efficient remote onboarding processes. For example, since Safaricom\u2019s M-PESA began allowing companies to register for an account online in Kenya, more than 18 per cent of new merchants are self-onboarding.\u201d\n\nHead of Mobile for Development at GSMA, Max Cuvellier, stated, \u201c2021 was the year mobile money started to really diversify into Business-to-Business (B2B) services. Beyond traditional person-to-person transactions, such as transferring money to family or friends, the industry is now central in helping small businesses operate more efficiently, and serve their customers better.\u201d\n\nIn the area of increasing financial inclusion for women, the report noted, \u201cMobile money has also been a driving force for financial inclusion for the world\u2019s most vulnerable, particularly women. Mobile money is empowering women to take more control over their finances and purchase goods that they urgently need.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, 44 per cent of providers responding to the GSMA Global Adoption Survey now offer credit, savings or insurance products, creating opportunities for underserved individuals to invest in their livelihoods and futures.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, with the gender gap in mobile money account ownership ranging from seven per cent in Kenya, to 71 per cent in Pakistan, there remain some barriers to vulnerable people benefitting from mobile money.\n\nThe report said, \u201cOwning a mobile phone is an obvious pre-requisite to using mobile money, and women across low and medium income countries are seven per cent less likely than men to own a mobile phone.\n\n\u201cOverall, 143 million fewer women own a mobile than men. Additional barriers to mobile money access include a lack of awareness of mobile money and a deficit in perceived relevance, knowledge and skills.\u201d\n\nWhile some progress has been made, the report made it clear that more must be done to address the mobile money gender gap across low and medium income countries.\n\nThe report further stated that concerted action would be required from policymakers, the private sector, donors and other stakeholders to learn from success stories, address the issue, and ensure that existing gender inequalities are not further entrenched, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
