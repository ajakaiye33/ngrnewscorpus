          "title": "Petroleum Industry Act: States tackle FG today as FAAC meets, NBA advises governors",
          "text": "\u2022 We\u2019ll review the law at FAAC today and disclose our position \u2013 Benue commissioner\n\n\u2022 Challenge Petroleum Industry Act in court, NBA, Ozekhome tell state governments\n\nThe 36 state governments will today (Thursday) at the Federation Account and Allocation Committee meeting review the Petroleum Industry Bill, which was signed into law on Monday by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nA top official of the Federal Ministry of Finance, who confided in one of our correspondents on Wednesday, said the state governments had put the ministry on notice that they would state their grievances with the Petroleum Industry Act at the FAAC meeting.\n\nAhead of the FAAC meeting, the Nigerian Bar Association advised the state governors to challenge the Act in court.\n\nThe FAAC consists of the Minister of Finance as chairman, all state commissioners of Finance, state accountants-general, Accountant-General of the Federation and the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Finance, who is the secretary.\n\nIt meets monthly to share revenues among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThere was a report on Wednesday that before the President signed the PIB, state governors had on August 10 written to ask him to withhold his assent.\n\nAccording to the report, the governors argued that the Petroleum Industry Act would deny the states their fair share from the Federation Account because it favoured the Federal Government and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which would transform into a limited liability company.\n\nOn Wednesday, a state official, who spoke to one of our correspondents, stated, \u201cThe governors have directed their commissioners for finance to get a copy of the Act signed by the President. Obviously, the law will top the agenda of the FAAC meeting on Thursday (today).\n\n\u201cState commissioners will raise the misgiving the states have about the law at the FAAC meeting and take a common position.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Chairman, Forum of Commissioners of Finance, David Olofu, said members would meet and review the PIA.\n\nOlofu, who is Benue State\u2019s Commissioner for Finance, who spoke to one of our correspondents in Makurdi on the phone, confirmed that the FAAC meeting would be held today (Thursday).\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am still trying to get to the crux of the Act so that I can review it; it is after I review it that I can make a statement. We are having the FAAC meeting tomorrow (Thursday); we will get the law and review it and then get back to you.\u201d\n\nChallenge PIA in court, NBA advises govs\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association, Rapulu Nduka, in an interview with The PUNCH, noted that people in different parts of the country had been making comments on the provisions of the PIA, adding that some of them were feeling short-changed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cLawmaking is one of the responsibilities of the legislature and since there are legislators from all states of the federation, then there should be proper representation.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of having legislators from all states is that they should be able to debate laws before they are passed in order to ensure that those laws are made in the interest of every region.\n\n\u201cIf the governors believe that some parts of the Act are unconstitutional, then by all means, let them approach the courts. They should go to court to challenge the aspects, which they believe are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nAlso, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Babatunde Ogala, stated, \u201cThis is a law that has been in the works for a very long time. We are not oblivious to the reservations of different commentators and groups, especially in the South-South.\n\n\u201cI believe it is a step in the right direction since we now have three per cent, where we once had nothing. However, the Act can still be amended if it proves to be unsatisfactory.\u201d\n\nOzekhome urges states to approach Supreme Court\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome, on Wednesday, called on state attorneys general to challenge the Federal Government on the PIA.\n\nOzekhome, in an interview with The PUNCH, faulted the decision of the President to sign the law and called on state attorneys general to challenge the Federal Government at the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe entire Act is a mere ruse in monstrosity, artifice and design, carefully crafted, incubated and delivered to actually do irretrievable violence to the principles of federalism and the doctrine of separation of powers ably propounded in 1748 by Baron de Montesquieu, a great French philosopher.\n\n\u201cThe Act seeks to frontally attack Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution, which provides that all revenues accruing to the federation shall be paid into a Federation Account from which sharing shall be made among the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cThis is unconstitutional and it must be struck down in accordance with Section 1(3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria. In a sane clime, the cash cow, the NNPC, ought to be unbundled to make it more productive, transparent and accountable to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cBut most curiously, the Act has strengthened its hand of non-accountability and non-responsibility.\n\n\u201cHow can the Federal Government alone have shares in the only viable cash cow of Nigeria to the total exclusion of the other three tiers of government, major stakeholders, oil-bearing communities and the long-suffering people of the Niger Delta?\n\n\u201cHow can an Act of Parliament, rather than assuage and ameliorate the sufferings of a beleaguered people, further compound them by reaffirming the people\u2019s perilous status as slavish hewers of wood, drawers of water, masseurs of ego and side-line onlookers in the exploitation and use of their God- given wealth through their natural resources?\n\n\u201cThe 36 state attorneys general should immediately approach the Supreme Court and challenge the Federal Government\u2019s impunity and the act of exclusive lawlessness and legislative rascality by invoking the original jurisdiction under Section 233 (1) of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nHow 9th N\u2019Assembly passed PIB \u2013 Lawan\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Wednesday gave an insight into what the National Assembly did to get the PIB.\n\nLawan disclosed the strategy adopted by the 9th National Assembly while answering questions from journalists shortly after a brief ceremony at the Presidential Villa.\n\nThe Senate President said, \u201cEveryone knows that the Petroleum Industry Bill suffered a lot of hiccups in the National Assembly previously but when we came in 2019, both chambers identified the passage of the PIB as one very strong, fundamental, critical and strategic bill that we must pass within the life cycle of this 9th National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAnd by the Grace of God, we redefined the way to go about it because we would have learnt from the mistakes of the past on the issue. And what we emphasised and that worked for us to achieve what we did was to ensure that we work very closely with the executive arm of government right from the conception of the bill itself.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, approved a steering committee to supervise the implementation of the newly signed Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement titled, \u2018President Buhari Approves Steering Committee on Petroleum Industry Act\u2019.\n\nAccording to the statement, the steering committee, which is headed by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, has 12 months to complete its assignment.\n\nOther members of the committee are the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr Nasir Gwarzo; the Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari; Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Muhammad Nami; a representative of the Ministry of Justice; a representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources, Olufemi Lijadu as External Legal Adviser; while the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund, Dr Bello Gusau, will serve as Head of the Coordinating Secretariat and the Implementation Working Group.\n\nAdesina stated, \u201cThe steering committee shall guide the effective and timely implementation of the PIA in the course of transition to the petroleum industry envisaged in the reform programme, and ensure that the new institutions created have the full capability to deliver on their mandate under the new legislation.\n\n\u201cThe committee has 12 months for the assignment and periodic updates will be given to the President.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the President, on Wednesday, lamented the loss of $50bn worth of investments in the petroleum industry since 2011 due to the absence of the PIA.\n\nBuhari made this assertion in Abuja at a ceremony on the passage of the PIA, which preceded the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nAdesina disclosed this in a statement titled, \u2018Nigeria Lost Estimated $50bn Worth of Investments in 10 years due to Stagnation, Uncertainty over Petroleum Industry, says President Buhari\u2019.\n\nAccording to the President, the loss was due to the uncertainty of the non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill and lack of progress and stagnation in the petroleum industry, which he blamed on the lack of political will on the part of past administrations to actualise the needed transformation.\n\nThe President said his assent to the PIB on August 16, 2021 marked the end of decades of uncertainty and under-investment in Nigeria\u2019s petroleum industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are all aware that past administrations had identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was a lack of political will to actualise this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past 10 years, Nigeria lost an estimated $50bn worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our administration has found it necessary to work with the two chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that the signing of the bill was part of the regime\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investment, improve revenue base, create jobs and support the economic diversification agenda.\n\nHe appealed to host communities to accept the new regulation, saying it would bring lasting benefits to them.\n\nThe President stated, \u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable the sustainable development of host communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Act, whose implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), says it is committed to a democratic process of negotiating reform of the country, to make it more responsive to the needs of Nigerians.\n\nAlhaji Abubakar Bagudu, Chairman of the forum, gave the assurance in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, while speaking on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cPGF commends President Buhari for this historic feat of moving the nation forward to a new democratic era of governance and business, through the management of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to a democratic process of negotiating the reform of our republic to make it more responsive to the needs of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe pledge our commitment to support the process of transition to the new era of oil and gas operations and management, as provided by the new Petroleum Industry Act 2021.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we are indeed more confident that the ongoing process of a constitutional amendment in the National Assembly, will proffer more reforms to the Nigerian economy,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBagudu assured that the forum would continue to collaborate with the national assembly and the Federal Government to mobilise public understanding, to accelerate the process of change in the country.\n\nHe added that through its engagements with the leadership of the national assembly, the PGF would continue to provide needed support, to enhance the existing synergy between the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nHe said the forum would also continue to draw lessons from President Buhari\u2019s leadership and take necessary steps to replicate same in states of the federation.\n\nBagudu who is also the governor of Kebbi, noted that the signing into law of PIB by the president, would restructure operations and management of the country`s oil and gas industry.\n\nHe added that, with the coming into law of the new act, the APC, under Buhari`s leadership, had demonstrated unwavering commitment to change the country democratically.\n\nBagudu noted that this milestone was reached after over 20 years of endless national debates and stalemate on the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is today, a new petroleum industry Act in the country, which has provided six months transition for the emergence of new institutional framework for the operations of oil and gas industry in the country.\n\n\u201cWith the new Act, the task of regulation is vested on the two regulatory bodies created by the law.\n\n\u201cThe extraction and sales of crude will now be undertaken by both the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. and other private companies in both the upstream, midstream and downstream,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added that this would be in line with regulatory standards, provided by the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority created by the Act.\n\nHe further explained that the Act also created a Host Communities Development Trust, to be managed by Board of Trustees as provided by it.\n\nHe said that three per cent profit from the operations of oil and gas businesses, would be used for the development of host communities, as provided by the Act.\n\nHe added that this was in addition to the existing 13 per cent derivation to oil producing states and funds, allocated to the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\n\u201cWe join all Nigerians to celebrate this important achievement in the operations and management of Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cWe also want to use this opportunity to congratulate members of the two chambers of the national assembly for the successful passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cWithout the cooperation of members of the national assembly, especially the leadership, with all the discordant voices around the debate, the new PIB law would have been aborted, like in the past,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBagudu said the new Act, presented a convincing credential of the commitment of the APC, to restructure Nigerian economy through democratic process in line with provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with the democratic engagements, based on strategic considerations of legislative proposals in the national assembly to make or review existing laws, the Nigerian economy would be fully restructured.\n\nHe said even critics of the APC-led government could not ignore the fact that the passage of the Act, was an important democratic milestone.\n\nAccording to the PGF chairman, it is a signpost of commitment of the APC government to develop the oil and gas sector and resolve all challenges associated with operations of the sector.\n\n\u201cWith the new Act, there should be remarkable improvement in revenue collection from the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThis is expectedly, the next level of governance initiatives our party promised Nigerians, during the 2019 campaigns,\u2019\u2019 Bagudu said.\n\nThe PGF is an umbrella body of serving governors, elected on the APC platform.\n\nVanguard News

          "text": "Senate President, Ahmad Lawan\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2013PRESIDENT of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan yesterday said if there are identified areas in the newly signed Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, that require amendment, they should be brought to the National Assembly for legislative action.\n\nThe President of the Senate also said that no human beings could be perfect and that most difficult issues can still be brought back to the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:PIB: Buhari has again shown courage to do the right thing \u2015 APC\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari had on Monday signed the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, into law.\n\nLawan stated this while fielding questions from journalists shortly after a brief ceremony at the Presidential Villa where the President announced the setting up of an implementation Committee for the new law.\n\nHe said it is when implementation starts, that\u2019s when people will start to see where and where amendment is needed.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo this is something we all have to address with some optimism and hope that it would be okay. But because we are human beings, no act of human beings could be perfect. So when we are able to see issues, the National Assembly is there. Bring them for amendment. Even the most difficult issues can still be brought back to the National Assembly. If it is worthwhile to do so. But I believe that there is no need for us to be emphasising the problems rather than the prospects.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on the agitation for more funds for the host communities, Lawan said the host communities are winners as well, though It may not be necessarily exactly what some of them had hoped, with time, such issues will be further addressed.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut you know from zero to over 500 million dollars and with time, such issues will be further addressed but I want to also caution that it is not the 500 million dollars that is more but how we are able to prudently and transparently deploy this 500 million dollar in the host communities. This time around, there should be no excuses for anybody to tamper with this money. The host communities have suffered enough, even when NDDC was established, I\u2019m sure it was established because of the host communities\u2019 issues and yet the host communities did not get much attention.\n\n\u201cThis time, the host communities have been specifically mentioned and these funds should go there. We want to see people who will be appointed, taking this as trust and do what is right. Of course, there will be so much employment and jobs especially in the midstream of the value chain. This midstream has not been in existence so to speak. What we have is the upstream and then, the downstream. When our refineries will be better and more will be established, I\u2019m sure the value chain will have opportunity for more Nigerians to have jobs and so on. I believe that this is one very historic and important moment for us as a National Assembly, this Ninth National Assembly and of course a very historic moment for this administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that previous administrations tried and as hard as they tried, they could not do it. This is one Bill that saw the faces of so many people between the executive and the legislature in the past and yet it could not be passed. The ninth National Assembly by the Grace of God had done the magic and the President had signed it and today we have a Petroleum Industry Act. Glory be to God.\u201d",

It is on record that bandits are occupying some local governments in Nigeria. This means with time they can take over a State in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn essence, the Federal Government should urgently deal decisively with the bandits before they will destroy Nigeria. The Taliban take over could equally motivate the bandits to one-day attempt to take over Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cThis is not a false alarm, but a timely warning. Most of the bandits may not be Nigerians and one should not doubt the possibility of them being sponsored by some foreign countries.\n\n\u201cTaliban were being sponsored.

          "title": "Nigeria: Tragedies of double neo-colonialism",
          "text": "The colonisation of the broad territory later christened Nigeria began in August 1861. It came to an end (at least on paper) in October 1960. This was a major phase in the chequered past of the country. Such resources as timber, ivory, palm oil, cocoa, groundnut, tin, and coffee were cheaply exported to Europe at the expense of Nigerianisation or local industrialisation. The finished products arising from these natural resources were later returned to Nigeria to be bought at exorbitant prices. Most political leaders especially during this early period of our modern history, wrongly assumed that with the attainment of political independence, economic prosperity would necessarily follow. But unfortunately, the colonialists were much smarter than the Nigerian political class by surreptitiously introducing (after October 1960), a new form of economic exploitation and oppression popularly called neo-colonialism, a repackaged version of Europeanisation or Westernisation.\n\nDiplomatic manoeuvres led to the creation of several world bodies aimed at promoting Western values and economic supremacy. One of these bodies is the British Commonwealth of Nations- a \u201cvoluntary\u201d association of 54 independent and equal countries. It is pertinent to note here, that even with the physical exit of the colonialists, raw material economy continues unabated in Nigeria. Again, Nigeria\u2019s membership of such Bretton Woods Institutions (BWI) as the World Bank, World Trade Organisation (WTO), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) remains cosmetic in a number of ways. Nigeria is largely voiceless even in the face of poisonous policies. Nigerian values are being bastardised steadily despite the appointment of a few Nigerian/African technocrats to key positions in these organisations. The inclusion of the above, is just a game plan to avoid being accused of promoting exclusionary global politics. The West and parts of Asia like China and Japan continue to rule Nigeria and by extension, the entirety of the African world. Pan-Africanism is highly indispensable.\n\nNigeria still lacks capital and technological skill or expertise to convert theory into practice. Foreign investors bring in, the much needed managerial and technical staff with a very little amount of space for Nigerians to participate in the industrial enterprises. Local production of items like detergent, toilet soap, and alcoholic drinks or beverages are largely handled by these foreigners. In this regard, many Nigerian youths are employed only on a casual basis usually under the most appalling conditions in their fatherland, as the political \u201cleaders\u201d look the other way. The Nigerian political \u201cleaders\u201d refuse to protect the local industries from external predation due to their unfettered self-interest and a gross lack of patriotism. It is a great pity that almost 61 years after independence, Nigeria remains a stunted baby who is unable to crawl let alone walk. Our so-called foreign business partners are in actuality, business superiors who purchase Nigeria\u2019s local raw materials including cassava and yam tubers very cheaply to boost their industrial economies. They fix prices of these commodities in such places as Britain, France, Germany, and the US. Therefore, the numerous crises in Nigeria are enshrined in both internal and external neo-colonialism.\n\nIt is on record, that Kwame Nkrumah-the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana (1957 to 1960) was a prominent, radical Pan-Africanist. He passionately tried to promote Pan-Africanism with a view to consolidating and safe-guarding the liberties and independence of the free African states. But painfully, his colleagues never saw the dangers ahead. Many of Nkrumah\u2019s warning signs of neo-colonialism /economic imperialism proved prophetic in the long run. This African political giant knew the workings of the West especially its power of diplomatic manoeuvres. Although Nkrumah was then the most charismatic leader in the continent, James Johnson of Yoruba parentage, but born in Sierra-Leone about 1835 was the earliest promoter of Pan-Africanism. However, challenges arising from ideological differences did not allow the African leaders to work together for the common good. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) established in Addis Ababa in 1963 was a caricature of Pan-Africanism. The African Union (AU) that was created to replace OAU in 2002 in Durban, South Africa remains the same. No significant impact on Africa with respect to global politics as if sustainable development matters. Consequently, Nigeria, a microcosm of Africa remains a puppet with strings to be pulled at any time by the world powers.\n\nThe second level of neo-colonialism results from the selfish style of the Nigerian political class. The Nigerian political class and foreigners looting our collective resources, are on a par. Both groups are guilty of the serial raping of our beautiful mother Nigeria. The former continues to play a politics of desperation including primitivity at the expense of the common good. The Nigerian political rulers are fond of destroying their national heritage as they keep their ill-gotten monies in European and/or American banks while abject material poverty continues to ravage the country. In my opinion, it is unprofitable to continue to blame Europe and America for Nigeria\u2019s economic and socio-political woes (after six decades of independence), as if we lack the mental capacity to craft a new beginning for the agonising geo-polity.\n\nIt is against this backdrop, that the statement given below gains its relevance. \u201cTwo enemies of the people, are criminals and government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of constitution, so the second will not become the legalised version of the first.\u201d\n\nI agree with the above claim by the 3rd President of the US (1801 and 1809), Thomas Jefferson. He was a multi-talented man whose areas of interest straddled the domains of archaeology, architecture, and politics among others. Jefferson\u2019s statement shows that an active followership has to be kept on the front burner of Nigerian politics, as elsewhere around the world. Nigerian political rulers must do away with relics of stone age impulses that are holding us down as a country. Nigeria must begin to play its leadership role in the sun. Our challenges are neither embedded in ethnicity nor religion. They (challenges) are rooted in bad leadership and to a limited extent, passive followership. The masses must come together to fight the injustices of the political class and its hedonistic business associates, who are constantly inflicting excruciating pains on us because they lack the milk of human kindness and charismatic leadership.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently, the Emir of Muri in Taraba State gave a 30-day ultimatum to those criminals occupying the forest in his district, to quit or face serious consequences. Similarly, the Emir of Katsina appealed to the state government on August 5, to ban open grazing. This was as a result of incessant banditry and kidnapping allegedly by some cattle herders. Indeed, 10 Local Government Areas of Katsina State are now under siege. The legitimate worries and actions of these eminent northern Nigerian monarchs emanated from commendable honesty. These are also in tandem with the position of the Benue and southern governors. Open grazing of cattle and unbridled, primordial ethno-religious impulses in the 21st century, are at variance with modernity and/or sustainable development. Nigeria can only be an exception at its own peril.",

          "title": "Of IBB, Okupe and 2023 presidency",
          "text": "Dr. Doyin Okupe, remember him? Of course, everyone knows that great son of Iperu, Remo, Ogun State, as a stellar medic of many years standing, lifting the banner of the great Okupe clan to higher heights.\n\nYou can also trust Okupe, a core Yoruba political conservative, to follow his core conscience, even if his fellow conservatives falter. That explains his involvement in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) movement during the hot years, under Gen. Sani Abacha, to revalidate the MKO Abiola June 12 mandate, which annulment had consumed the annuller-in-chief, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nBut maybe not many would remember Okupe, though a medic, as President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s first presidential spin master, as special assistant on Media and Publicity \u2013an apparent carry-over as publicity czar, of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC).\n\nNRC was the \u201ca little bit to the right\u201d Siamese twin, to the \u201ca little bit to the left\u201d Social Democratic Party (SDP), in IBB\u2019s glorious era of eternal political transition, which nevertheless birthed a cancelled election! With IBB, therefore, Okupe would appear to have come a long way.\n\nStill, the excitable spin-master, as against the deliberative, clinical medic, seems to have violently seized Okupe. In a rush, Okupe has claimed IBB had him in mind, when he told Arise TV that he had pencilled down at least three suitable candidates, in their 60s, who would succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIBB, visioner-in-chief, in the powerful IBB Selectorate 2023, had roared on Arise TV: \u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to, and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with. That is a person,\u201d he lectured, \u201cwho is very versed in economics, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties. I believe so if we can get him,\u201d he declared with oracular finality!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut IBB had hardly finished his selectorate lecture before Okupe rushed to Arise TV studios, and with bated breath, declared: \u201cI am he!\u201d IBB, the triumphant Okupe enthused, \u201chad me in mind.\u201d More: \u201cthere\u2019s no local government in this country that I\u2019ve not visited five times.\u201d Even more: \u201cI\u2019m the most fairly well-prepared person to be president\u201d. Not forgetting: \u201cI\u2019m in my 60s\u201d. Ha!\n\nOkupe is 69, vigorously knocking on the door of 70.\n\nWell, Okupe is no stranger to spectacular goofs. The other time, he told folks to call him a \u201cbastard\u201d if the newly formed APC lasted a year. As it turned out, the same APC sacked him and his principal, President Goodluck Jonathan from power.\n\nAs to the selector-in-chief, need anyone remind Okupe the last time IBB was posturing on future presidents, even as powerful, self-declared \u201cmilitary president\u201d, none qualified, beyond IBB himself \u2014 except that he, who was not only in office but also in power, lacked the guts to say so!\n\nMoral? Believe IBB and you can believe Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth\u2019s three witches!\n\nStill, Okupe has a democratic right to own airy delusions. Even if it turns out no more than the bastard debacle, Okupe would carry his own cross. He is burly, sturdy and hefty enough to do that with ease!",

          "title": "Arewa, Yoruba, Igbo, M\u2019Belt elders support Masari\u2019s self-defence call",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya, Magnus Eze, Chinelo Obogo, Chukwudi Nweje, Noah Ebije Kaduna and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration has come under scurrilous attack for allegedly failing to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerians.\n\nReacting to the Katsina Governor, Bello Masari\u2019s admonition to his people on Tuesday to acquire arms and defend themselves against bandits, the Ohanaeze, the Afenifere, the Middle Belt Forum (MBLF) and other prominent Nigerians, criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC) for failing to carry out its primary responsibility as a government. They agree that the security situation has reached a point where Nigerians must take their destiny in their own hands.\n\nThis is not the first time top government functionaries are calling for self-help over what they considered precarious situation. In February, Minister of Defense, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd) had challenged Nigerians to show that they were not cowards by defending themselves.\n\n\u201cIn our younger days, we stand to fight any aggression coming for us. I don\u2019t know why people are running from minor things like that. They should stand and let these people know that even the villagers have the competency and capabilities to defend themselves,\u201d he said. In May, Governor Samuel Ortom had also enjoined residents to rise up and defend themselves against every form of attack.\n\nReacting yesterday, National publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said Masari\u2019s call was a dangerous trend that indicated the failure of government in its social contract to protect the people.\n\n\u201cNow, the instruments of violence are no longer the monopoly of government and the government now asking the people to arm and defend themselves is a dangerous trend. Arms have proliferated among the people and it is a sign of a failed state.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze calls on the government to work hard to avert the impending doom to Nigeria.\n\nAfenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Nigeria was in a mess and the situation in Afghanistan was already playing out in the country. He regretted that Nigerians were living in denial, saying the nation was gradually cascading toward a totalitarian state.\n\nThe elder statesman stressed the need to change the 1999 constitution, cautioning that the 2023 election may not hold if the status quo remains.\n\nPublicity Secretary of MBLF, Dr. Dogo Isuwa, said the right to self-defence is constitutionally guaranteed, but that of providing defence that the Federal Government failed in should be vested in regional security outfits like Amotekun controlled by governments to prevent abuse.\n\nBut for the spokesman, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Emmanuel Yawe, governor as chief security officer has the constitutional powers to put in place security measures that would safeguard his state. He said other governors can emulate Masari if they feel that such measure would help their respective states.\n\n\u201cGovernor of Katsina, as provided in the 1999 Constitution, is the chief security officer of his state. He is, therefore, permitted by the constitution to introduce security measures within the boundaries of his state and his state alone. If other states in the country see that his measures are good and have helped in securing the state, there is no stopping them from emulating his policies. Anybody who lives in Nigeria knows how bad our situation is. You don\u2019t need to ask whether Nigerian citizens have a right to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nA group, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), said Masari urging people to acquire arms and defend themselves was a sign of frustration with the Nigerian security services. Its spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the call on the citizenry to arm and defend themselves was a natural reaction given the circumstances they found themselves in Katsina and other states. However, the Igbo National Council (INC) urged Masari to take the first step of self-defence in his state even as it pointed out that Igbo would protect themselves from the killer herdsmen and other hoodlums terrorising the zone.\n\nIts National President, Chilos Godsent, in a statement, noted that it was a clear indication that President Buhari has failed to secure the lives of Nigerians and therefore called for his immediate resignation.\n\nBut Elder Statesman, Tanko Yakassai, said though the security situation is bad, it has not got to the stage where people would have to take up arms to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cMasari sounded like a pessimist by saying that. But don\u2019t forget that we have 36 governors and he is just one of them. If it was a meeting of governors and they took a decision along that line, then it can be enforced. Whether someone is a governor or not, he is an individual in Nigeria and his views are not law; he is just expressing his personal opinion. I don\u2019t see his statement as a positive development but I don\u2019t give it the value others are giving it because I know that Nigerians are going about their businesses. So, the point is that the situation in Nigeria is not good but it is not as bad as it is being painted and I do not pray that we should get to the stage where people would have to take up arms to defend themselves,\u201d Yakassai said.\n\nBut former lawmaker, Senator Rufai Hanga said Masari\u2019s statement was a vote of no confidence in the president who also hails from Katsina.\n\n\u201cThat also confirms what people have always said, that the security situation in the country is terrible and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any capacity from the government to defeat it. Masari has only proved the president\u2019s critics right.\u201d\n\n\u2022Director Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu reacts\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard of calls on citizens to pick up arms to defend themselves from other quarters, so it\u2019s not an isolated case.The governor is the chief security officer of the state, therefore, the zeal and passion for the protection and security of his people is what I see here. I believe that the call is to promote citizens engagement in tackling the menace, such as forming vigilante groups, similar to the Civilian JTF in the North East. However, in the demonstration of this, it is necessary to remind ourselves that possession of firearms is a subject under regulatory or statutory control. We must understand that the employment or deployment of the instrument of violence is a function of state power and anything contrary could orchestrate breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThe Joint security forces are relentless and are working round the clock to ensure normalcy is restored in the troubled areas. Sadly, these criminals are taken advantage of the taciturn posture of the people, in not volunteering information to the security forces. Timely and actionable information is a major game changer in tackling this insecurity menace.\n\n\u201cWe urge well meaning members of the public, particularly in the concerned areas to support the security forces and collectively, we can defeat our common adversaries.\u201d",
          "summary": "They agree that the security situation has reached a point where Nigerians must take their destiny in their own hands.\nBut for the spokesman, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Emmanuel Yawe, governor as chief security officer has the constitutional powers to put in place security measures that would safeguard his state.\n\u201cGovernor of Katsina, as provided in the 1999 Constitution, is the chief security officer of his state.\nHe is, therefore, permitted by the constitution to introduce security measures within the boundaries of his state and his state alone.\n\u201cThat also confirms what people have always said, that the security situation in the country is terrible and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any capacity from the government to defeat it.",

Opalola said poison of carbon monoxide (generator fume) is suspected to be the cause, but the result of autopsy would confirm the cause of death.\n\nShe said a generator was found in the house and a report that the generator was used by the family the previous day gave suspicion to carbon monoxide poisoning. She said Investigation was ongoing to know the real cause of the deaths.\n\nShe said:\u201cOne person, a 14-year- old- girl, was found still alive,though unconscious, and she was rushed to the hospital where she is recuperating.\n\n\u201cThe remains of the other dead members of the family had also been taken to Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Teaching Hospital, in Ile-Ife, where autopsy will be carried out on them to ascertain the cause of their death.\n\n\u201cThe dead persons were discovered by neighbours who believed they died in their sleep.

He said these groups of people have turned alms begging and hawking into a huge business by collecting returns from beggars and hawkers, who incidentally sleep under bridges, motor parks and uncompleted buildings. He said intelligence reports also revealed that some of the beggars went about with dangerous weapons, assaulting and robbing innocent residents.\n\n\u201cThe special team will tackle the menace frontally and would commence operation in the next few days,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner said the task of the team was not only to sanitise the society, but also restore the dignity of hawkers and beggars.\n\nDawodu said beggars on streets and roads constituted considerable nuisance to law abiding citizens, who were entitled to go about their businesses without any fear or hindrance.\n\nHe said street begging was a social vice that government cannot afford to watch attain uncontrollable level in order not to affect the good plans and programmes to transform the state.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of Oyo State High Court, sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, yesterday extended the restraining order in favour of a Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, against the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), Department of State Security Service (DSS) and Director of SSS in the state.\n\nThe suit was instituted by Igboho, following the bloody raid on his house in Ibadan in the early hours of July 1, this year, by the DSS in collaboration with other security agencies. During the raid, two persons were killed and about 13 persons among Igboho\u2019s aides were arrested during the operation and were later paraded in the evening of the same July 1 by the DSS in Abuja.\n\nJustice Akintola also awarded a cost of N50,000 against the AGF over filing his response to the processes filed by Igboho out of time, though the legal team of Igboho had asked for a cost of N250,000. But the court granted the extension of time in the interest of justice.\n\nAt the resumed hearing yesterday, three Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) appeared for Igboho. They are Yomi Alliyu, Adekola Olawoye, and Oladipo Olasope. However, Abdullahi Abubakar appeared for AGF, while T. A. Nurudeen, appeared for second and third respondents.\n\nThe court had on Wednesday August 4, this year, granted a restraining order against the DSS and AGF, from arresting, intimidating, harassing and freezing the bank accounts of Igboho.\n\nThe case with number M/435/2021, instituted by Igboho, against the trio of AGF as first respondent, DSS as second respondent, and Director of DSS in Oyo State as third respondent.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), who moved an ex-parte motion before the court on August 4, had on Friday, July 23, 2021, filed a notice of application for the enforcement of Igboho\u2019s fundamental human rights before the court.\n\nIn the main suit, Igboho is also praying the court to order the respondents jointly and separately to pay him N500billion as special damages for the damage done to his car and residence, as well as exemplary and/or aggravated damages for breaching his fundamental rights in the course of illegal and/or malicious invasion of his residence.\n\nGiving the injunctions, Justice Akintola directed that both the AGF and the national headquarters of SSS should be served with the injunctions in Abuja, while the Director of SSS in Oyo State should be served in Ibadan. The judge also gave the respondents 14 days to make appearance before the court, before adjourning the case to August 18, for further hearing.\n\nBut counsel to the first respondent, Abubakar prayed the court for an extension of time for AGF to file his response to the processes filed by Igboho. Nurudeen, counsel to the second and third respondents, also aligned with the position of Abubakar, as he never objected to it. But lead council to Igboho, Alliyu, vehemently opposed the extension, saying the response should have been filed within five days of the receipt of the court processes.\n\nBut Abubakar and Nurudeen filed an application on their preliminary objections to the case, asking the court to vacate the restraining order, and strike out or dismiss the suit. The court, however, adjourned the case to Monday August 30, this year, for decision on the application.\n\nIn the notice of preliminary objections by the AGF, he challenged the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the case, adding that Igboho\u2019s claim of unlawful killing, tort of trespass, assault and battery could not be brought under Fundamental Right (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009.\n\n\u201cThe claims for damages for invasion of house, unlawful killing, tort of trespass, assault, battery and allegation of discrimination and secessionist cannot be resolved by way of affidavit evidence without calling witnesses, tendering of documents and even a likely visit to \u2018locus in quo.\u201d\n\nOn the order not to freeze Igboho\u2019s bank account, the AGF said the blocking of Igboho\u2019s bank account \u201cis a complete action of the second and third respondents, which can only be challenged before the Federal High Court, pursuant to Section 251 (r) of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended).\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria lost an estimated $50 billion worth of investments in 10 years due to non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), lack of progress and stagnation in the petroleum industry.\n\nThe President stated this in his remarks at a ceremony on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which preceded the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, yesterday. He said stagnation affected the growth of the economy blaming the lack of political will by past administrations to actualise the needed transformation in the petroleum industry as contributing to the loss of that sum of money.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said assent to the PIB on August 16 marked the end of decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that past administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was lack of political will to actualise this needed transformation. This lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past 10 years, Nigeria has lost an estimated $50 billion worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB. This administration believes that the timely passage of the PIB will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\u201d\n\nThe President said the country and investors would derive improved benefits from a stable fiscal framework which the PIA brings along.\n\nHe said the signing of the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investment, improve revenue base, create jobs and support economic diversification agenda. He said the Petroleum Industry Act would create a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of host communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them. Furthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), he urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nThe president named Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, as head of the PIA implementation team and urged all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition designed to reposition the economy through the new Act.\n\nOther members of the committee are Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources; Group Managing Director, NNPC; Executive Chairman, FIRS; Representative of the Ministry of Justice, Representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources, Olufemi Lijadu as External Legal Adviser, while Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund, will serve as Head of Coordinating Secretariat and Implementation Working Group.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, has cautioned against tampering or manipulation in the disbursement of the three per cent (about $500 million) compensation in the PIA which accrues to host communities by appointed persons to manage it. He urged prudent deployment of the money, specifically earmarked to engender development in host communities and end their suffering.\n\nLawan, who spoke to State House Correspondents after the president\u2019s statement on the PIA, urged Nigerians not to focus on the grievances associated with the new Act, but remain optimistic that the Act (which can be amended) would be implemented. He equally expressed confidence that the PIA would further incentivise greater investment in the sector.",

          "text": "\u2022FG: No immediate removal of petrol subsidy\n\n\u2022Explains why govs are clamouring for price hike\n\n\u2022Private sector operators, APC commend president on new oil sector law\n\n\u2022Wike: 3% allocation to host Communities insufficient\n\nEmmanuel Addeh,\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari will today unveil an implementation committee for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\nTHISDAY exclusively gathered from a reliable source in the Presidency that the committee may be chaired by either the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva or someone with good knowledge of development economics.\n\nThe committee which has 12 months to carry out its tasks, would be saddled with the responsibility of establishment of Nigeria Upstream Regulatory Commission, Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority as well as the corporatisation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to a Limited Liability Company, which will now be called Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.\n\nIn addition, the committee would also be tasked with the responsibility of determining the assets and liabilities of the NNPC, which would be transferred to NNPC Limited.\n\nAlso, the committee would be tasked with the responsibility of determining the stranded or toxic assets and liabilities which would be taken over by government.\n\n\u201cThe committee has 12 months to finish its job. Also, the committee will look into the conversion of the Oil Prospecting Licences (OPL) and Oil Mining Licences (OML) to Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) and Petroleum Mining Licences (PML) respectively, which are the new names under the Act,\u201d the source who preferred to remain anonymous added.\n\nThe PIA which was birthed on Monday, would serve as framework for the operations in the oil and gas industry. The law which had suffered several setbacks since 2008, when it was first presented to the National Assembly, aims at removing legal and regulatory uncertainties that have held back the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe PIA provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nBut the federal government yesterday clarified that it is not going to immediately remove the current subsidy being paid on the pump price of petrol, saying that it intends to manage the process to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians are not heavily impacted.\n\nHowever, while members of the organised private sector and the president\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday welcomed the PIA, saying it would unlock investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has described the three per cent allocation for host communities in the Niger Delta region as contained in the PIA as meagre.\n\nFG: No Immediate Removal of Petrol Subsidy\n\nThe federal government has said it will not immediately end its current subsidy regime, saying it intends to manage the process to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians are not heavily impacted.\n\nSylva, who spoke at a briefing in Abuja, to mark his two years in office, noted that although desirable, operationalising the free market regime would require that a lot of economic shock absorbers will be out in place.\n\nSylva noted that because deregulation would come with a lot of changes, it would not be advisable to suddenly remove the subsidy, saying it would become a reality when the law becomes fully operational.\n\n\u201cIt (deregulation) is something that is desirable, which I have always said. I\u2019ve never deviated from that. Deregulation is desirable because that is the sustainable way out of where we are. But also, the reality is that deregulation is going to come with some changes.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, when people have been used to certain behaviours, behavioural patterns which means you\u2019ve been used to subsidy for this long, and you want to change that, you have to have some kind of change management process in place.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just change the policy on everybody without looking at some of the problems that this might create. One of which is that we know that this is going to entail increase in price. How do we alleviate the problems that will come with this increase?\n\n\u201cThis is not a mindless government. It is a government that really, really cares about the Nigerians. So, we have to really look at all these possibilities of how to at least alleviate the pains and the problems that this increase might occasion. And that\u2019s why we are taking our time. And that\u2019s why it will not happen overnight.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m just telling you that there is a provision in PIA that will make this happen, that we have to jointly ensure that we\u2019re able to come up with a workable way of making this happen. And that process is already ongoing,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe admitted that although the new law has actually deregulated the sector, it wouldn\u2019t mean that there would be an immediate implementation of pricing.\n\nThe minister further said that governors were asking for deregulation and by extension a price increase because it would be in their interest, adding that a hike means they would have access to more revenue from the federation account.\n\nHe noted that governors are currently getting less from the federation, saying that they had realised that in the end, they are just cutting their noses to spite their face with subsidy.\n\nAlso, contrary to the position of the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, that Nigeria was consuming about 103 million petrol daily, Sylva described that figure as a \u201cflash\u201d which happens once in a while, pegging the figure at 52 million litres daily consumption on the average.\n\n\u201cBut of course, you know we have flashes. Sometimes, we have these flashes. The daily consumption was at about 66 million litres per day when we came in, and were able to bring it down to about 52 million. That\u2019s really the average.\n\n\u201cBut once in a while, you have that flash and it goes up, maybe because of the activity of smugglers. Well, those are not really the ideal situations, so you cannot really use that as the measure of what is the average consumption.\n\n\u201cThe average product consumption has actually reduced from about 66 million on average. But of course you can\u2019t discount these flashes that you have, which you cannot really judge us on,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the host communities\u2019 fund, the minister explained that it was better to have three per cent of what the communities are sure of.\n\nHe described all the levies and taxes paid by oil companies as a balancing act, saying the new legislation has been fair to the host communities and pointing out that for the first time, there is now a pool of funds targeted at the host communities in this country.\n\nOn the rising prices of cooking gas, the minister stated that the market has been fully deregulated, emphasising that government was no longer in control of how much the product is sold.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a position to determine gas pricing because gas is not a regulated product. But then we are also very concerned that prices are high. We are also doing something about it.\n\n\u201cJust in the interest of the ordinary Nigerian, I have discussed with some of the suppliers. But I can tell you that it is not really our role. But just in the interest of Nigerians we are trying to see how we can intervene with the suppliers and have discussions to allow us see how we can bring down the price of gas to make it more affordable.\n\n\u201cI understand that the average cost of cylinder now is N5,000 to N6,000. But we are following the price and we are doing something about it with the suppliers,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe minister who also took time to explain the frontier exploration fund, noted that the frontier territories are not only in one area of the country.\n\n\u201cThere are frontier territories in Cross River, in the North-east and in the South-west. So when people just locate frontier territories in one part of the country and settle on that, then there\u2019s a problem. So, we must come together as a country, frontier and host communities,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe argued that Nigeria has had about 37 billion barrels reserve for the past 10 years and has not added to it, saying there was need to bring vigour into the industry.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go back to where we are coming from. Let\u2019s look forward as a country, we must look at Nigeria. First, who is the one that is gaining. And I think in this case, it is Nigeria that is the ultimate beneficiary,\u201d he noted.\n\nSylva added that the sector has been able to reduce the cost of production by over 5 per cent, despite the issues of currency fluctuations, as the industry has rationalised contracts, renegotiated others, while many expatriates who were paid in hard currency left because of COVID-19 pandemic, allowing Nigerians to step in.\n\nOPS Hails Buhari, Call for Transparent Implementation of New Law\n\nMeanwhile, representatives of the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) have commended the federal government over the PIA.\n\nBoth the Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, and the Director General of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Dr. Timothy Olawale, said the PIA was a landmark decision.\n\nThe representatives of the OPSN, in separate statements noted that the PIA 2021, would herald a positive change in the oil and gas industry, noting that they looked forward to a more robust industry with improved investor confidence and the creation of more employment opportunities for the generality of Nigerians.\n\nOlawale stated that, \u201cthe relevant changes to the governance, administration, regulatory and fiscal framework of the petroleum industry will enhance transparency and further position the industry to contribute effectively to national development.\n\n\u201cWhile some provisions of the PIA are far-reaching with various degrees of implication and consequences for operators in the industry, we urge the government to create a platform of proactive and continuous engagement with the operators in the sector for a smooth implementation of the provisions of the PIA.\u201d\n\nHe urged the federal government to carry stakeholders along in setting up the implementation and monitoring committee in order to ensure the maximisation of the benefits inherent in the PIA.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Olukanni, said NACCIMA expects that the PIA would reposition the Nigerian oil and gas sector to attract more investments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NACCIMA welcomes the signing into law of the PIB by President Bhuari. After a long journey, the association commends this bold and strategic step to reposition the Nigerian oil and gas sector to restore investor confidence and attract much needed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and local participation.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the growth of the sector had been stagnated as a number of principal players, \u201cplaced new investments on hold or even divested existing assets due to perceived unstable legal and policy environment.\u201d\n\nThe director general of the NACCIMA also noted that, a restructured NNPC and its ownership structure would help create a wider opportunity and space for members and the oil producing communities to participate.\n\nOlukanni, however, noted that NACCIMA was of the view that the PIA should be implemented in a structured and disciplined manner in order for it to achieve its purpose in the long run.\n\nHe said: \u201cSuch an implementation approach will ensure transparency and focus while reinforcing confidence among local and international players.\n\n\u201cIt is also the view of the association that the private sector is in a prime position to drive the realisation of the objectives of the PIB and as such should receive the requisite support and policy enablement to play this key role in the upstream, midstream and downstream segments.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former Senior Technical Adviser, Upstream and Gas, at the Ministry of Petroleum, Gbite Adeniji, yesterday said the PIA would cut wastages in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSpeaking on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Adeniji, who was an adviser when Dr. Ibe Kachikwu was petroleum minister, said the new law is not only a petroleum sector reform document, but an economic legislation that could remarkably impact the country.\n\nHe explained that the Act would open the petroleum sector up to a new wave of opportunities, stressing that the country now has a basis for deregulating the downstream.\n\n\u201cWe can cut away all the subsidies that we have completely mismanaged in the last 20 or more years, and redirect some of that towards more useful social and economic needs in the country.\n\n\u201cIt also creates the opportunity for leveraging on Nigeria\u2019s main abundant natural resource, which is natural gas, because if you look at the law, it\u2019s got provisions galore on natural gas.\n\n\u201cAnd this is the first time ever, we actually have provisions dealing with that endowment. So when you think of the energy transition, if you have clarity around the legislative framework for gas, I think that basically positions Nigeria for that future,\u201d he said.\n\nAdeniji emphasised the need to move quickly into a gas-based industrialisation era, stressing that the new law also addresses issues around environmental regulation in the industry, both in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\nHe explained that as Nigeria liberalises its oil and gas industry, it also needs laws that would curtail the potential for abuses and monopoly, which the new legislation substantially addresses, saying aside the NNPC, the industry has a number of monopoly operators currently.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a statutory duty to move away from subsidies. We then have to now see how they set up the regulatory agencies, and how they actually go about implementing the mandate, which is to see that the wholesale transactions as well as seeing petroleum products being sold on a willing buyer, willing seller basis, as opposed to the way we are doing things currently,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that there would be need to appoint experienced management consultants to support the process to see to the proper design of the new national oil company, which the law envisages.\n\nWhile stressing that six months might be too short to do a proper job of assessing and unpacking the assets that are not critical to the future of the new national oil company, including the issue of liabilities, Adeniji noted that competent hands should be hired to turn around the fortunes of the corporation.\n\nOn the refineries, he stated that although currently a liability, the facilities have the capacity to begin to add massive value to the operations of the corporation when they start working.\n\nWith PIA, Buhari Has Shown Courage, Says APC\n\nIn its reaction, the All Progressives Congress (APC) said President Buhari showed courage by signing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) 2021 into law, ending the long jinx which had seen the bill delayed since early 2000.\n\nThe National Secretary of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the economy would be the ultimate beneficiary.\n\nHe said the new legislation would overhaul the oil and gas industry. He further said it would also provide legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities as well as offer new fiscal incentives to investors.\n\nAkpanudoedehe added, \u201cThe new Petroleum Industry Act may not be a perfect document. No law anywhere in the world is a finished product. It is a good way to start, after decades of groping in the dark in the oil industry.\n\n\u201cMr. President has broken the jinx on many fronts, this is a clear demonstration of the will of a leader, determined to do the right thing. We salute the President\u2019s forthrightness and his courage to lead Nigeria right.\u201d\n\nThe secretary stressed that before now, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry used to lose as much as $15 billion in investments annually due to the delayed passage of the PIB, adding that this was about to change with the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nAkpanudoedehe argued the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) attacks of the PIA showed that the opposition party was ready to play politics with the historic feat.\n\n\u201cWe ask, what was the fate of the PIB during the wasted 16 years the PDP was in government? We will let the discerning public be the judge. Meanwhile, the APC will not get tired of righting the PDP\u2019s wrongs,\u201d he said.\n\nRivers State: 3% Allocation to N\u2019Delta Communities Meagre\n\nHowever, Wike has described the three per cent allocation for host communities in the Niger Delta region as contained in the Act as meagre.\n\nThe governor who commended the passage of the law, stated that the stipulated allocation for the host communities of oil exploitation was unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking in Port Harcourt yesterday, Wike said: \u201cWe believe that three per cent is not enough as regards the kind of pollution and environmental crisis we have had because of oil exploitation. I thought what Mr. President would have done was to tell members of National Assembly, yes, you have done what you are supposed to do, but again, you need to take into consideration the yearnings of the host communities.\u201d\n\nThe governor bemoaned the exclusion of oil producing state governments in the implementation and administration of the three per cent oil revenue recommended for host communities in the PIA.\n\nHe expressed concern that the international oil companies would take advantage of this, to continually instigate crisis in oil producing communities in order not to pay the three per cent due the host communities.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing constitutional amendment process, Wike said it was satisfying to know that such function was not an exclusive preserve of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe confidence people have today is that the amendment of the constitution will get to the states. Take for example, the federal government may not be in support of state police, but you have two-third of states that say they need state police, so in that case, state police will pass. There are issues that you may not like, but these are done on clause by clause basis.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "AFGHANISTAN: THE FUTILITY OF UNILATERAL USE OF FORCE",
          "text": "The swift takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban holds lessons for the world, writes Ikenna Emewu\n\nIn The High Cost of Peace by Yossef Bodansky in 2002, he made a statement that fits into the situation in Afghanistan this week after the Taliban overran the country shortly after the US finalized withdrawal of its troops after 20 years of humanitarian intervention.\n\nBodansky had lamented \u201cthe bitter legacy of a peace process that has cost tens of thousands of lives, emboldened such outlaw countries as Iran and Iraq, enriched Arab militaries with billions of US dollars and mobilized an underground network of terrorist cells around the globe.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, US keeps paying the high price every now and then. Again, unfortunately, it is self-inflicted cost in a show force. Most times, these interventions are not particularly for peace.\n\nFrom history, since its intervention or interference in Vietnam, US has done that 10 times and only two of them were at the mandate of the United Nations. The rest were unilateral show of force and military prowess which it often dubs as rescue missions.\n\nBut the moves are better known in international law as humanitarian interventions which actually centre on the threat and use of military force by a state on another state to enforce an intended action.\n\nIn the Vietnam theatre, after President J.F. Kennedy mobilized 16,000 soldiers to the South Asian country as military \u2018advisors\u2019 U.S stepped into full blown war in 1965 when Lyndon Johnson sent more troops after the Communist North Vietnam attacked US soldiers. It was so costly that in the late 1960s, U.S had at least 500,000 soldiers fighting in Vietnam at a whopping cost of $77b annually.\n\nThe expedition was just to contain ideological spread, so that Vietnam that had got divided into two parts after her civil war with the north communist and south capitalist would not go full-blown communist. Eventually, it ended in 1975 when US pulled out with the issues still inconclusive. Today, Vietnam is communist. Quite unfortunate.\n\nLike in Aghanistan, after America withdrew her troops in 1973, Vietnam northern forces took the city of Saigon in the south and renamed it Ho Chi Minh. The capture came as fast as Talibans did in Kabul.\n\nEvery humanitarian intervention by a state in another state with the guise of going to resolve disputes or rescue descent into human rights violations as often cited, but without the authorization of the United Nations, is a violation of international peace.\n\nThat is against the provisions of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations that: \u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nIt is only on the invocation of Chapter VII of the UN Charter that the Security Council can rely on to order measures to enforce on a state international peace and security that may come by way of economic sanctions or military actions enforced through peacekeeping.\n\nSince the Vietnam escapade, the U.S got really emboldened and hasn\u2019t looked back as it continued to Granada in 1983; Panama in 1989 with the eventual overthrow of President Manuel Noriega in January 1990; in 1990, it was Iraq that U.S invaded; Somalia in 1993; Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998. This attempt in Afghanistan was targeted at Osama bin Laden who escaped death only to unleash blood cuddling terrorism on U.S few years later. However, U.S and NATO staged another theatre in 1999.\n\nAgain in 2001, after the September 11 shocking terror attacks on U.S, in a justified retaliation, the country unleashed blistering bombardment on Afghanistan where Osama, a Saudi Arabia citizen till 1994, lived and operated from. That is the one that ended chaotically this week with the Taliban bouncing back almost immediately.\n\nIn 2003, Iraq got another dose of this U.S tradition, as the powerful country had persistently deployed drones to attack and neutralize terrorists in Somalia, Pakistan and Yemen. Libya was the next port of call in 2011. This was authorised by the UN and had NATO as part of the execution. It ended immediately Muamar Ghadaffi was killed.\n\nThe swiftness of the Talibans in retaking Afghanistan after 20 years of U.S military occupation seems to prove wrong the unilateral use of force by any single nation. That confirms the UN law against unilateralism as wise since these actions, some of them buoyed by seeming good reasons, never really enforce compliance in the involved countries or restored peace. In few of the states targeted, crises ended, yet in most others, even worse bedlams were sired and left festering as the foreign forces pulled out.\n\nToday. Afghanistan is in the grip of the Taliban again as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country unceremoniously, according to him, to avoid altercation and bloodshed. Afghanistan military offered no semblance of resistance while Taliban amassed forces.\n\nSince the U.S forces retreated according to their plan, President Joe Biden on Monday said the country was in Afghanistan to stop terrorists attacking U.S soil and not to run Afghanistan for Afghans.\n\nMany U.S citizens had over the years questioned the continued stay of the country\u2019s military in Afghanistan at huge costs to the country.\n\nThe estimation is that over 3,500 coalition soldiers died in the past 20 years in Afghanistan, and U.S with a share of about 70 percent of the number.\n\nThe BBC placed the military casualty figure of the UK at 457.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, U.S military force in Afghanistan was an average of 110,000 during which the monetary cost was some $100b a year and down to estimated $45b per year when the number of officers trickled down to 4,000 in 2020. NATO pulled out formally in 2014, but still had 13,000 troops.\n\nA Welsh mother who lost her son in the Afghanistan war campaign told BBC as Taliban retake Kabul and other cities that she shed tears because the war might have been fought in vain. Sarah Adams whose son, Pte. James Prosser, just 21 when he was killed in 2009, lamented that \u201cit is absolutely heartbreaking. I have been following it avidly and hardly slept last night thinking about it, watching it all unfolding and feel absolutely heartbroken for the Afghan people and my son, James, and all the lives that have been lost.\u201d\n\nThe emotions of this distraught mother summarises the futility of such interventions in history just like President Barack Obama later said his regret was sending U.S troops to Libya. The erstwhile powerful man on April 11, 2016 said his biggest mistake was failing to plan for the aftermath of Muammar Gaddafi ouster, a move that threw the country into chaos. The dust is yet to settle.\n\nWhereas the world would not support the Taliban type of terror on the rest of us, its spill-over spawned and emboldened other groups like the Al-Shabab in north east Africa, Boko Haram, ISWAP and more, but taking on them by foreign countries unilaterally should be thought through.\n\nThe best solution would still rest on the UN mobilizing for peacekeeping and tactical take over in order to restore planned and lasting peace.\n\nEmewu wrote from the Afri-China Media Centre, Lagos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The rest were unilateral show of force and military prowess which it often dubs as rescue missions.\nBut the moves are better known in international law as humanitarian interventions which actually centre on the threat and use of military force by a state on another state to enforce an intended action.\nThe swiftness of the Talibans in retaking Afghanistan after 20 years of U.S military occupation seems to prove wrong the unilateral use of force by any single nation.\nAfghanistan military offered no semblance of resistance while Taliban amassed forces.\nMany U.S citizens had over the years questioned the continued stay of the country\u2019s military in Afghanistan at huge costs to the country.",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture. Observers predict that with the Taliban in control, international trade will come to a standstill, leading to a surge in smuggling.\n\nThe prediction is already happening, we can see that international businesses and organisations are already closing shops and evacuating their people. Though after the capital takeover, the Taliban announced that the war is now over, can the dust settle that easily?\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for the Afghan people and the Mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years,\u201d Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office, told Al Jazeera TV.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (HURIWA) has condemned the Plateau State governor for standing by and watching in an unbelievable way as Plateau State Christians are killed, stating that, this shows weakness on the part of the state governor, Simon Lalong.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State governor Mr. Simon Lalong has indeed proven time without number to be a very weak leader of his people who have consistently come under persistent and vicious attacks against Plateau Christian native communities by armed Fulani herdsmen. The Christian communities were constantly attacked but Simon Lalong took no drastic security action not until unknown gunmen wickedly shot and killed scores of innocent Moslem travelers then he woke up from slumber exactly when the biased Presidency officials started barking like attack dogs, the Plateau State weak governor then declared a 24hours curfew but this measure did not stop the invasion of Plateau communities again for the umpteenth time by armed Fulani herdsmen who massacred many Christians.\u201d\n\nThe Rights group wondered how armed Fulani herdsmen beat the military curfew in Plateau state in the last twenty-four hours and killed many people just as the Prominent Civil Rights Advocacy group carpeted the General officer commanding 3rd division of the Nigerian Army, the Director of Department of state services, Commissioner of Police for doing nothing to prevent the renewed violence.\n\n\u201cThe Irigwe people who are hosts of the headquarters of 3rd Army division in Jos had alleged complicity between the Army Commander and the killer Fulani squads but the Federal and Plateau State administrations said nothing but the President only spoke out when some innocent Moslem travelers coming from Bauchi to Ondo were killed by unknown gunmen and this selective outrage by Federal government is despicable and reprehensible. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s outrage against the dastardly act of terror against the scores of Moslem travellers by unknown gunmen becomes ludicrous when we realise that this same President and his officials said nothing when on many occasions armed Fulani herdsmen invaded Plateau State communities and killed natives.\n\nThey equally recalled that in 2018, the Plateau State Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association justified the massacre of over 100 native Christians in Plateau State because according to them, it was a retaliation for the theft of 100 cows but President Muhammadu Buhari never ordered the arrest of this supporter of mass murder but he woke up from slumber in 2021 when some terrorists attacked innocent Moslem travelers.\n\nIt\u2019s over 18 hours since it was reported that armed marauders invaded communities in Plateau State amidst the so called curfew but we are yet to hear one word of condemnation and action from President Muhammadu Buhari\u201d.\n\nAccording to HURIWA, despite the dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed on Bassa and other two Local Government Areas, suspected herdsmen on Tuesday night killed five persons in Chando-Zrrechi (Tafi-Gana) of Miango District in Bassa Plateau State. The gunmen reportedly stormed the communities, shooting sporadically. The community leader called on security operatives and government to put a stop to the killings.\n\nHURIWA therefore, is charging the Plateau State governor to stand up, speak out and take concrete action to stop the attacks on Christians by armed Fulani herdsmen and indeed stop all attacks on citizens irrespective of their Ethno-Religious affiliation. \u201cPlateau State governor by his lacklustre approach to the genocides in Plateau State since 2015 is showing that he is a failed Chief executive of Plateau State and history and posterity will judge him harshly\u201d.\n\n...",

What we need to do is to engender citizen participation and achieve inclusiveness. Today, the ratio of citizens who pay taxes relative to the population is very, very small and the burden is only on a few persons who pay tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody who has a source of income, by law, should pay money to the state. That is what we are trying to do by ensuring that everybody pays something directly to the state government\u2019s treasury,\u201d he said.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe want to make sure that we re-energize the service. Right now, we are not meeting our budget in terms of revenue collection in the state. There are still lots of leaks. We believe that we can achieve better efficiency by restructuring the way revenue is collected in the state.\n\n\u201cThe meeting today is to meet with members of staff of EIRS, work with them and redesign the revenue collection system in the state. Before now, it was quite centralized. What we are looking at is to have a team with almost semi-independent offices across the 18 local government areas of the state that will be responsible for all the taxes that will be collected in that area.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other reform that we are looking at is to collaborate with the local government, so that we can consolidate both the taxes the local government is supposed to collect and the one accruable to the state.

The partnership was commemorated during a live virtual Memorandum of Understanding signing ceremony from Abuja and Germantown, Maryland.\n\nUnder the agreement, Earth Networks and NiMet will deploy and operate a comprehensive early warning lightning detection network in Nigeria and jointly co-market new sources of weather and lightning data to public and private industries in Nigeria. Precision weather stations and lightning sensors will be hosted at NiMet locations and maintained by NiMet staff. In addition to the network equipment, Earth Networks will also provide training and development for NiMet staff regarding use of comprehensive weather data, including real-time and historical lightning data, weather observations, sensor forecasts and live storm-tracking and alerting.\n\nThis new agreement with NiMet supports Earth Networks\u2019 commitment to build sustainable public-private weather information services partnerships with countries around the globe. Government agencies and private enterprises in Nigeria alike will now have access to a complete suite of visualization, forecasting, storm identification, alerting, and tracking services, developed and offered jointly by NiMet and Earth Networks.\n\nThis cooperation means any industry affected by weather in Nigeria, including aviation, oil and gas, mining, and manufacturing, can now take advantage of the most technologically advanced severe weather alerts and data to promote safety and ease operational challenges caused by weather.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working in more than 25 countries in Africa since 2013 to save lives and protect property with high-resolution weather and lightning data,\u201d said Jim Anderson, Vice President of Global Sales at Advanced Environmental Monitoring, Earth Networks\u2019 parent company. \u201cWe are excited to partner with NiMet to help accelerate the expansion of their high impact weather forecasting capacity and bring new weather warning services to enterprise customers in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks at the virtual MOU signing ceremony, U.S. Embassy Environment, Science, Technology, and Health Officer Adam Jagelski said the partnership between Earth Networks and NiMet will help expand Nigeria\u2019s capacity to accurately provide critical weather forecasting information and climate services, supporting Nigeria\u2019s economic development by protecting the lives and property that are critical to several key sectors.\n\n\u201cThe signing of this MOU is exemplary of the mutually beneficial partnership model U.S. businesses can employ to engage the Nigerian market,\u201d Jagelski said. \u201cI am thrilled to see Earth Networks using the partnership model to bring the expertise of one of America\u2019s truly innovative companies to the strategic infrastructure sector in Nigeria.

          "text": "The outpouring of disgust that trailed the assault on a Nigerian diplomat serving in Jakarta, Indonesia, has again raised questions about Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic engagements with the rest of the world. Nigerian diplomat, Abdul Ibrahim was seen on a viral video almost being strangled by Indonesian immigration officials for allegedly moving in the streets without identification.\n\nThe Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and the public have condemned the despicable behaviour and registered their displeasure by summoning the Indonesian Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr Usra Hendra Harahap, who has apologised on behalf of his country, promising that his country will investigate the issue. The Nigerian Ambassador to Indonesia, Usman Ogah has also been invited home for more consultation.\n\nHowever, experts have said that Nigeria needs to take more drastic action because the assault contravened the Vienna Convention.\n\nFormer Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and one time Nigerian envoy to Ethiopia, Ambassador Bulus Lolo, described the action of the Indonesian officials as \u2018barbaric\u2019, even as he urged the government to work towards improving the image of Nigeria, which has been battered over the years.\n\nApart from the diplomat that was assaulted, there are increasing cases of other Nigerians who have also been so badly treated as a result of misbehaviour in some cases. To this, Lolo says our behaviour must be such that people will respect us. He also attributed maltreatment of Nigerians to the desperate economic situation of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmbassador Ogbole Ode, former Nigeria\u2019s Acting High Commissioner to Singapore, said that Nigeria\u2019 image around the world has so deteriorated that the country is becoming irrelevant due to dwindling economic fortunes of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, what that translates into our foreign policy posture is that our foreign policy has been on the decline in terms of formulation, execution and consequences. We are increasingly becoming irrelevant compared to the 60s and 70s,\u201d he said.\n\nHe however, denounced the mistreatment of the Nigerian diplomat, adding that Indonesia failed to abide by the Vienna Convention on diplomatic and consular relations, which the two countries are signatory to. He said that if the Indonesian authorities do not provide satisfactory answers to this assault, Nigeria must apply the same measures to Indonesia. This provocative development grossly falls short of the standard of treatment deserving of a Nigerian not to talk of a Diplomat.\n\nThis raises too many questions about the fast fading stature of Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic image and value in the international plane coupled with the many cases of assault against other Nigerians in many countries of the world including Africa, with references made to Ghana and South Africa.\n\nAccording to an expert, Livingston Wechie, treatment of Nigerians abroad is not unconnected to the disdainful treatment that Nigerians are subjected to by their own country, adding that the way a state treats her citizens is a mirror and a reflection of how foreign states will treat such citizens.",

          "text": "Last Monday, President Goodluck Jonathan described the late Patrick Sawyer, who brought the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) to Nigeria, as a mad man. Good talk sir. But do we blame Sawyer, the Liberian-American, for the troubled times Nigerians are living in now?\n\nFrom findings so far, the disease has high mortality rate, killing about 90 per cent of those infected with the virus. Because its lethality is swift, we must commend the Federal Government and the Lagos State Government for the way they have contained it so far. Honestly, kudos must be given to Jonathan and Governor Babatunde Fashola. But is Ebola responsible for the blood we have everywhere in the country today?\n\nAccording to experts, this disease first afflicted people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then known as Zaire) in 1976. For years, it disappeared, then re-appeared and disappeared again. Now, it has appeared again with such ferocity that it has killed close to 1,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It has also claimed three victims in Nigeria.\n\nA friend called me from the United States last week and said that it may be difficult for Nigeria to identify types of the virus because we only have Level 3 Virology Laboratories. To him, we need Biosafety Level 4 Laboratories to tackle the disease effectively.\n\nBecause I failed science subjects in secondary school, I didn\u2019t really understand what he was saying. But one thing is sure, Nigerians\u2019 eternal resilience will stop the spread of this deadly Ebola virus. In any crisis situation, Nigerians have been tested and trusted and we have never failed.\n\nBut after the stoppage of this disease, what happens to other \u2018more dangerous\u2019 Ebolas which have been ravaging the land for years and threatening not only individuals but the existence of this country?\n\nFor decades, political, social, economic, religious and cultural Ebolas have been killing Nigerians. In fact, some Nigerians derive joy when all these Ebolas annihilate their fellow beings. These have become a cankerworm, eating deep into the very foundation of the value system of this country.\n\nAs usual, the frenzy with which Nigerians react to a \u2018clear and present danger\u2019 is predictable. Everybody will become an expert overnight, dishing out instructions to fellow Nigerians on what should or should not be done not to fall victim.\n\nRumour becomes the order of the day and the rumour monger automatically becomes the new messiah.\n\nI remember in July, 1999 when the first Speaker of the House of Representatives of the new democratic dispensation, Salisu Buhari, was removed, I boarded a commercial bus in Ijora, Lagos on my way to cover an assignment when discussion on the sacked Speaker started.\n\nThere was this middle-aged man who immediately became the rallying point for other passengers. What he was dishing out was far from the truth. It got to a stage when he said \u201cI don\u2019t know how the father of Salisu Buhari would be feeling right now\u201d.\n\nConfidently, he told the passengers that the father was Major-General Muhammadu Buhari. With the composure of every other passenger, I was the only one who knew this man was just blabbing. I told him that Salisu was from Kano while General Buhari hails from Katsina but he just said: \u201cYou this small boy, what do you know?\u201d At that point, I knew it was useless trying to argue with him because the other illiterate passengers believed him.\n\nThe same talebearers are at work now and that is why many Nigerians may die from panic and misinformation than the Ebola disease itself.\n\nMy younger brother, Micaiah, an undergraduate in Lagos State University (LASU), told me an incident that happened near his hostel last Saturday when a mother almost killed her children. Why? They refused to have their bath with salty water.\n\nBecause of misinformation widely circulated through social media, some people dipped themselves in warm salty water and even drinking same so as not to contract the disease.\n\nI listened to a comedian last Monday who said a man, after eating in a restaurant in Oshodi, Lagos, started coughing and told everybody that he had Ebola. Immediately, other customers disappeared but the owner of the restaurant suspected that it was a ploy by the man not to pay. She told him: \u201cEven if you are the real Ebola, I go chop you and nothing will happen. If you don\u2019t pay my money now, I will beat the hell out of you\u201d.\n\nOf course, when the area boys descended on the man, he paid promptly.\n\nFrom the sublime to the ridiculous, rumour spreads very fast during emergencies and some Nigerians will always take advantage of this.\n\nObviously, this Ebola menace will go soon but what of the other Ebolas?\n\nWhich Ebola disease could be deadlier than what happened in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State last Saturday when newly-born twins were stolen and the parents murdered?\n\nThe twins were stolen not for adoption but for ritual purpose. This seems to be the latest in town now: Abduct newly-born twins and you will become instant millionaire.\n\nHow many Nigerians have died in the hands of these \u2018Ebolaritualists\u2019?\n\nThree days after Titilayo Kola gave birth to the twins, she and her husband were murdered at their Temidire Street, Ajowa Quarters, Ado-Ekiti and the babies stolen.\n\nWhile Titilayo was killed in their room, the husband\u2019s body was dumped inside a canal in Oke-Ila area of the town.\n\nThe Ekiti State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Victor Babayemi, described it as a case of homicide and child stealing. How many such cases do we have in the country today? Is this per-second killing of Nigerians by Nigerians not worse than the Ebola disease? Violence is now so cheap that when it happens, Nigerians just dismiss it with a shrug. Senseless killings have now become the order of the day. A day after Governor Rauf Aregbesola was declared the winner of the August 9 election in Osun State, supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) clashed, leaving many injured. It is as if the country is demonised.\n\nWhat of lack of constant electricity supply? Power outage has ebolarised many Nigerians more than any disease. It is now normal for Nigerians not to expect electricity. From ECN, NEPA, PHCN to GENCOs AND DISCOs, nothing good has come out of the transformation of electricity bodies in the country. The other time, some funny workers in one of the DISCOs or GENCOs threatened to go on strike and Nigerians did not bother to comment. Even when Power Minister, Chinedu Nebo, announced a drop in the mewagatts generated, the reaction was that he was not saying something new.\n\nThat Nigerians still refer to electricity companies as NEPA shows the level of disconnect between effective power distribution and consumers.\n\nHow many Nigerians have been killed by another Ebola called bad roads? These days, Nigerians don\u2019t even complain anymore. What they do is just to manage the craters on these roads.\n\nWhat of unemployment? Is it not deadlier than Ebola disease? What is being done by the government to cure this jobless Ebola ravaging the land for decades?\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ogun State government suspended its plan to recruit 3,000 environmental marshals across the state following excessive applications received for the exercise.\n\nGovernor Ibikunle Amosun said that no fewer than 49,000 applications were received and of the applicants, there were some PhD holders and over 600 Master\u2019s degree holders.\n\nFor PhD holders to apply to be sweeping streets, which Ebola disease could be more lethal than this?\n\nAmosun said: \u201c\u201dIf we have about 600 of those with Master\u2019s qualification and above running around for a job that they would be paid N20,000, then you know that there is a problem. Head or tail, even by the time we employ those 3,000, the remaining 46,000 that will not be taken, people will say they\u2019ve taken forms, Amosun did not employ them, he just asked them to come and take forms. Look at that huge deficit that we have.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just in Ogun State. What is the government doing to tackle this unemployment crisis ravaging the land called Ebola? Given the fact that the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) test tragedy is still fresh, what can be done to optimally develop agriculture, technical education, the real sector and cottage industries?\n\nWhat is the way out for this Ebolarised generation?\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Everybody will become an expert overnight, dishing out instructions to fellow Nigerians on what should or should not be done not to fall victim.\n\nRumour becomes the order of the day and the rumour monger automatically becomes the new messiah.\n\nI remember in July, 1999 when the first Speaker of the House of Representatives of the new democratic dispensation, Salisu Buhari, was removed, I boarded a commercial bus in Ijora, Lagos on my way to cover an assignment when discussion on the sacked Speaker started.\n\nThere was this middle-aged man who immediately became the rallying point for other passengers. What he was dishing out was far from the truth. It got to a stage when he said \u201cI don\u2019t know how the father of Salisu Buhari would be feeling right now\u201d.\n\nConfidently, he told the passengers that the father was Major-General Muhammadu Buhari. With the composure of every other passenger, I was the only one who knew this man was just blabbing. I told him that Salisu was from Kano while General Buhari hails from Katsina but he just said: \u201cYou this small boy, what do you know?\u201d At that point, I knew it was useless trying to argue with him because the other illiterate passengers believed him.\n\nThe same talebearers are at work now and that is why many Nigerians may die from panic and misinformation than the Ebola disease itself.\n\nMy younger brother, Micaiah, an undergraduate in Lagos State University (LASU), told me an incident that happened near his hostel last Saturday when a mother almost killed her children. Why? They refused to have their bath with salty water.\n\nBecause of misinformation widely circulated through social media, some people dipped themselves in warm salty water and even drinking same so as not to contract the disease.\n\nI listened to a comedian last Monday who said a man, after eating in a restaurant in Oshodi, Lagos, started coughing and told everybody that he had Ebola. Immediately, other customers disappeared but the owner of the restaurant suspected that it was a ploy by the man not to pay. She told him: \u201cEven if you are the real Ebola, I go chop you and nothing will happen. If you don\u2019t pay my money now, I will beat the hell out of you\u201d.\n\nOf course, when the area boys descended on the man, he paid promptly.\n\nFrom the sublime to the ridiculous, rumour spreads very fast during emergencies and some Nigerians will always take advantage of this.\n\nObviously, this Ebola menace will go soon but what of the other Ebolas?\n\nWhich Ebola disease could be deadlier than what happened in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State last Saturday when newly-born twins were stolen and the parents murdered?\n\nThe twins were stolen not for adoption but for ritual purpose. This seems to be the latest in town now: Abduct newly-born twins and you will become instant millionaire.\n\nHow many Nigerians have died in the hands of these \u2018Ebolaritualists\u2019?\n\nThree days after Titilayo Kola gave birth to the twins, she and her husband were murdered at their Temidire Street, Ajowa Quarters, Ado-Ekiti and the babies stolen.\n\nWhile Titilayo was killed in their room, the husband\u2019s body was dumped inside a canal in Oke-Ila area of the town.\n\nThe Ekiti State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Victor Babayemi, described it as a case of homicide and child stealing. How many such cases do we have in the country today? Is this per-second killing of Nigerians by Nigerians not worse than the Ebola disease? Violence is now so cheap that when it happens, Nigerians just dismiss it with a shrug. Senseless killings have now become the order of the day. A day after Governor Rauf Aregbesola was declared the winner of the August 9 election in Osun State, supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) clashed, leaving many injured. It is as if the country is demonised.\n\nWhat of lack of constant electricity supply? Power outage has ebolarised many Nigerians more than any disease. It is now normal for Nigerians not to expect electricity. From ECN, NEPA, PHCN to GENCOs AND DISCOs, nothing good has come out of the transformation of electricity bodies in the country. The other time, some funny workers in one of the DISCOs or GENCOs threatened to go on strike and Nigerians did not bother to comment. Even when Power Minister, Chinedu Nebo, announced a drop in the mewagatts generated, the reaction was that he was not saying something new.\n\nThat Nigerians still refer to electricity companies as NEPA shows the level of disconnect between effective power distribution and consumers.\n\nHow many Nigerians have been killed by another Ebola called bad roads? These days, Nigerians don\u2019t even complain anymore. What they do is just to manage the craters on these roads.\n\nWhat of unemployment? Is it not deadlier than Ebola disease? What is being done by the government to cure this jobless Ebola ravaging the land for decades?\n\nOn Tuesday, the Ogun State government suspended its plan to recruit 3,000 environmental marshals across the state following excessive applications received for the exercise.\n\nGovernor Ibikunle Amosun said that no fewer than 49,000 applications were received and of the applicants, there were some PhD holders and over 600 Master\u2019s degree holders.\n\nFor PhD holders to apply to be sweeping streets, which Ebola disease could be more lethal than this?\n\nAmosun said: \u201c\u201dIf we have about 600 of those with Master\u2019s qualification and above running around for a job that they would be paid N20,000, then you know that there is a problem. Head or tail, even by the time we employ those 3,000, the remaining 46,000 that will not be taken, people will say they\u2019ve taken forms, Amosun did not employ them, he just asked them to come and take forms. Look at that huge deficit that we have.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just in Ogun State. What is the government doing to tackle this unemployment crisis ravaging the land called Ebola? Given the fact that the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) test tragedy is still fresh, what can be done to optimally develop agriculture, technical education, the real sector and cottage industries?\n\nWhat is the way out for this Ebolarised generation?\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
          "summary": "Last Monday, President Goodluck Jonathan described the late Patrick Sawyer, who brought the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) to Nigeria, as a mad man.\nBecause its lethality is swift, we must commend the Federal Government and the Lagos State Government for the way they have contained it so far.\nBut one thing is sure, Nigerians\u2019 eternal resilience will stop the spread of this deadly Ebola virus.\nIs this per-second killing of Nigerians by Nigerians not worse than the Ebola disease?\nFor PhD holders to apply to be sweeping streets, which Ebola disease could be more lethal than this?",

Enough is enough, I will no longer take any of this in our Kingdom,\u201d he said.\n\nComrade Amos Ehinomen Uagbor said: \u201cIs this obtainable elsewhere ?\n\nWe should now have OBA and Sultan in Edo state ? Infact, the venue should be sealed`\u2019.\n\nEfforts to reach mobile phones numbers on the card for a reaction failed, as calls made to them failed to connect.\n\nP.M.News believes that the planned installation of Idriss Adanno as Sultan of Shuwa Arab may be a response to the turbanning of Adam Harun for the same title by the Shehu of Borno.\n\nOn 4 August, the Shehu of Borno, Dr Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai Al\u2019amin Elkanemi, performed the ceremony in Maiduguri.\n\nThat some Shuwa Arabs are staging another show, less than three weeks after, is indicative of a division amidst the Shuwa Arabs living in Edo State.",

          "text": "The Joe Biden administration has placed a freeze on Afghan government funds held in US bank accounts.\n\nAccording to two persons familiar with the situation, this directive prevented the Taliban from accessing billions of money kept in US banks.\n\nAn administration official said Tuesday that the US froze roughly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank and halted cash shipments to the country in an effort to prevent a Taliban-led government from receiving the funds.\n\nAccording to the person, any central bank assets held by the Afghan government in the United States will not be available to the Taliban, which is still on the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions list.\n\nOn Monday, Ajmal Ahmady, the acting CEO of Da Afghan Bank (DAB), the country\u2019s central bank, tweeted that he learnt on Friday that dollar shipments would be halted as the US attempted to prevent the Taliban from gaining access to the funds. DAB\u2019s assets are $9.5 billion, with a large portion of that in accounts with the New York Federal Reserve and other US-based financial institutions.\n\nThe Taliban are unable to obtain finances due to US sanctions. According to two people acquainted with the situation, the great majority of DAB\u2019s assets are not now held in Afghanistan.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and officials from the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, according to the Washington Post, made the decision.\n\nOver the weekend, the State Department was thought to be participating in conversations, with White House officials keeping an eye on the situation.\n\n\u201cAny Central Bank assets the Afghan government has in the United States would not be made available to the Taliban,\u201d an administration official said in a statement.\n\nThe officials talked on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss unreleased government policy.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Afghanistan\u2019s central bank had $9.4 billion in reserve assets as of April. This represents around a third of the country\u2019s annual economic output. According to one source acquainted with the situation, the great majority of such reserves are not currently kept in Afghanistan. Among them, the United States holds billions of dollars, albeit the exact quantity is unknown.\n\nWhite House and Treasury Department spokespeople declined to comment on the procedure for withholding the payments or the future of US aid to Afghanistan. A spokesperson with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is said to be holding bulk of the money, likewise declined to comment.",

The N4.973 trillion unsubstantiated balances are above the materiality level of N89.34 billion set for the Audit.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIn auditing, materiality means not just a quantified amount, but the effect that amount will have in various contexts. During the auditing planning process, the auditor decides what the level of materiality will be, taking into account the entirety of the financial statements to be audited.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the auditor-general said required queries were issued against agencies found to be involved in the infractions.\n\nHe told the CAN, who was represented by Deputy Clerk to the National Assembly (DCNA) Bala Yabani that auditing of consolidated financial statement of the federal government on yearly basis, would be expeditiously carried out as made available by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that on the 25th of March this year, Audit of Consolidated Financial Statement of the Federal Government for the 2018 was submitted to this office for the required investigation of queries raised in it by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cJust five months after, we are here again to make submission of the 2019 Audit Report,\u201d Aghughu also said.\n\nHe, however, lamented that his office was not working the way it should due to myriad of factors crippling its operations, thus giving room for all forms of financial infractions across the various MDAs.\n\n\u201cOne of such problems is the absence of Federal Audit Service Law which is a big challenge as far as effective and efficient public sector auditing is concerned.\n\n\u201cThis is a law that is needed as basis of fiscal sustainability. Absence of it at the federal level is very worrisome going by the fact that some of the states of the Federation have the required law in place.\n\n\u201cAnother problem incapacitating optimal functionality of our mandate as far as thorough and appropriate auditing of financial statements of the MDAs are concerned, is gross underfunding which is telling much on our efficiency.\n\n\u201cFor example, the office is understaffed but there is no money for recruitment. Imagine many of our state offices, having just two or three staff. Auditing is done by a team not by an individual.\n\n\u201cAccommodation is also part of the problem as our staff in Lagos are about to be evicted from their office due to litigations.\n\n\u201cThese are aside problem of insecurity seriously affecting our scope of coverage,\u201d he lamented.\n\nReceiving the report, DCNA Yabani said the report would be submitted to the CNA for onward submission to both Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila for the required legislative consideration.\n\nHe added that all the complaints made by the AGF would be tabled before the leadership of the National Assembly for required actions and solutions.\n\n\u201cYour complaints are very germane. They will surely be conveyed to the appropriate quarters that will surely do the needful on them because the people heading the quarters have listening ears,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Following the uncertainty that for long surrounded the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and the consequent lack of progress and stagnation in the industry, Nigeria lost an estimated $50 billion worth of investments in 10 years, President Muhammadu Buhari has said.\n\nBuhari spoke Wednesday at a brief ceremony to celebrate the signing of the Bill into an Act shortly before the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nHe said the stagnation stunted the nation\u2019s economic growth and its prosperity.\n\nThe president cited lack of political will on the part of past administrations to actualise the needed transformation.\n\nWith the Act, Buhari said, the decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry were gone.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that past Administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was lack of political will to actualise this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past ten years, Nigeria has lost an estimated US$50 billion worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our Nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our Administration has found it necessary to work with the two Chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari further said signing the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investment, improve our revenue base, create jobs and support our economic diversification agenda.\n\nHe said as a \u201cnation that depends on oil resources for the development of other sectors, Nigeria runs a Petroleum Industry that is governed largely by laws enacted over 50 years ago such as the principal legislation; the Petroleum Act of 1969 and other obsolete legislations.\u201d\n\nBuhari further said the transition of the bill to \u201cPetroleum Industry Act 2021\u201d marked the beginning of the journey towards a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that would attract investments to support the nation\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act 2021 creates a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of Host Communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the administration believes that the timely passage of the PIB \u201cwill help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\u201d\n\nDirects implementation\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the president urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nPresident Buhari said the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, would head the implementation team, urging all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition, designed to reposition the economy.\n\n\u201cTo consolidate the commitment of this administration to delivering the value proposition of this law, I have approved an implementation framework commencing immediately to ensure the industry envisaged in the new law begins to take shape.\n\n\u201cThe implementation process to be headed by the Hon Minister of State, Petroleum Resources is hereby tasked with the completion of the implementation of this act within 12 months. I am therefore directing all relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to fully cooperate in ensuring the successful and timely implementation of this law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commended the leadership of the 9th Assembly for their continued pursuit of national aspiration and demonstration of mutual harmony with the Executive in the pursuit of patriotic outcome in passage of PIB.\n\n\u201cI also commend the entire team in the executive that worked tirelessly to ensure the delivery of this strategic legislation for our country. I thank Nigerians and other industry stakeholders for their contributions and support in achieving this historic landmark,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Senate President Dr. Ahmed Lawan, Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy Speaker House of Representatives Ahmed Idris Wase and other lawmakers, members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari.\n\nNames implementation committee\n\nMeanwhile, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, has announced members of the steering committee to be headed by Mr Sylva.\n\nOther members are: Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Executive Chairman, FIRS, Representative of the Ministry of Justice, Representative of the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Natural Resources, Olufemi Lijadu as External Legal Adviser, while the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund serves as Head of the Coordinating Secretariat and the Implementation Working Group.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe primary responsibility of the steering committee shall be to guide the effective and timely implementation of the PIA in the course of transition to the petroleum industry envisaged in the reform program, and ensure that the new institutions created have the full capability to deliver on their mandate under the new legislation.\u201d\n\nThe committee has 12-month duration for the assignment during which periodic updates would be given to Mr President, Adesina stated.\n\n\u20183% to host communities recipe for crises\u2019\n\nBut Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike has said the provision for direct disbursement of 3 percent to host communities in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is a recipe for sustained communal conflicts which would eventually negate whatever good the federal government had intended to achieve with the provision.\n\nThe governor also said without a legal machinery to manage both the identification of host communities and disbursement and distribution of funds due to the beneficiaries, they would be thrown into unnecessary wrangling.\n\nWhile acknowledging the courage of the 9th National Assembly to eventually pass the PIB and the consequent presidential assent, the governor however picked holes in the Act.\n\nHe said the failure to establish a legal machinery to manage the funds would set the stage for untoward controversies among the communities and the International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television programme (Politics Today) Tuesday evening, the governor said the IOCs would exploit the loopholes to deny the host communities their entitlements as prescribed by the Act.\n\nWike said by the Act, the IOCs have the powers to define who gets what and also administer the funds to those they were willing to identify.\n\n\u201cThe 3 percent will be paid directly to the host communities to manage. Besides, the government and the operators (IOCs) will identify the host communities. Now, who defines who a host community is? The operator. How can a businessman define who his host community is? I believe that is wrong.\n\n\u201cThis could pose a problem because I have seen IOCs deliberately put the heads of two communities together to create crises in order not to meet its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the communities and turned up to argue that because the communities are at loggerheads they can\u2019t do what they signed in the MoU with the community.\n\n\u201cEven in terms of managing this fund, it will create a problem knowing the acts of these IOCs. They will sponsor factions in the community to make sure they don\u2019t pay 3 percent to the community; make some go to court for all sorts of frivolities and turn round to say \u2018we have court injunction not to release the money\u2019. As a council chairman and now state governor, I know the antecedents of the IOCs in this regard.\n\n\u201cIn fact, in some cases the IOCs have sponsored chieftaincy tussles in order not to carry out their responsibilities to the communities. I was thinking that the government would have a hand in order to monitor the spending of such funds,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor further said \u201cpaying the money directly to any host community and leaving it alone to manage the fund will cause a lot of crises. There should be something to checkmate the communities. A provision for a board to monitor the disbursement of the fund would have been adequate.\u201d\n\nHe further said the president ought to have consulted widely before assenting to the bill, saying such consultation would have enabled him identify the loopholes as well as address the inadequacy of the 3 percent provided.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives passed 5 percent and the Senate 3 percent. I thought the president should have seen that the amount is not enough to tackle the issue of environmental pollution. How do you reconcile this, you are giving the host communities 3 percent and giving frontier states 30 percent for the exploration of crude oil?\n\n\u201cYou have explored and got oil in an environment and in doing that they have environmental crises and you make provision for 3 percent to the host communities and then you allocate 30 percent from the purse of the NNPC to the frontier states to go explore for oil, how do you balance it?\u201d the governor queried.\n\nHe said a careful consideration of the plight of the people of Niger Delta could have engendered a statesmanship in him, and not playing politics with such sensitive issue.",

          "text": "Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has highlighted that like in other sectors, the challenge of poor and non-proactive leadership has reduced the impact of Trade Unions across sectors in the country.\n\nThis, he said has contributed to a lack of trust by members and wrong strategies by union leaders in addressing the myriads of issues that regularly call for attention.\n\nThe minister who made this assertion on Wednesday at a two-day Strategic Workshop on Industrial Harmony by the Joint Aviation Trade Unions Forum in Owerri, Imo State, thus noted that the solution is to ensure that only \u201cqualified, tested, and trusted leaders who are true workers should be voted into leadership positions at the local, state, and national level\u201d.\n\nSirika who was represented by James Odaoudu, Director Public Affairs of the Ministry, harped that it is only leaders with integrity that will have the courage to face employers objectively and call their members to order when things go wrong.\n\n\u201cIn addition, union leaders should be properly trained and educated to know the basic labour laws to plan their actions within the confine of the laws to avoid pursuing shadows while leaving the substance, especially during collective bargaining and conflict resolution engagements.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will continue to support the involvement of union leaders and workers in our policy and decision-making processes. This is because, when issues arise at the workplace between managers and the employee, union representatives remain the channels to secure \u201cwin-win\u201d situations in which both sides feel as if they each attained something from the deal,\u201d he added.\n\nSirika advised that it has become imperative for unionists, especially in the aviation sector to firm up, given the fact that the sector has \u201centered the critical stage of the implementation of our aviation sector development roadmap, we need all hands on deck to ensure its success. Only an environment of industrial harmony can guarantee that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigerian aviation sector, I dare say that the various labour unions have tried to play this role effectively. This role enables labour unions to ensure that cordial and good understanding between employers and employees could be established in the workplace and leads to a harmonious and conducive working environment. It is such an environment that results in higher organizational and individual productivity,\u201d Sirika added.",

          "text": "Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Maigari Dingyadi has disclosed a plan by the federal government to offer admission to intending Sierra Leone Police officers to acquire more strategic courses on policing at the Nigerian Institute of Police Studies and other institutions.\n\nDingyadi who spoke during a courtesy call by the Sierra Leone delegate led by the Minister of Interior, David Maurice Panda-Noah, and the Inspector General of Police, IGP Ambrose Sovula at the ministry\u2019s headquarters in Abuja, noted that such synergy between Nigeria and Sierra Leone would enhance the efficiency of rank and files of Police to secure West African region.\n\nThe minister, while recalling that both countries had experienced civil war and now facing security challenges, believes that collaboration between the Police Force of both countries would enable their personnel to secure the region.\n\n\u201cWe are going to support one another, and we will continue to make an effort to update and improve on police equipment and gadgets of the Police Force,\u201d he assured.\n\nDingyadi, a\u00e7cording to a statement issued by the ministry\u2019s Head of Press and Public Relations, Bolaji O. Kazeem, stressed the need to strengthen the security architecture of both countries and support the Sierra Leone Police Force with more opportunities for training facilities in Nigeria, noting that they have enjoyed brotherhood and togetherness from time immemorial.\n\nHe said, \u201cin addition to the National Institute of Police Studies, we have other police colleges around the country that can train intermediate officers. The Inspector-General of Police can facilitate admission of Sierra Leone youths into the police training schools in the country.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Sierra Leone Minister of Interior revealed that the President of his country has flagged off his star project in the area of human capital development which necessitated the idea of sending some Police officers to attend the \u201cStrategic Leadership Training Course\u201d at the Nigerian Institute of Police Studies, adding that the President endorsed their attendance of the graduation ceremony coming up today (Thursday).\n\nPanda-Noah stressed the urgent need for African countries to unite, synergize and collaborate in order to combat transnational challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cAfrica has their own unique problems which only Africans can solve. Supporting one another is key to tackling the challenges which have bedeviled Africa and the world at large. The collaboration is very important to us and would enable our officers to have a seamless understanding of how to curb crimes in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the people of Sierra Leone would never forget the help rendered by Nigeria about two decades ago to overcome the civil war in his country.",

          "title": "Nigeria Lost $50bn In 10 Years Due To Uncertainty Over Petroleum Industry \u2013 Buhari",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday in Abuja said Nigeria lost an estimated $50billion worth of investments in 10 years.\n\nThis, according to him, was a result of the uncertainty of the non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), lack of progress and stagnation in the petroleum industry.\n\nIn his remarks at a ceremony on passage of the PIA, which preceded the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, the President said the stagnation affected the growth of the economy, citing lack of political will on the part of past administrations to actualize the needed transformation.\n\nPresident Buhari said assent of the Petroleum Industry Bill on August 16, 2021, marked the end of decades of uncertainty and under-investment in the petroleum industry.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that past administrations have identified the need to further align the industry for global competitiveness, but there was a lack of political will to actualize this needed transformation.\n\n\u201cThis lack of progress has stagnated the growth of the industry and the prosperity of our economy. In the past ten years, Nigeria has lost an estimated US$50billion worth of investments due to uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help our country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\n\u201cIn view of the value our Nation and investors will derive from a stable fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry, our Administration has found it necessary to work with the two chambers of the National Assembly to ensure the passage of the PIB,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to a statement by his special media aide, Femi Adesina, the President noted that the signing of the bill was part of the administration\u2019s commitment to building a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that will attract investment, improve the country\u2019s revenue base, create jobs and support the economic diversification agenda.\n\nRead Also: Buhari Approves Committee To Implement Petroleum Industry Act Immediately\n\nPresident Buhari said as a \u201cnation that depends on oil resources for the development of other sectors, Nigeria runs a Petroleum Industry that is governed largely by laws enacted over 50 years ago such as the principal legislation; the Petroleum Act of 1969 and other obsolete legislations.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the Presidential assent of the bill to \u201cPetroleum Industry Act 2021\u201d marked the beginning of the journey towards a competitive and resilient petroleum industry that will attract investments to support the nation\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Petroleum Industry Act 2021\u2019 creates a regulatory environment that would ensure efficiency and accountability across the oil and gas value chain and reposition NNPC to a commercially driven National Petroleum Company that is accountable to the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe Act also provides for a direct benefit framework that will enable sustainable development of host communities. I appeal to the host communities to look carefully at the contents of the Bill which in the implementation will bring real and lasting benefits to them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Act provides for deliberate end to gas flaring which would facilitate the attainment of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement through a funding mechanism to support gas flare out project in host communities,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the administration believes that the timely passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will help the country attract investments across the oil and gas value chain.\n\nWhile directing immediate implementation of the framework for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), he urged all relevant stakeholders to comply and reposition for full activation within 12 months.\n\nThe President said the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, will head the implementation team, urging all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) to adjust to the transition, designed to reposition the economy.\n\n\u201cTo consolidate the commitment of this administration to delivering the value proposition of this law, I have approved an implementation framework commencing immediately to ensure the industry envisaged in the new law begins to take shape.\n\n\u201cThe implementation process to be headed by the Hon Minister of State, Petroleum Resources is hereby tasked with the completion of the implementation of this act within 12 months. I am, therefore, directing all relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to fully cooperate in ensuring the successful and timely implementation of this law,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari commended the leadership of the 9th Assembly for what he described as their continued pursuit of national aspiration and demonstration of mutual harmony with the executive in the pursuit of patriotic outcome in the passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cI also commend the entire team in the executive that worked tirelessly to ensure the delivery of this strategic legislation for our country. I thank Nigerians and other industry stakeholders for their contributions and support in achieving this historic landmark,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, Deputy Speaker Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase and other lawmakers, members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari.",

          "text": "Christian organization under the auspices of Christian Solidarity Worldwide Nigeria (CSWN) said the violators of kidnapped Chibok girls, Ruth Ngladar Pogu and Hassana Adamu, who were found with children several years after they were kidnapped should be made to face the full wrath of the law.\n\nThe group in a statement signed by its Research and Press Officer, Mr Reuben Buhari, said \u201cafter seven years in forceful, dehumanising and unlawful captivity, two abducted students of the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno state have been found.\n\nRecall that the school was invaded on April 14, 2014, by Boko Haram Terrorists and 276 girls were taken away. Some escaped, some died and about 100 are still missing.\u201d\n\nReuben Buhari , however, expressed joy on what he called promising good news that holds the prospect of more girls getting their freedom, adding that first it was Ruth Ngladar Pogu and the man erroneously referred to as her \u2018husband\u2019 who presented themselves to the security on July 28, 2021, in Bama, then on Saturday, July 14, 2021, Hassana Adamu was also found with two children in Gwoza.\n\nTVC NEWS reports that both girls were found with children from their abductors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Christian organisation stated that, \u201cour concern stems from the fundamental human rights of these girls that were willfully violated. They were forcefully abducted from their school when they were preparing to write an exam.\n\n\u201cAfter being taken away from their families, friends and society, they were forcefully and unlawfully given off to terrorists who were part of those who denied them their right to education in the first place.\n\n\u201cWhile CSWN is happy that the two girls were reunited with their parents, it has, however, become a great concern to us on the careless use of the terminology \u2013 \u2018husband\u2019, in describing those that forced themselves on these girls and eventually sired children with them.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening and insensitive to the victims to describe the terrorists as their husbands. These characters have committed terrorism, rape, murder, abduction, forced marriage, gender violence and destruction of properties among other crimes against the Nigerian state, including a violation of the fundamental human rights of these girls and others.\n\n\u201cThey have suffered unimaginable violations of their rights for seven years with debilitating impact on their future. Their parents have gone through excruciating pains, with some even dying from the trauma of having their children abducted, and these infractions stand in stark contrast to the ideals of freedom that the Nigerian constitution guarantees them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government may continue with its re-radicalisation programme that birthed the worrying terminology of \u2018repentant terrorists, but we in CSWN, in view of the fact that Nigeria is governed by laws, call for the full application of all relevant laws on those who violated these girls. This would show the supremacy of law over lawlessness and impunity, and a consolation to the victims of insurgency trying to rebuild their lives or still wallowing in IDP camps.\u201d\n\nCSWN also called on the Federal Government to take the full responsibility of rehabilitating the freed girls as a measure of its commitment to the enthronement of a decent society that Nigeria aspires live in.",
