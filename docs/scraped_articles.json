          "text": "Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello has said he went into the race for the presidency in 2023 under the All Progressives Congress, APC, just to hone his skills as a politician.\n\nAlthough he lost out in the primary election that produced former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu as presidential flag bearer, Bello said the lessons learnt from the contest has been well assimilated and will prove useful in future political endeavours.\n\nThe Governor made these remarks, shortly after he met President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, to thank him for allowing a level playing ground for all the contestants during the recent primary polls.\n\nRecall that while the permutations for who will emerge as flag bearer of the ruling party raged, Bello had remained adamant that he would not step down for any candidate.\n\nHe was reported to have walked out on one of the stakeholders meetings involving the APC Governors from the North and had insisted that it would take only the President to compel him to step down for any of the aspirants.\n\nHe was later seen visiting Tinubu to declare his full support for his presidential ambition and even donated a fully furnished campaign office to aid the presidential flagbearer.\n\n\u201cI came today to see Mr. President to express my appreciation for allowing me to participate in the just concluded national special convention that elected our standard bearer. As a president, the leader of our party, my leader, my father, and mentor.\n\n\u201cI deem it necessary and courteous enough to come and appreciate him for giving me that opportunity. Even so far, to serve the good people of Kogi State as executive governor the first and even in the second term so far, and in various capacities that have served the party, my state and the nation And to further express to Mr. President, I am 100% loyal to him and to the party. And Mr. President was pleased. He appreciated me and encouraged me to continue to pursue what will make this country great. So basically, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\n\n\u201cYou can start from any level, as a youth, as women; as Nigerians, you can start from any level. My own first level is governorship, and God made it. And again, I attempted the presidency, now, let us not give up hope. We must continue to try. I have learned a great lesson from this first trial. And I\u2019m never beaten twice,\u201d he stated.\n\nCommenting on the clamour for a Muslim/Muslim ticket, he said Tinubu was an experienced politician, hence would know how to pick a running mate that would give him the edge to win the elections.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe flagbearer, Senator to Bola Ahmed Tinubu is an astute politician. He understands the game well and he knows how to win a contest, especially at this level. I\u2019m confident that himself, Mr. President, our party leaders and elders of our party will come up with a selection that is going to sell the party and the candidature of our party and ensure that victory, whether Muslim Muslim ticket ot Christian; whether from Northeast or wherever, I am confident that the party can come up with someone who will assist in the already victory that we are envisaging ahead of us. So whether it Muslim or Christian, we\u2019re all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long that I have been advocating that we should de-emphasize our fault lines; that which divides us; let us rather dwell on what unites us more. So that is my position.\n\n\u201cWell merits and balance, equity, fairness and justice. When you put all of them together as a political party, what comes to mind first is how do we win this election? If we don\u2019t win this election where do you now come about your fairness, equity and justice for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, merit is very key; I\u2019ve always been an advocate for merit because certain challenges that are confronting us today in this country, we need those who will come and solve this problem. If this place is not secured, we won\u2019t be here today. Those that are here today, securing the Villa, securing this press room are not selected based on religion.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not selected based on region, they are selected based on competence, capacity to be able to protect this villa. So we need those who will be able to solve all of these challenges that are confronting us today in Nigeria\u201d.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nSome members of the House of Representatives, yesterday, charged the parliament to override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the amendment the Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act.\n\nThis was sequel to a point of order raised by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member from Delta State, Ben Igbakpa, calling the attention of the House to the failure of the president to assent to amendment over 30 days after it was transmitted to him.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe House had on May 11 altered Section 84( 8) of the Electoral Act to make provision for statutory delegates in political parties primaries to nominate candidates for the 2023 polls. However, the president did not sign the amendment, and is yet to communicate to the House on the bill.\n\nThe current version, which was assented to by the president in February, prevented statutory delegates from taking part in party primaries.\n\nThe House while on recess convened an emergency session to amend Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nLawmakers, governors, Ministers, the president among others could not participate during the just concluded party primaries as statutory delegates were not allowed. This was not unconnected with the president\u2019s refusal to sign the amended 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nOn Monday, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila blamed the ad-hoc delegates system used for the conduct of political parties primaries for the loss of many members at the primaries.\n\nHowever, Igbakpa, while addressing the House, said since the president has failed to assent to the bill within the 30 days window provided by the constitution, the appropriate thing is for the parliament to override him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere it is said that one arm of government is subservient to the other\u2026And that is why we cannot continue to act as if we are under the executive arm of government. This Constitution gave us the powers just as it gave to them.\n\n\u201cWe must wake up as a parliamentarians. Where we pass our law and we are sure we have done the right thing we should start overriding Mr. President because this is just the beginning. Today NDDC Act is enforced because the parliament which you are part of did it. What are we afraid of?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, implored the House to activate the relevant constitutional provision and over ride the president.\n\nThe speaker, in his ruling, charged the lawmakers to come up with a motion on the override today. He noted that the parliament needs two-third majority to override the President on any bill.\n\n\u201cClearly the Constitution says it is 30 days leeway and we have gone beyond the 30 days. But the Constitution also says that it is not automatic that you override. If you are not convinced with the argument advanced by the president or in some cases and in this case, there is no arguments advanced, then you can override. But for us to override, I believe the required two-thirds and it cannot be by voice votes neither can it be by way of signatures unless of course you gave enough signatures by two-thirds.\u201d\n\nIn another motion by Benjamin Kalu, the House urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), to extend the voter registration by 60 days.\n\nThe Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise is scheduled to end on June 30.\n\nThe House urged INEC to extend the voters registration deadline by an extra 60 days to enable as many Nigerians as possible to register.\n\nKalu said the decision to suspend the voters\u2019 registration was in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, which required INEC to suspend voters\u2019 registration at least 60 days before an election.\n\nHe said in April, INEC declared that about 42 per cent of the voter registrations recorded since the commencement of CVR on 28 June, 2021, were invalid with about 20 million unclaimed Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs)\n\nKalu also said the large number of unregistered eligible voters willing to be registered as evidenced by crowd seen at various registration centres had resulted in congestion.\n\nHe expressed concern due to reports of shortages of voter registration machines, inadequate manpower and personnel at registration centres.\n\nAccording to him, this may lead to frustration among prospective registrants, and in some cases, unrest at some registration centres.\n\nHe said the right to vote was critically important to the health and legitimacy of the country\u2019s democracy, as well as electoral integrity.\n\nKalu stated that if nothing was done to improve the shortage of voter registration equipment, and extend the deadline for voters registration, millions of Nigerians would be disenfranchised, which would jeopardise the integrity of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe House, therefore mandated the Committee on Electoral Matters to engage INEC in order to examine and proffer solutions to the shortage of registration machines and manpower.\n\nHe added that INEC should also deploy an additional 30 voters registration machines in each local government area, train and deploy ad-hoc staff to improve the shortage of manpower at registration centres.\n\nHe added that security should also be provided for the ad hoc staff and report back within two weeks.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja\n\nChief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, yesterday, pledged to work towards the success of the All Progressive\u2019s Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former Abia State governor told newsmen in Abuja that he would make for Tinubu the same level of efforts he devoted to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, before and during the party\u2019s primary election.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe former governor of Lagos State emerged winner at the special presidential convention of the APC held at the Eagles Square in Abuja, beating 22 other presidential aspirants. Prior to Tinubu\u2019s emergence, Kalu led a sturdy campaign for Lawan to emerge as the party\u2019s flag bearer via consensus.\n\nKalu said he was satisfied that the party held the primary poll.\n\n\u201cI am very satisfied with the primary. Without that kind of primary, there could have been a lot of factions. Although my group was prepared for consensus, not a primary election, when it came suddenly, we had to abide by it . So, I\u2019m very happy that at the end APC won. We won and won resoundingly.\n\n\u201cThe next is to work for the APC and to work for the APC candidate. We have no alternative. I\u2019m a party man which most of you here can testify to. I\u2019m a very strong party man and I don\u2019t shy away from issues. Now, the way I fought for Lawan is the same way I\u2019ll fight for Bola Ahmed Tinubu,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile applauding President Muhammadu Buhari for not endorsing any presidential candidate, the former governor expressed optimism that South East would vote APC in 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always take my stand on any issue, whether I agree or disagree. I\u2019ve accepted that Bola Tinubu won and the whole party agreed there\u2019s no doubt about his victory and when there\u2019s no doubt about his victory, we just have to go to the field to work for our party\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cI pray that my constituency in the South-East will give us the same belief that they gave to President Buhari in 2019 which gave him 68 per cent of votes. I hope they\u2019ll be able to give APC the same number of votes.\n\n\u201cI told people that President Buhari would not take sides and that was what happened. He asked everybody to go to the field to try their luck and the message is that it is good for the Nigerian President and the Nigerian leaders not to take sides. It\u2019s good for our democracy and it also goes to the governors to stop taking sides,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "title": "After Members\u2019 Poor Performance in Primaries, Lawmakers Set to Override Buhari\u2019s Veto on Statutory Delegates",
          "text": "\u2022Deputy minority leader says electoral act has been weaponised\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives has resolved to move a motion to override President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to assent to the Clause 58(8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for Statutory Delegates.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila had at the resumption of plenary, Tuesday attributed the failure of many lawmakers in the 9th National Assembly to secure return ticket ahead of 2023 general election to the delegate system of candidates selection at the just concluded party primaries.\n\nAt the plenary, Wednesday, Hon. Ben Igbakpa representing Ethiope federal constituency of Delta State raised a constitutional point of order, citing section 58 (8) of the 1999 constitution which empowered the national assembly to enact laws and also override the President with two third majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nIgbakpa who was among the lawmakers that lost out in the just concluded primaries noted that there\u2019s no need for the House to fear anyone.\n\nHe therefore urged his colleagues to rise up, take the pen, collect signatures and override Mr. President and give Nigerians the enabling electoral law.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou have shown leadership and capacity and patriotism. On the 11th of May with your colleagues you brought all of us back from our various constituency so that we can work on the electoral act as amended. Graciously that was done on the 11th of May. And by 12th, this amendment was transmitted to Mr. President. Mr. President did not just ignore, he traveled out of the country on a condolence visit to Dubai and that created a lot of problem for the country. There was tension and many of our political parties out of the tension created that will now be for us in the 2023-2027 electoral process. Nigerians are crying for good leadership and the leadership recruitment process starts with our primaries.\n\n\u201cYou have worked hard and that is why I took us to Section 58. We are to make laws and present to Mr President, and where he does not sign, that same 58 gives us the powers to make sure that we pass that law without Mr. President\u2019s assent. There\u2019s no where that is said that one arm of Government is subservient to the other. I think we are beginning with the good work you are doing Mr. Speaker. I just said you are a very good man, a wonderful man with your leadership but by the time you leave this seat by June next year Mr. Speaker Nigerians will not remember the good thing that you have done for me as a person, for the one you have done for our colleagues, they will remember you for the laws that you passed that has bettered the lot of Nigerians.\n\nHe further said, \u201cAnd that is why we cannot continue to act as if we are under the executive arm of Government. This Constitution gave us the powers just as it gave to them. We must wake up as a Parliament where we pass our law and we are sure we have done the right thing we should start overriding Mr. President because this is just the beginning. Today NDDC Act is enforced because the parliament which you are part of did it. What are we afraid of? Mr. President has not committed an offence, what he has done is the rule of law and the Constitution and I believe by the time we do our own by override veto we would not have committed any offence, we will be working according to the constitution and the rule of law. I think it is time for us\u2026.. if we manage to come back that this parliament must stamp their feet and tell Nigerians that we are working for them and not for party or any individual.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Deputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, had said that the electoral act had been weaponized, calling for activation of relevant Constitutional powers to address the lacuna.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to take notice regarding the very copious and auspicious comments you made yesterday regarding the Electoral Act where in circumstances, it has been weaponised; where as a matter of fact, there was an aspiration to make the law a more perfect law to remove every ambiguity; and where there isn\u2019t any material difference between the 2010 Act and that of 2022. And suddenly, majority of members, where it has been weaponised, have become victims. Something is wrong in an environment, in an institution where the two leaders of the Senate would have to cross to other parties because of inherent inclement condition.\n\n\u201cAnything that occasions it, anything that warrants it, if it is our Electoral Act, if is our politics, if it is the environment where we operate, we need to retool. And like you said, we got to do a better work and we have to fight on. For me, it is just a battle that is lost, the war is on and we should go ahead to make sure that law is retooled, made clear. And if it requires this parliament to take action to override what has not been signed, we should be willing to do so.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, the Speaker Gbajabiamila who affirmed that Mr. President was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged the Hon. Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\n\u201cThank you for your point of order basically some of what you said is that there is a need in your own opinion for the house to override the withholding of assent to the electoral act (amendment). Clearly the Constitution says it is 30 days leeway and we have gone beyond the 30 days. But the Constitution also says that it is not automatic that you override, but if you are convinced as a House that that amendment must stand.\n\n\u201cIf you are not convinced with the argument advanced by the President or in some cases and in this case, there is no arguments advanced, then you can override. But for us to override I believe the required two-thirds and it cannot be by voice votes neither can it be by way of signatures unless of course you gave enough signatures by two-thirds. So what I will suggest is that you bring the application, the formal motion notice, perhaps tomorrow, whenever you are able to do that and we will determine whether or not this House is ready to override or not, I think that\u2019s the proper procedure,\u201d Gbajabiamila said\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker announced that the House will embark on annual two months recess in July, 2022.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says president refused to act as autocrat at APC convention\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, dismissed insinuations about President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision-making process, saying the president is in charge, and has been responsible for all decisions taken by his administration in the last seven years without interference from any third party or cabal. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, stated this yesterday in a release.\n\nShehu made reference to the recent presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that Buhari refused to act as a dictator; instead, he ensured a level playing field for all participants.\n\nHe emphasised that contrary to swirling misgivings in some quarters, the president had never relied on the opinions of third party elements, but had always taken his decisions without the backup of the so-called cabals or back-up boys.\n\nThe presidential aide said those still assailing the APC and the president, expounding conspiracy theories, and making all manner of speculations needed to understand those important points about the country\u2019s leader.\n\nShehu said the strong leader myth had lasted for far too long in the country, with people assuming that a leader must dominate everything, and even determine electoral outcomes.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cLuckily, for Nigeria, President Buhari does not suffer from such constraints. He refuses to act as the elected autocrat. The president had a clear purpose leading up to the primary: to ensure a transparent, free and fair process that will bring back people\u2019s faith in democracy by taking good governance up to the grassroots level.\n\n\u201cBy this alone, people\u2019s faith and that of the international community in our democracy has received a major boost since the completion of the APC nomination. The flag-bearer has been chosen. He has the president\u2019s unwavering support. The journey to victory continues.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman, however, clarified that the speculations in the media about the president\u2019s favourite candidate ahead of the APC primary were expected, especially, in a situation where the opportunity to choose a presidential candidate came once in eight years.\n\nAccording to him, the successful conduct of the convention and the eventual emergence of the party\u2019s standard-bearer must have been a disappointment for those who assembled to witness a catastrophe.\n\nShehu stated, \u201cNo intrigue, no division, no disagreement, no defeated candidates rejecting the result, no splits, no third-party runs. Only determination to rally around the chosen flag-bearer to deliver victory and an APC third term in February 2023. The opposition reaction to this successful nomination convention has come by way of a counter offensive, so that we do not go on the offensive.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that there was clear evidence of a conspiracy to destabilise the governing party and defame the president, as the media were inundated with made up stories and speculating about the role of the president in the contest: whether he had a favoured candidate, and whether manoeuvres were made to install him; whether the chosen flag-bearer was the president\u2019s choice, or another.\n\nThe presidential aide further stated, \u201cSpeculation is easy. But facts are simple. The president always said he had a favoured candidate. He said that candidate was whoever was chosen by the APC in a democratic primary to lead the party at the election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Lopsided Promotion Of Officers By Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Narcotics Agency, NDLEA Favours Candidates Of Political Office Holders, Denies Others For About 20 Years",
          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its harmonisation exercise, has allegedly denied some officers promotion for about 20 years, while some of their colleagues recruited much later after have been promoted up to two times.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the affected officers include CNA conversion course 1/2008 which comprised NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98, who were already on CNA rank earlier before January 2004; with effective dates of promotion to ASNII dating back to 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 for NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98 respectively.\n\nHowever, sources in the agency told SaharaReporters that while the affected officers\u2019 promotions have been stagnated for more than 15 years, those employed in \u201c2011, mostly candidates of political office holders, enjoyed double promotions ahead and above their older colleagues whom they met on the job and were stagnated on level 7 and below\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that their promotions have been cumulatively stagnated for about 10 to 20 years which translates to a loss of three to six ranks.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that they were promoted by one rank in the 2021 harmonisation exercise, one of the sources, however, pointed out that the promotion still kept them below their juniors who have received multiple promotions backdated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most recent NA course who were recruited as SNAs 13 to 17 years after our recruitment, and 4 to 7 years after our ideal ASN II effective dates, were promoted ahead of us going by their effective dates,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the stagnation of their careers and distortion of their seniority in the service predates 2014, adding that \u201cby 2014, some of us were already stagnated for up to 10 years\u201d.\n\n\n\nExplaining the process of conversion and how their promotion has been lopsidedly stagnated, another source said, \u201cThe criteria for successful conversion to the superintendent cadre is that the officer should have additional qualifications and attend mandatory conversion course.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the requirement of additional qualifications was waived for conversion courses 1 and 2 in favour of years of service and attainment of 50% cut-off mark as against 40% in normal promotion examinations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have served and kept fate with the agency in deprivation, and denied most of our benefits for 23 to 27 years, giving our youths, bearing the scars, dangers of the lowest level of servitude while aligning our aspirations to the vision of the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further explained that against its standard of conducting promotion examinations yearly, NDLEA did not conduct the examinations in 2006 and 2007, thereby denying CNAs who had resit the opportunity of promotion to ASN II with 2005 and 2006 effective dates their due opportunity to be promoted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all CNAs with earlier or 2004 effective dates were made to go through conversion course 1/2008 with no cognizance of the fact that some older NA courses 7/94 and 8/96 were on re-sit. This, the source, said is in contradiction to the normal promotion condition that those on re-sit need only retake their papers to be promoted.\n\nThe imposition of the conversion course on these unprepared sets of officers made them unsuccessful in conversion course 1, it was learnt.\n\n\n\nAlso, though the NDLEA Scheme of Service provides that the conversion course should be yearly, one of the sources said it was not conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and \u201cthis also denied the unsuccessful candidates of conversion course 1, the opportunity of getting back on track with our career progression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe negative impact was heightened thus,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nBy 2014 when they were eventually promoted to ASN II by virtue of CNA conversion course 2013; their promotion which would have been with effective dates of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were still on CNA for 10, 9, 8, and 7 years after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is loss of up to three ranks, meaning that as at 2013/2014 promotions, we would have been on the ranks of CSN, SN and DSN respectively. Though the effective dates of promotion of successful candidates of CNA conversion course 1 were backdated appropriately, that of CNA course 2/2013 converted officers were not backdated,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\n\nHe lamented that the negligence has affected them both financially and psychologically, especially as many of them draw closer to their retirement age.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs our juniors are being promoted far ahead of us, we struggle daily with low self-esteem, ridicule, disgrace, indiscipline and shattered self-confidence. Going by our years of service and staring retirement in the face, the bleakness of our service life aspirations confronts us daily. The instances of career stagnation have excluded us from any serious service responsibility like mid-level command responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmongst other things, one of the sources on behalf of the affected officers appealed to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), to place them on their ideal ranks of CSN and ACN and DCN, as this will help them rectify the distorted seniority issues.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that their effective dates of promotions should reflect their ideal career progression save for the loss of seniority through re-sit, and in the event of challenges of federal character and vacancy in their placement, harmonization or promotion to ACN and above, the CSN effective date should reflect their ideal career progression.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, they want the date of their first appointment and subsequent years of service to be used to place them accordingly, while individual service records are sought and used to place them properly with the correct effective dates according to individual peculiarities.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that in line with the NDLEA conditions of service 2019, the issue of additional qualifications should not affect the career progression of converted officers in the area of pegging, considering the fact that it was waived in favour of higher cut-off marks.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What does Gozem and IFC partnership mean?",
          "text": "12 million.\n\nThat\u2019s the estimated number of motor vehicle drivers that Gozem, a Francophone Africa-focused super app, says operate in informal markets across West and Central Africa. But there\u2019s a problem: these drivers do not have access to traditional banks or micro-finance institutions to finance their vehicles. Instead, they rely on money lenders that charge ridiculous interest rates\u2014some are as high as 70% annually.\n\nGozem, which provides a suite of mobility, e-commerce, and financial services to drivers, retailers, and other consumers, announced on Friday that it has partnered with the International Financial Commission (IFC) to solve these headaches for drivers.\n\nIFC has dedicated a $10 million investment into Gozem\u2019s vehicle financing project. This investment will enable Gozem to provide access to affordable vehicle financing in Togo and Benin, its operating markets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis deal comes about 6 months after Gozem closed a $5 million funding and 14 months after it started its vehicle financing program. The company said it has already helped more than 2,000 drivers acquire vehicles with affordable financing. This new partnership will finance new vehicles for 6,000 more drivers.\n\n\u201cMotor vehincle drivers in West and Central Africa will need access to $3 billion dollars of credit facilities annually to finance their vehicles and we are excited that IFC is placing their trust in Gozem to be at the forefront of providing affordable financing solutions to these underserved communities,\u201d Gregory Costamagna, co-founder and co-CEO of Gozem, said in a statement.\n\nUnlike banks that require credit history, asset collateral, or guarantors before issuing loans, or third-party lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates that are only increasing, Gozem simply uses drivers\u2019 data already available on its platform. The company provides this service by leveraging what Costamagna called its \u201csophisticated\u201d KYC process, financial and behavioural data, like the number of trips completed using its app\u2014which can be accessed in a matter of minutes\u2014to calculate drivers\u2019 credit worthiness. This alleviates drivers from keeping track of their bank statements and records; simply by using the app to find riders and gigs, Gozem knows how much they earn and how long they are likely to take to make their payments.\n\nGozem said in a statement sent to TechCabal that for the next year, they will also work with the IFC to test electric bikes in motovehicle operating conditions and \u201cbuild a green battery-swapping station network in Togo and Benin to demonstrate electric bikes can save drivers money.\u201d\n\nGozem\u2019s Raphael Dana, Costamagna\u2019s counterpart as co-founder and co-CEO told TechCabal over the phone that IFC is starting a pilot investment to test the impact and scalability of this model and will double down based on the result of the pilot.\n\nHe added that this partnership also factors in electric vehicles (EV). \u201cWe have set aside 10% of the investment for our EV pilot phase. There\u2019s a dedicated team working on our EV ambition and we need to ensure that the bikes, battery swapping, economic units, etc. work at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, the project will \u201cvalidate electric bikes and that their adoption at scale will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but it will also help drivers save money through lower energy and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have the power to said Aliou Maiga, IFC\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, emphasised that EVs have the potential to \u201ctransform the moto-taxi market in West and Central Africa by lowering carbon emissions and lowering operating costs for drivers.\u201d She said that by partnering with Gozem, together they could \u201cincrease affordable and green financing solutions for moto-taxi drivers to shift to electric bikes.\n\n\u201cWe hope IFC\u2019s investment for these underserved communities will encourage other investors and accelerate the reduction of poverty and greenhouse gasses emissions in these markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant uptick in access financing initiatives lately. Last year, Asaak went into a partnership with Untapped Global to finance 2,000 bikes in Uganda\u2014both EV and fossil-fuel vehicles. Untapped Global had also entered a similar partnership with South African Flexclub.\n\nLooks like Gozem is gearing up for some big funding. In March, Dana told Africa Report that the company was seeking an $80m Series B\u2014$50 million in equity, $20m in debt, and a $10 million pre-series B\u2014fundraising as it prepares to expand to new markets like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Senegal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "NITDA's Code of Practice to help Nigeria regulate social media",
          "text": "Months after it lifted its 7-month ban on Twitter, the Nigerian government has set out to regulate social media platforms with a new Code of Practice. Plans for the Code of Practice were announced in January by Director-General of NITDA, Mr Kashifu Inuwa.\n\nYesterday, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) announced that it had developed a draft Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries\u2014defined by the code as \u201celectronic medium or site where services are provided by means of a computer resource and on-demand and where users create, upload, share, disseminate, modify, or access information, including websites that provide reviews, gaming Platform, online sites for conducting commercial transactions.\u201d\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n13th June 2022\n\n\n\nNational Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Issues a Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries and Conditions for Operating in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/N9y3qfyCIu \u2014 NITDA Nigeria (@NITDANigeria) June 13, 2022\n\nAccording to NITDA, the draft was developed in collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC), with input from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and TikTok.\n\nIn the statement signed by NITDA Head of Corporate Affairs and External Relationships, Hadiza Umar, the Code is supposedly aimed at \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country, as well as defining guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem\u201d.\n\nWhat the Code instructs\n\nNITDA instructs that all Interactive Computer Service Platforms with more than 100,000 users would be required to fulfil certain conditions in order to operate in the country. While this includes US-based social media platforms, it also includes indigenous sites like Nairaland, blogs like Linda Ikeji, and newsletter platforms like Substack with over 100,000 users.\n\nThese platforms would have to register as legal entities with the country\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), pay taxes, appoint country representatives, and more notably, \u201cprovide information to the Nigerian government on harmful accounts, troll groups, and deleting all information that violates Nigerian law\u201d.\n\nThe draft Code is divided into 5 parts with the first 2 parts laying down the responsibilities of the Interactive Computer Service Platforms, while Part IV\u2014titled \u201cProhibitions\u201d\u2014lays down orders for the removal of material prohibited by Nigerian law. According to the draft, \u201cProhibited Material\u201d includes anything that threatens public interest, order, security, peace and morality\u2014content which must be taken down within 24 hours.\n\nIn Part I of the draft Code, NITDA lays down 11 primary responsibilities which include abiding by Nigerian laws, providing dedicated channels for government agencies to lodge complaints, removing any content reported by government agencies within 24 hours, disclosing identities of reported creators to the Nigerian government, and expeditiously removing non-consensual sexual content.\n\nPart II of the draft Code consigns 12 additional responsibilities including the requirement for Interactive Computer Service Platforms to file annual compliance reports that detail the numbers of [active] registered Nigerian users, deactivated accounts, and removed content, among other things. This part lists the responsibilities of the platforms to inform the users of their obligations which include abiding by all Nigerian laws.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poor regulatory history\n\nThere are few provisions within the draft Code that fulfills NITDA\u2019s aim of \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians\u201d. For example, Items 4 and 5 of Part I seek to protect Nigerians from promoting revenge porn and child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), while Item 1 of Part II promotes equal distribution of information for Nigerian users.\n\nAccording to \u2018Tooni Ajiboye, a lawyer and writer, \u201cThe good part of the bill is that it tries to hold these social media platforms accountable for all the information and mechanisms promoted on their platform. There are, however, red flags in the draft Code and they unfortunately outweigh the good.\u201d\n\nAs Ajiboye explains it, the biggest red flag in the draft Code is how much information it wants to control. \u201cThere are about 5 classes of information highlighted: misinformation, disinformation, harmful content, unlawful content, and prohibited materials. While unlawful content already has legal backing, misinformation and harmful content are left to discretion. It\u2019s easy to point out where child sexual abuse materials are criminalised in Nigerian law but the same can\u2019t be said for what the draft defines as prohibited or harmful material.\u201d\n\nPart IV of the code, which examines Prohibited Material, prescribes that all content that is contrary to morality, or public interest should be deleted once a complaint is made. This brings to light the possibility of the Nigerian government going after citizens who post materials in support of LGBTQ persons, or anyone posting content deemed religiously \u201cblasphemous\u201d, a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment in many Nigerian states.\n\nPart IV of NITDA\u2019s draft Code of Practice\n\nWhile these provisions wouldn\u2019t constitute a problem in other regions, Nigeria\u2019s history is riddled with fundamental human rights infringement and the misappropriation of laws. In the events following its #EndSARS protests where Nigerian youths fighting against police brutality were thrust into the global spotlight, many faced imprisonment and financial sanctions due to their involvement on and off social media.\n\nThe #EndSARS event, which also sparked commentary from celebrities like Rihanna, Trevor Noah, and ex-US president Barack Obama, spurred numerous attempts by the Nigerian government to regulate social media. There was the social media bill of 2019, and the hate speech bill which proscribed death as the penalty for hate speech. In 2021, there was also an attempt to modify the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to cover social media platforms.\n\nNigerians are against the bill\n\nSince the bill was announced yesterday, many Nigerians have taken to social media, specifically Twitter, to express their concerns over the bill.\n\nLawyer and satirist Elnathan John said, \u201cThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media.\u201d\n\nThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media. https://t.co/JPhGnQp5GT \u2014 Elnathan John (@elnathan_john) June 14, 2022\n\nAjiboye noted that the Code is still in its draft stage so there\u2019s the possibility that most of its provisions would be revised. \u201cSpeaking objectively, they\u2019re releasing the draft so they can get feedback from stakeholders and ensure that whatever is enacted is palatable to the people the Code will apply to.\u201d\n\nThe draft Code is yet to be enacted but many Nigerians have been encouraged by Digital Africa Research Labs, an NGO studying social media misuse on the continent, to send their comments to NITDA at info@nitda.gov.ng. TechCabal has reached out to Digital Africa Research Labs for more comments but is yet to receive responses at the time of publication.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Federal University of Education (Technical) Bichi establishment Bill 2022 has passed second reading on the floor of the Senate.\n\nThe Bill was read the first time in this Hallowed Chamber on Thursday, 8th October, 2020 and was sponsored by Sen. Barau, I. Jibrin (Kano North).\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, for any country to achieve meaningful development, the socio economic and political system must be enhanced. This is why successive Nigerian governments placed much emphases on the development of the individual as a means to national development. Education is the sure means of developing individual potentials.\n\nSenator Barau pointed out that the National Policy on Education (1981) postulates that education is \u201cthe greatest investment that the nation can make for the quick development of its economic, political, sociological and human resources.\u201d Among the various educational institutions through which the nation hopes to achieve its developmental goals, specialized Universities of Education should take pre-eminence because they are set up to train the trainers.\n\n\u201cThe development of a sound and robust educational system in any country is therefore predicated on the availability of qualified and well trained teachers to impact the required knowledge on the students.\u201d\n\n\u201d Thus, the need to have a strong system in our educational sector that shall continuously produce well qualified and trained teachers as is obtainable in other countries cannot be overemphasized. This is the fundamental justification for the establishment of this specialized institution of higher learning: the Federal University of Education (Technical) Bichi.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the realization that Universities of Education are tools for national development have led to an unbridled quest for and vigorous expansion of such institutions in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe outlined the objectives of the University in the Bill among others to include:\n\nThe encouragement of the advancement of learning to all persons without distinction of race, creed, sex or political conviction.\n\nThe develop and offer academic, technical and professional programmes leading to the award of certificates, first degrees, post graduate research, diploma and higher degrees with emphasis on planning, developmental and adaptive skills in Education. Engineering, Technology, Applied science. Agriculture, Commerce, Arts, Social science, Humanities, Management and Allied professional disciplines.\n\nTo produce socially mature educational men and women with capabilities not to only understand the educational and technological needs of Nigeria as a nation, but also to exploit existing Educational infrastructure and improve on them to develop new ones.\n\nTo act as agents and catalysts for effective Educational system, through post graduate training, research and innovation, for effective economic utilization and conservation of the country\u2019s human and material resources.\n\nTo bring quality change in Technical Education by focusing on teacher Education, through teaching and learning innovations.\n\nAlso, to collaborate with other national and international educational institutions involved in training, research and development of Education, with a view towards promoting governance, leadership and management skills among Educational managers and to provide and promote sound basic Education training as a foundation for the development of Nigeria, taking into account indigenous culture and the need to enhance national unity.\n\nThe lawmaker also in compliance with Order 76(3) of the Standing Rules of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with respect to the procedure of Bills, Compendium and Consolidation, gave the compilation of the summary of the anticipated recurrent and capital expenditure in the first twelve months following the commencement of this Act.\n\nFEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION (TECHNICAL) BICHI\n\nTOTAL:\n\nTOTAL ALLOCATION:\n\nPERSONNEL COST SALARY:\n\nSALARIES AND WAGES CONSOLIDATED SALARY\n\n1,126,529,588\n\n1,126,529 588\n\n237,640.699\n\n655,60,621\n\n655.680.621\n\n655,680,621\n\n81.960,078\n\n81,960,078\n\nALLOWANCES AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION: ALLOWANCES\n\nNON REGULAR ALLOWANCES:\n\nFOREIGN SERVICE ALLOWANCE\n\n32,784,031\n\n49.176.047\n\n277.3727.778\n\nTOTAL GOODS AND NON-PERSONAL SERVICES GENERAL OVERHEAD COST\n\nTRAVELE TRANSPORT GENERAL\n\nLOCAL TRAVEL & TRANSPORT: TRAINING:\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCONSTRUCTION/PROVISION\n\nCONSTRUCTION/PROVISION OF FIXED ASSETS-GENERAL CONSTRUCTION/ PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE:\n\n277.777.378\n\n717,540,699\n\nTOTAL PERSONNEL\n\nTOTAL OVERHEAD TOTAL RECURRENT\n\nTOTAL CAPITAL\n\nTOTAL ALLOCATION:\n\n848 751.810\n\n277,777,278\n\n1, 126, 529,588\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The state defeated 22 other beneficiary states to clinch the national award.\n\nEdo State also came out tops in two other categories, including Best in Disbursement/Engineering/Civil Works/Bio-Engineering and Best in Counterpart Funding. These are in addition to coming as runner-up in several other categories. The honour is the highest winning by any state out of the 23 NEWMAP participating states.\n\nThe Edo NEWMAP Project Coordinator, while briefing journalists, on Wednesday, said the honour is on the back of the support of the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who has spared no resources in positively impacting the lives of residents, in line with his government\u2019s vision of making Edo great again.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe efforts and commitment of the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki at implementing infrastructural renewal and sustainable development initiatives in Edo earned NEWMAP in the state the rain of awards at the just-concluded closing/valedictory session for the NEWMAP project in Abuja.\n\n\u201cEdo State came out tops in three (3) categories, which is the highest winning by any state out of the 23 NEWMAP participating states. The categories are best overall performing state; best in Disbursement/Engineering/Civil Works/Bio-Engineering, and best in Counterpart Funding. These are in addition to coming as runner up in several other categories.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cIt is on record that Edo State NEWMAP accounted for about 17 percent of the overall success of NEWMAP in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEdo NEWMAP paid over N3.2bn as counterpart fund, which is over twice more than the nearest contributing state and over 17 percent of the total counterpart paid under NEWMAP.\u201d\n\nThe project coordinator added, \u201cThe Edo-NEWMAP under the leadership of Governor Obaseki built a total length of over 40kms of secondary drains. This is in addition to the over 14kms of primary stormwater culverts, drains, and over 4km of earth stormwater channels, among other projects to check flood and improve the livelihoods of Edo people.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obaseki is serious about frontally tackling the environmental challenges of the state and his commitment to ensuring durable infrastructure to prevent further erosion and destruction of public and private infrastructure and potential agricultural land earned Edo NEWMAP the accolades which it recently received from the World Bank.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Chairman, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Mr Sanusi Garba, has assured that Nigerians will witness improved power supply from July 1 following renewed efforts by industry stakeholders.\n\nGarba gave the assurance at an interactive session with newsmen after the Second Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) meeting on Wednesday in Lagos.\n\nThe meeting was attended by top officials of NERC, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Generation Companies as well electricity Distribution Companies.\n\nHe said NERC had facilitated a contractual agreement between the Gencos, TCN and the 11 DisCos that would guarantee the generation, transmission and distribution of an average of 5,000MW of electricity daily to customers effective July 1.\n\nAccording to him, the contract is binding on all the players across the sector\u2019s value chain and stipulates penalties for any party that defaults on the arrangement under the new regime.\n\n\u201cYes, we have had discussions with the gas suppliers within our regulatory space. We have them on board to ensure that once we made the commercial requirements, gas was going to flow.\n\n\u201cNow, for transmission, we have heard of figures well in excess of 5,000MW and clearly TCN will be able to deliver that.\n\n\u201cI recall clearly in March last year we had 5,400MW. So, it means it is quite possible based on signed commitments.\u201d\n\nHe said all the stakeholders across the value chain had obligations and there would be consequences if they failed to deliver.\n\n\u201cSo, in a situation where Gencos are able to deliver 5,000MW but TCN is unable to do so, they\u2019ll pay the penalty to the generation company and so on.\n\n\u201cAnd whenever the power is available and DisCos do not take the power; then they will pay liquidated damages that will compensate other market participants.\n\n\u201cWe might not have 24/7 power supply from July 1 but Nigerians will see the trajectory because the target is to have an average of 5,000MW daily for transmission and distribution,\u201d said Garba.\n\nHe also blamed the recent collapse of the national grid on inadequate gas supply, maintenance of some thermal stations as well as vandalism of power infrastructure and gas pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe challenges of today are very clear. In the past, it used to be weak infrastructure and so on and so forth. Now we have certain external factors contributing to these events.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s not common around the world to see people coming down, pulling down transmission towers for no reason; or blowing up crude oil lines.\n\n\u201cIn a number of instances, most of the gas we have today is associated gas and because of that when crude lines are disrupted it also affects the supply of gas to the thermal stations,\u201d he said.\n\nGarba commended the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the interventions in the power sector, adding that country would soon start feeling the impact of the investments positively.",
          "summary": "The Chairman, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Mr Sanusi Garba, has assured that Nigerians will witness improved power supply from July 1 following renewed efforts by industry stakeholders.\nGarba gave the assurance at an interactive session with newsmen after the Second Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) meeting on Wednesday in Lagos.\nThe meeting was attended by top officials of NERC, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Generation Companies as well electricity Distribution Companies.\n\u201cWe might not have 24/7 power supply from July 1 but Nigerians will see the trajectory because the target is to have an average of 5,000MW daily for transmission and distribution,\u201d said Garba.\nHe also blamed the recent collapse of the national grid on inadequate gas supply, maintenance of some thermal stations as well as vandalism of power infrastructure and gas pipelines.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAs the July 16th Osun governorship election draws nearer, the erstwhile commissioner for Local government and chieftaincy affairs under Rauf Aregbesola administration, Barr. Kolapo Alimi, on Wednesday, defected to People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, saying governor Adegboyega Oyetola has divided the ruling APC.\n\nAlimi who is currently one of the legislative aide to Speaker of House of Representatives, Rt. Hon Femi Gbajabiamila said APC under Oyetola has been sharply divided due to his self- centred policy.\n\nThe official defection that took place at the state party secretariat, Biket Junction, along Osogbo/ Ikirun road on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking, Alimi who defected alongside with his supporters said, \u201cToday I and my loyalists have moved to PDP and we plead with the people of Osun State that come July 16, they should come out enmasse to vote for senator Ademola Adeleke as the governor of the state.\n\n\u201cAny political oberserver in the state that has been monitoring political development in the state will know that shortly after his inauguration, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola started divisive politics against those he perceived as loyalists of Aregbesola.\n\n\u201cWe have cried out to so many quarters without any solution. You know Aregbesola himself is a bigwig in APC, he cannot leave the party but to those of us that can no longer withstand the heat that Oyetola is using against us, we have to move out.\n\n\u201cWe know that by the grace of God oyetola will lose, there is no amount of power intimidation or threat that can save him. He has come, he has divided the party. Those that actually worked for him he alienated them. He doesn\u2019t know the value of his office that is why he cannot protect it\u201d\n\n\u201cAregbesola is a member of APC, he cannot be in support my move but for those of us that were alienated because of our loyalty to Aregbesola and any political watcher will know that Oyetola will continue to malign Aregbesola. You cannot get any benefit from Oyetola no matter your contribution and we cannot do that so we move out.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the governoship candidate of PDP, Senator Adeleke said he was so excited to receive one of the bigwigs in APC to the PDP fold, saying that it shows how APC would be rejected by the people of the state come July 16th election.\n\nHe said the chances of PDP winning the said election is growing, day by day. \u201clet me just say 80%\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was concerned about the election being rigged again, Adeleke said, \u201cWell I thank the President of the federal republic of Nigeria, President Buhari who signed the electoral law, the electoral law that he signed, he has already decreased the rigging so I believe that a lot of people of Osun State they are more wise, they are ready to defend their votes so I don\u2019t believe it going to be possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not by force to rule, people have to decide who they want and I believe it is me, Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) on Wednesday, said it may direct its members in the South West to increase the pump prices of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), as well as the AGO, popularly called Diesel should the appropriate Federal Government\u2019s regulatory agency fails to address the continuous non -supply of the products to its members.\n\nIPMAN\u2019s South West Zonal Chairman, Alhaji Dele Tajudeen, who made the disclosure while addressing journalists in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said his members had for the past six months, not been able to access supplies of the products from any of the six government\u2019s owned depots, but resorted to making purchase from the private depot owners, who had continued to exploit the situation to put extra cost on his members.\n\nTajudeen explained that the Federal Government\u2019s depots at Mosimi in Sagamu, Ogun State, Ibadan, Lagos, Ore in Ondo State as well as the one in Ilorin, Kwara State capital had all refused to load any of the independent marketers.\n\nThe development, he said compelled his members to start making purchases from the private depot owners since January, 2022.\n\nThe IPMAN Zonal Chairman further disclosed that these private depot owners had however, decided to take advantage of the non-availability of the products at government\u2019s depots to jack up the loading price to between N157 and N158, \u201cexcluding the transportation cost to our various destinations\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time we add the cost of transportation to the purchasing amount, we will be arriving at a sum above N165, which is the government approved pump dispensing price\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut sad enough, the regulatory agency appeared incapacitated to control and compel these private depot owners to sell at government\u2019s approved price for us\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs at today, the purchasing price of diesel has increased by 400%. Again, I want members of the general public to know that cost of transporting the product ranges between N6 to N8 and N10 depending on where the products are being transported to from the Lagos private depot where we make purchases\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wish to equally intimate you that making purchases from these private depot owners is not the ultimate end, we also have some overhead costs to bear like running an electricity generator to power our filling stations; paying the staff salaries, as well as servicing the bank loans among other costs.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time we have to add the cost of transportation with the purchasing amount, this situation clearly implied that we as independent marketers will be left with no other option than to dispense the products for nothing lesser than N175 to N180 for customers in the Lagos to Ibadan axis, while those within the Ogbomoso and Ilorin axis may have to buy at a dispensing pump price of N200 per litre.\n\n\u201cNow, we want to let members of the general public to be aware that the fault is not coming from our end, rather, it is the failure of the regulatory agency to direct the government\u2019s depots to sell the products for us at their depots and at the government\u2019s approved price\u201d, he stated.",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Mr Dumebi Kachikwu, has called on Nigerians to join his mission to rescue the country from the rot in the polity.\n\nKachikwu, who expressed sadness at the spate of killings across the country, said the North West and North East are at war, the North Central is not spared, while there is insecurity and recurring killing in the South East. He further said the South West is under the same heat with the recent attack on a church in Owo, Ondo State.\n\n\u201cAs the president of Nigeria, you will have a country that works for everyone. We can\u2019t live and die with a Nigeria where nothing works. As history beckons on us, we must accept the call and work towards a great Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told senior journalists in Abuja yesterday that while these killings persist, nobody cares because they are happening far off from where the powers that be, are. He observed that the killings were also taking place because there was nothing that binds Nigerians together.\n\nKachikwu, who is the founder of Roots Television, defeated former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Kingsley Moghalu and Chukwuka Monye to pick the APC ticket. He got 977 votes to Moghalu\u2019s 589 and Monye\u2019s 339 votes.\n\nThe ADC presidential candidate said Nigerians will do the right thing in 2023 if they knew that first, they are the ones who will be on the ballot papers in the next election and not the so-called big parties and their candidates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said if the citizens have this mindset, they would not allow the wrong thing and wrong people to continue.\n\nAccording to him, in advanced democratic climes, the emergence of the candidates of the big parties would have been seen as an embarrassment, but lamented that \u201cit is not so in Nigeria. The media must therefore rise to change this negative narration.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI am running a rescue mission race. My ambition will be doomed without the support of the media. The citizens of this country and the media should join me in this rescue mission to take the country back to the right track. There is nothing that binds us together in the country and that is why we kill ourselves\n\n\u201cIf 10 percent of media practitioners believe in the rescue mission of the ADC, there will be a robust re-orientation and revolution in the polity. It is against this backdrop that I appeal to Nigerians and the media to give us the chance to run and win the race and Nigeria will be better for it. Tell the people that there is a change agent and a tiger in the presidential race, who can and will make things happen.\n\nWhile reviewing his victory at the ADC presidential primaries, Kachikwu said he went to the ADC to be a part of the democratic process, stressing that he could have joined parties where he would become the sole presidential candidate.\n\nKachikwu said he went to the party\u2019s primaries with a conviction to win and to go back to his business if he lost. \u201cFrom the early stages of the primaries and the mood, I took my laptop to prepare a letter conceding defeat and to support whoever won the ticket. But, over time, the tide changed and the delegates were nodding and impressing upon me that I can will.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I dropped my laptop and joined the emerging euphoria. Before the primaries, I engaged the delegates and told them what I will do for Nigeria as the country\u2019s president. It was not money that I offered them. Sadly, the same people, who gave money and lost, resorted to defaming me and desecrating the process that produced me as the ADC standard bearer. I reached out to the losers so that we could move on but they ignored my gesture,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Reactions trail allegation Peter Obi\u2019s 3-day Egypt trip not to understudy power, education",
          "text": "Nigerians have reacted to a claim that the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi travelled to Egypt to attend the Annual General Meeting of Afreximbank which holds from Wednesday to Saturday.\n\nRecall that Obi announced his departure to the North African country to understudy the education, power and finance sectors as he plans to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari if he wins the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHis departure has been criticised at some quarters that he should not have left the country at this time, but a fresh condemnation arose when a tweep Jackson Ude @jacksonpbn claimed that the former Anambra Governor had only travelled for his personal purpose.\n\nUde alleged that Obi has lied to Nigerians in a series of tweet on Wednesday with a screenshot of the Afreximbank AGM details of the programme scheduled to hold between June 15 and 18, 2022.\n\nPeter Obi tweeted yesterday, \u201cI just departed for Egypt on a 3-day visit as part of my detailed study of comparable countries to Nigeria. In Egypt, I am expected to understudy, among others, the Egyptian Power Sector, Education, Planning and Finance Sectors. \u2013PO.\u201d\n\nCountering his tweet today, Jackson Ude @jacksonpbn tweeted, \u201cBUSTED: Peter Obi is attending the Annual General Meeting, AGM of Afreximbank in Cairo, Egypt and not to understudy Egypt\u2019s Education, Power and Finance Sector. The Afreximbank AGM is a gathering of the Bank\u2019s shareholders to appraise her performance. PO should not lie to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku or any of Presidential candidate tells you he is traveling to understudy the education, power and financial sector of the United States for three days and it turns out he is attending his company\u2019s shareholders annual meeting, you will call him a liar. HYPOCRITES!\n\n\u201cEvery Presidential candidate must be held by the same standards. Their words must match their actions. We must stop playing the ostrich when it comes to who we support. A shareholders meeting is different from understudying country\u2019s sectors.\u201d\n\nHowever, reactions from Twitter users appeared to be in support of Obi who is gaining political acceptance among Nigerian youths across the country.\n\nOne of the reactions from FS Yusuf @FS_Yusuf_ said: \u201cCome on, what sort of lame and no-brainer conclusion are you making here!? AFEXIMBANK has contributed immensely in several developmental project in Egypt\u2019s power sector, they\u2019ve also invested in SE region of Nigeria. @PeterObi trip to Egypt at this auspicious time when AFREXIM is holding its summit, isn\u2019t any shady action.\n\n\u201cHe noted in his tweet, he would be engaging in other activities. So if he is deciding to be at d sideline of the event to understudy strategy frameworks that could be replicated here, I don\u2019t see what you have busted abeg. Try rest.\u201d\n\nAnother reaction from Orji Williams Uguru @orjiguru tweeted: \u201cAccording to @PeterObi he clearly stated he\u2019s going to Egypt for the understudy, among other things of which what you just stated could be one of them. What exactly has been busted?\u201d\n\nAfreximbank, coined from its name African Export\u2013Import Bank is a pan-African multilateral trade finance institution created in 1993 under the auspices of the African Development Bank. It is headquartered in Cairo, Egypt. Afreximbank\u2019s vision is to be the trade finance bank for Africa.\n\nThe Bank, which was established in Abuja, Nigeria in October, 1993 by African Governments, African private and institutional investors has posted on its website that the AGM will be held in the New Administrative Capital of the Arab Republic of Egypt from 15 to 18 June 2022.\n\nThe theme of the AGM is \u201cRealising the AfCFTA Potential in the post COVID-19 Era\u2014Leveraging the power of the youth.\u201d",

          "text": "In a last-ditch effort to push for a Vice Presidential candidate from the South East, some supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party, have begun a subtle campaign to sway the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to pick a South easterner.\n\nNews Direct gathered in Abuja, on Wednesday, that the Sen. Iyiochia Ayu-led PDP National Working Committee, approved the recommendations of its panel saddled with the responsibility of assisting the party\u2019s candidate to choose a running mate.\n\nThe panel was gathered and recommended three persons: Governors Udom Emmanuel, Ifeanyi Okowa, and Wike, after which the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, was said to have garnered 13 out of 17 votes to emerge as the top contender for the job.\n\nIt is being alleged that in an attempt to stop Wike, some of his opponents are said to be behind trending videos of his previous media interviews in which he vowed never to accept the position of Vice President.\n\nOne of the party\u2019s chieftains from Kogi State, Musa A. Musa who is a proponent of a South Easterner getting the job, had in making a case for the zone, said, \u201cSince Atiku, a North Easterner is our candidate, it is only logical that the Vice Presidential position be micro-zoned to the South East.\u201d\n\nHe based his argument on the fact that the zone has not produced a president since Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 and that the zone has remained consistent in voting for the PDP.\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein in a previous interview, former Enugu State Governor and current Senator representing Enugu East in the Senate, Chimaroke Nnamani, said, \u201cHow can we (Ndigbo) be proud to belong to a union where we cannot aspire or be considered for top positions?\n\n\u201cIf 2023 passes without the South East being accommodated in the power arrangement, we would have to wait for the next 16 years and will be out of power reckoning for 40 years from 1999.\u201d\n\nHowever, a usually reliable source in Atiku\u2019s camp, who spoke in confidence because of the sensitivity of the issue said, \u201ccontrary to what is making the rounds in the media, the candidate is expecting three names to be forwarded to him to pick one from. Yes, he reached out to the party to make recommendations but the final decision is his to make.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, PDP NWC on Wednesday set up a panel to screen nominees for the Vice Presidential slot.\n\nThe screening panel which is scheduled to meet candidates on Thursday is headed by former foreign affairs minister, Chief Tom Ikimi while former Kogi governor Captain Idris Wada and former Aviation minister Ostia Chidoka are members.\n\nOthers are Binta Bello, Mutiat Adedoja, Austin Opara, Aisha Madawaki, George Ologun, Chidiebelu Mofus, Fidelis Tapgun, and Akilu Indabawa who will serve as secretary.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba.\n\nHe said the NWC set up the panel pursuant to part V1, paragraph 14 of the Electoral Guidelines of the Party.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nation\u2019s petroleum industry remains the major source of foreign exchange earnings to the Nigerian economy. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at efforts by the First Bank of Nigeria efforts to the nation\u2019s oil and gas sector financing.\n\nOver the years, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services provider, has remained a major player in infrastructure financing in the oil and gas sector. The petroleum sector which is the mainstay of the Nigerian economy has continued to play a vital role in shaping economic and political destiny of the country.\n\nThe discovery of crude oil in the country had impacted the economy both positively and negatively.\n\nAlthough the large proceeds are obtained from the domestic sales and export of petroleum products, its effect on the growth of the nation\u2019s economy in terms of return and productivity is still questionable.\n\nThe Nigerian economy is largely dependent on its oil sector for supplies of about 93 percent of its foreign exchange earnings.\n\nThe upstream oil industry is the Nigeria\u2019s lifeblood as it is the single most important sector in the country\u2019s economy, providing over 90 per cent of its total exports. The downstream oil industry in Nigeria is another key sector that contributes to the growth of the economy. The country has four oil refineries, eight oil companies and 750 independents all active in the marketing petroleum products.\n\nChallenges facing petroleum industry\n\nApart from contributing to the nation\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, there are other risks associated with investment in then Nigerian oil sector. These risks are grouped into three categories; political activity and civil unrest, border disputes and government underfunding. The problem of civil unrest has resulted in the shutting down of terminals and flow stations. The major challenge remains the equitable sharing of the country\u2019s multi-billion annual oil revenues among its population who, in some areas, rank amongst the poorest in the world and the environmental responsibilities of the oil multinationals. The issue of border disputes is common to Nigeria as it happens from time to time.\n\nThe situation in the sector is exacerbated by corruption within the industry and the government.\n\nSupport for the oil & gas financing\n\nDespite all the challenges in the sector, FirstBank has been at the forefront of assisting indigenous firms to take full advantage of the opportunities in the oil and gas industry in line with the Nigerian Local Content Act, by providing requisite financing.\n\nThe bank is widely acknowledged as the leading player in oil and gas financing and has a proven pedigree in providing both financial and advisory backing for players in the sector. Some of the bank\u2019s activities in the sector include Vessel finance facility, provisions of term loan , asset finance facility.\n\nOther financing activities in the sector include funding rig acquisition for indigenous operators, financing lines to indigenous fabricators for oil and gas contracts, funding specialised vessel acquisition scheme for local content support, and supporting major pipeline distribution and gas infrastructural development projects in several communities.\n\nUpstream\n\nIn the upstream oil and gas sector, First Bank\u2019s dedicated team is poised to help provide needed support investors require in navigating the ever-changing industry dynamics along the value chain. Apart from offering basic and bespoke services to meet individual or company specific business needs, the bank is working closely with the Treasury, Risk, Investment Banking and Asset Management Team to provide options in managing the business risk associated with the volatilities and vagaries in the sector\n\nAccording to the bank, its experienced relationship team is especially committed to helping business achieve better results. The sector remains a critical part for growth and development in Nigeria and many developing countries across Africa.\n\nOil is produced from five of Nigeria\u2019s seven sedimentary basins: the Niger Delta, Anambra, Benue Trough, Chad, and Benin.\n\nDownstream\n\nFirstBank developed different products offering in downstream oil and gas, specifically designed to support business needs of its customers. Some of the product offerings include: financial advisory, escrow management, working capital support, asset acquisition & project finance, structured trade and commodity finance, contingent liability management \u2013 bonds and guarantee, tax and duty payment, letters of credit and bills for collection, online payments and digital collections, liquidity and supply chain management, currency swaps and forwards, and liability management.\n\nThe oil and gas downstream sector remains strategic to the country and it is a key driver of the nation\u2019s economy. The sector has four refineries with a nameplate capacity of 445,000 bbl/d.\n\nProblem in downstream sector\n\nThe sector is faced with different problems such as fire outbreak, sabotage, poor management, lack of turn around maintenance and corruption. All these affected the oil production in the country and have forced the refineries to often operate at 40 per cent of full capacity, if at all. This has also resulted in shortages of refined product and the need to increase imports to meet domestic demand.\n\nNigeria has a robust petrochemicals industry based on its substantial refining capacity and natural gas resources, that focuses around the three centres of Kaduna, Warri and Eleme.\n\nWhy choose First Bank?\n\nThe bank is the leading financial institution for partnership in the downstream sector. It has key relationship with critical stakeholders and over 100 years cogent experience in Downstream Business Management Innovation solution and creative problem-solving\n\nOil and gas contract finance\n\nThe oil and gas contract finance is a product designed to meet the funding requirements of indigenous oil and gas companies who are either customers or prospects of FirstBank. The major target of the product is to ensure companies increase profitability.\n\nFeatures\n\nIt is self-liquidating as the facility is contingent upon receipt of contract proceeds after successful completion of milestone. The facility is short tenured and it is mostly between 90-360 days depending on the contract being executed.\n\nThe bank provides up to 70 per cent of cost of contract execution and not cost of contract value.\n\nThe product has essentially domiciliation of contract proceeds as the sole comfort except where facility is in excess of N50 million for Project Finance which must be secured with tangible collateral.\n\nFirst Bank\u2019s view on oil and gas financing\n\nMaking the bank\u2019s position known on financing the sector, Chief Executive Officer of FirstBank, Adesola Adeduntan, at an Energy Finance Forum, promised operators in the oil and gas sector that they will continue to receive financial support that their company needs of to grow efficiently in the industry, insisting that the company has products tailored to meet the financial needs of operators in the oil and gas sector, which will boost their profitability.\n\nAdeduntan, who was represented by the bank\u2019s Executive Director, Public Sector, Abdullahi Ibrahim at the forum sponsored by the bank at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), assured operators of profitable business partnership.\n\nDuring the session tagged, \u201cFinanciers and the petroleum industry: Gaining mutual understanding to grow\u201d, he said the bank had been supporting the oil and gas sector with funds through some of its products that provide finance for oil contracts.\n\nOn the First Bank oil and gas finance product Adeduntan said, accelerating development needs infrastructure finance, adding that attracting long-term investment to the oil and gas sector needs establishment of appropriate regulatory environment.\n\nAccording to him, First Bank\u2019s oil industry contract finance product was designed to meet the funding requirements of indigenous oil and gas companies who were either customers or prospects of the bank.\n\n\u201cThis has been beneficial to operators in the sector and it has increased their profitability and impacted greatly on their operations over the years,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that registered members who are existing or new customers of FBN have been receiving support from the lender, and the bank had been providing finance for stock of white petroleum products in the downstream oil sector.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Onu Okorie\n\nThe Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) need to collaborate to achieve exchange rate stability, ABCON President, Aminu Gwadabe has said.\n\nHe said the BDCs can also be used as tool in ending multiple rate practices, and ushering in stability in the forex market.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Operational Manual defines BDCs as small retail end institutions licensed to carry on the business of selling Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Business Travel Allowance (BTA), school fees and medical bills payment abroad among other roles at the critical retail end of the foreign exchange market.\n\nHowever, the various policies of the CBN on the operation of the sub-sector continues to be inhibitive and limiting BDCs\u2019 from providing their constitutional roles in the forex market and economy.\n\nGwadabe has therefore called for collaboration between the BDCs and the CBN in the implementation of market-friendly policies that will make the BDCs impact more positively in the market and promoting exchange rate stability in the economy.\n\nThe ABCON boss said the hasty generalisation that criminalizes the BDC sub-sector as responsible for all market crisis and infractions like selling dollars with higher premium above regulatory limit, promoting loss of confidence in the near, and multiplicity of the exchange rates is not in the best interest of the market and economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in view of this disturbing situation and the need to strengthen BDCs value chain as obtainable in organised climes that we urge the regulators and policymakers to consider BDCs as the most potent tool in liberalising the foreign exchange market and stopping multiples exchange rates in the system.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the BDCs have since 2006, provided policymakers with a window in achieving their mandate of exchange rate stability and price equilibrium. He therefore called for the reintegration of the BDCs into the forex market ecosystem to sustain their roles in the economy.\n\nGwadabe said the BDCs have for years remained effective and creative in contributing to the forex market.\n\nFor instance, the introduction of the Investors & Exports (I&E) FX window in 2017 was as a result of agitations from stakeholders like ABCON, foreign investors, Nigerians in Diaspora who advocated for it to allow more dollar inflows to the economy boost foreign reserves, and raise confidence in the naira by addressing widening rate premiums.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to address the challenges facing the forex market, now is the time to integrate BDCs into the market activities as agent of stabilization and delivering the market to the promised land\u201d.\n\nOn how ready the BDCs are for the responsibility, Gwadabe said the operators have for years been preparing for a time like this by integrating technology into their operations and promoting efficiency and transparency in their businesses.\n\nFor instance, ABCON trains Compliance Officers to ensure they are acquainted with what is required of them, especially on monthly rendition of results and tracking illicit capital flows to the market through compliance initiatives.\n\nAccording to him, the BDCs will continue to comply with the rendition of suspicious transactions reports as directed by NFIU, CBN, and EFCC through constant training their directors and sanctioning of erring operators.\n\n\u201cIn compliance with the provisions of Bank and Other Financial Institutions (BOFIA) as amended, every BDC renders returns to the CBN in prescribed format and within the deadline stipulated by the CBN. The records of the BDCs are made readily available to the CBN examiners as and when requested including carrying out customer due diligence, corporate governance and tax returns,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that ABCON has over the years established itself as a key player in the BDC industry, made several commitments and sacrifices to ensure that the sector continues to thrive against all odds.\n\nGwadabe said that BDCs have achieved major success with operational digitization as operators have been empowered to file their weekly, monthly or quarterly reports from anywhere without clustering at CBN\u2019s offices.\n\nHe said ABCON digitized BDCs operations with the official launch and take off of the ABCON Live Run Automation Portal in Lagos, which has the backing of the CBN.\n\nThe ABCON Live Run Automation Portal, he added, ended decades of manual filling of regulatory reports by BDCs and enhanced global competitiveness of operators.\n\nThe portal, which is a game changer in the Nigerian BDC Industry, is the final phase of automating all BDCs\u2019 operations and integrating them with the operations of CBN, NFIU and Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) for improved compliance with regulation and seamless operations in line with global best practices.\n\nGwadabe reiterated ABCON\u2019s commitment to boosting liquidity in the forex market, fulfilling its regulatory mandate of bringing forex closer to the end users and supporting the CBN\u2019s goal of achieving sustainable exchange rate stability.\n\n\u201cWe therefore conclude by urging the regulators to consider our proposal for the creation of Bureaux de change Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (BAFEX) to replicate I&E window initiative, and address concerns of stakeholders like Nigerians in Diaspora, foreign investors, international financial institutions stability of the market,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) in partnership with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has jointly released the guidelines on the submission of insurance programme by operators, project promoters, alliance partners, and Nigerian indigenous companies in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nThis is in compliance with Sections 49 and 50 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act 2010 in relation to insurance transactions.\n\nThe guidelines for the oil & gas insurance business was issued in 2010 which stipulate the roles and responsibilities of insurance institutions in ensuring compliance with local content law.\n\nThis was done with the primary consideration of ensuring that available In-Country Insurance Capacity is fully filled before any foreign consideration.\n\nThe overall aim of the guideline is the development of indigenous content through increased indigenous participation which was applauded by the entire insurance industry as it greatly complemented NAICOM roles and responsibilities in performing its regulatory and supervisory oversight function.\n\nSpeaking at the official signing and presentation of the joint guidelines by NAICOM and NCDMB, the Commissioner for Insurance and Chief Executive Officer of the NAICOM, Olorundare Sunday Thomas, said the NOGICD Act was enacted following the peculiarity of the Oil and Gas industry, which facilitated the collaboration between the NCDMB and NAICOM leading to the proactive considerations of the specific provisions of the NOGICD Act relating to the Insurance Industry.\n\nIn a similar vein, Thomas explained that Sections 49 and 50 of the NOGICD Act specifically relate to Insurance & Reinsurance and approval for offshore Insurance respectively with recommended minimum levels of Nigerian Content measured by percentage spend.\n\nHe said \u201cthe synergy between NAICOM and NCDMB necessitated a veritable platform for inter-agency collaboration in order to give effect to the requirements of Section 49 and 50 of the NOGICD Act 2010 by providing guidance to Operators in the Oil and Gas necessary for satisfying the provisions of the law in relation to insurance transactions.\n\n\u201cThe joint Guidelines which are today issued with the objectives of enforcing and strengthening compliance with the provisions of the referenced sections of the NOGICD Act and relevant provisions of the Insurance Act with respect to companies carrying on insurance business in the Nigerian oil and gas industry is to also enable the Board monitor utilization of in-country insurance capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, therefore, implore all operators, project promoters, alliance partners and Nigerian indigenous companies engaged in any form of business, operations or contract in the Nigerian oil and gas industry to note that the sighted relevant laws have demanded our adherence and continued compliance, hence the issuance of this Guidelines.\n\nThomas who expressed optimism about the realization of the benefits of increased local content of increased retention, and growth in an in-country technical capacity, stated that it will also lead to job creation and employment generation, increased penetration and GDP growth, and human capacity development, and many others.\n\nHe said Whilst noting the need to secure domestic supply chains through strong backward domestic integration which has the potency of protecting economies from imported contagion of both a health and economic variety, they are also mindful of the capacity gap of the Supply-side.\n\nHe said NAICOM is committed to creating an enabling environment that will consistently enhance the increased capacity of the Insurance Institutions both financially and technically.\n\nIn his speech, the Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Engr Simbi Kesiye Wabote, said the release of the Guidelines addresses loopholes that have been identified by the Board in implementing the provisions of the NOGICD Act, particularly sections 49 and 50.\n\nHe noted that the combined provisions of sections 49 and 50 require all operators engaged in any form of activity or project in the Oil and Gas industry to \u2018\u2019insure all insurable risks related to its oil and gas business\u2026with an insurance company, through an insurance broker registered in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nWabote said the Act provides that where an operator seeks to place an insurable risk offshore, written approval of NAICOM must first be sought and obtained.\n\nThe essence of the above provisions of the NOGICD Act, he said, was to ensure the full utilization of available in-country capacity in the Insurance sector before seeking offshore insurance services to support retention of capital in-country and build the capacity of Nigerian insurance companies in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe expressed optimism that \u201cthe implementation of this Insurance Guidelines will further strengthen the Board\u2019s local content drive by ensuring that a greater portion of the spend in the Insurance industry as it relates to oil and gas activities in Nigeria is retained in-country.\u201d\n\nWabote said the implementation of the guideline \u201cwill lead to more value addition and usage of Nigerian insurance firms and insurance brokers registered in Nigeria.\u201d",

I also read the judgement. Malabu oil and I think strangely enough, the judge said we were not able to establish that we lost $1.7 billion.\n\n\u201cBut I also read further that the lawyer said that they are studying the judgement and they will take the appropriate step on whether to appeal or not.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the enactment of the Federal Fire and Rescue Service Establishment Act 2022.\n\nMinister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, told newsmen that the proposed law is meant to replace the old law establishing the Fire Service, which has been in existence for 60 years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Federal Executive Council today approved the repeal of the 60 year old Fire Service Act Cap F29, LFN 2004 and in its stead, the council approved the enactment of the Federal Fire and Rescue Service Establishment Act 2022, which is meant to bring into currency the operations and professionalism of the Federal Fire Service as it delivers its services to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the Council directed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to fine tune the bill for onward transmission to the National Assembly for passage.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe Attorney General was required to process and present to the National Assembly for review and ultimate passage and we expect that the law, when eventually passed and approved by the President will help in improving the capability and capacity of the Federal fire Service\u201d.\n\nAlso briefing, Works and Housing Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola, said FEC also approved N66.9 billion for the rehabilitation of Kashimbila-Takum-Chahchangi road in Taraba State, North-East Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Ministry of Works and Housing presented one memorandum and it was for the rehabilitation of the 91.94 kilometre Kashimbila-Takum-Chahchangi road in Taraba State and council approved the proposal by the ministry in the sum of N66.983 billion.\u201d\n\nFashola said the project will help boost the transportation network in Taraba State and the entire North-East.\n\nThe Council also approved N23.9 billion for the procurement of equipment for airports across the country.\n\nBriefing on behalf of the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the equipment to be procured include radio communication system for some control towers and instrument landing systems for some airports.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe Minister of Aviation presented two memos, one was for the award of contract for the upgrade of twelve airports tower voice communication and control system radio for twelve airports located in Akure, Benin, Calabar, Ibadan, Ilorin, Jos, Minna, Owerri, Sokoto, Yola, Kaduna and Enugu.\n\n\u201cThe contract was for the sum of N9.988 billion with a completion period of 13 months. As you are aware, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency NAMA has a statutory mandate to enhance safety and security of the Nigerian airspace and it is in line with this that it sought to upgrade 12 air control towers voice and communication control system.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the communication tower had to be upgraded because the ones currently in use have aged and also to enhance better performance in the 12 airports in line with technological advancements and aviation industry\u2019s best practices..\n\nHe added that N14 billion for the procurement of instrument landing systems for Lagos Abuja, Katsina and Portharcourt airports.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThe Ministry of Aviation also sought and obtained approval for the award of contract fir the procurement and installation of air field lighting category three instrument landing systems in Lagos, Abuja, Katsina and Portharcourt airports.\n\n\u201cThis has to do with safety. The memo was approved and contract was awarded in the sum of 14,036,000,000. This is in a bid to carryout statutory mandate of developing and managing all relevant aviation services for safe secure and efficient carriage of passengers and goods.\u201d\n\nHe also said the move was necessitated by the recent increase in the fleet of passengers across the four airports.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. But I want to assure you that a lot is going on behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cAnd I think probably the Minister of Education will be better positioned to give the details. But like any government, if we\u2019re not concerned, we would not set up all the committees which have been working on.

The purpose of the memo is to provide each senatorial district in the country with e-learning provision, each states has three senatorial districts and the FCT has one senatorial district\n\n\u201cThe scope of the project is the provision of satellite based education system for about 4,360 users in the 109 senatorial districts and it was through the installation of 109 receiver satellite unit model antenna in three schools in each state.\n\n\u201cInstallation and provision of 109 vast mile server in three schools in each state connecting up to 100 device installation of 109 server units for receiver terminals and deployment of 4,360 Android tablets.\u201d",

Given the importance of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden as an international maritime and trade corridor linking the poles of the East and West, the Kingdom has sought to establish this.\u201d\n\nThe President of the ECOWAS Commission, Jean Claude Kassi-Brou said he is happy with the interest from Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe noted that of particular interest is the help the region will be receiving from Saudi Arabia in the fight against terrorism which is fast becoming a major challenge in the area.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "A state-of-the-art Secure Evidence Storage Facility would soon be at the disposal of the Nigeria Police Force courtesy of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) with funding from the United States Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)\n\nA statement on Wednesday by UNODC read: \u201cToday, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime with funding from the United States Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) commenced the groundbreaking ceremony to establish a state-of-the-art Secure Evidence Storage Facility at the Nigeria Police Force Criminal Investigation Division Headquarters in Garki, Abuja.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, the event kicks off a wide-ranging project funded by the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) to support the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in the collection and forensic exploitation of physical evidence.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe initial focus of this project is on Federal Capital Territory and four states in the Northeast region, but it will soon also be extended to additional states in the North West and North Central regions.\n\n\u201cThe project is being delivered by both Nigerian and international experts from UNODC, the UN\u2019s lead agency on supporting law enforcement activity. The goal is to strengthen police efforts to apprehend terrorists, kidnappers, and other violent criminals, and ultimately to secure convictions within a rule of law framework. In addition to refurbishing several NPF evidence storage facilities, the project team will also work with Nigerian police investigators and crime scene specialists to build their capacity to collect and analyze evidence such as fingerprints, tool marks, digital data, ballistics, and biological material.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks at the occasion, United States Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard highlighted the importance of successfully prosecuting serious criminal offences, noting: \u201cEvidence is key to the success of any investigation; Improper handling of evidence can have detrimental effects on establishing rule of law. The refurbishment of evidence facilities in seven north central and northeast states as well as the Criminal Investigation Division in the Federal Capital Territory will enhance the Nigeria Police Force\u2019s ability to properly maintain the integrity of physical evidence in its care; and will lead to more evidence-based investigations and successful prosecution of terrorist groups and other serious crimes.\u201d\n\nThe Chief of UNODC\u2019s Terrorism Prevention Branch, Masood Karimipour, added: \u201cSolving crimes requires skill, painstaking investigation, science and patience. This project aims to help the Nigeria Police Force recover forensic evidence of crime and terrorism, to exploit these clues to identify and prosecute suspects, and to help prosecutors present stronger cases in court, in line with international standards.\u201d\n\nCommissioner of Police Tony Olofu, representing the IGP, said: \u201cI want to thank UNODC and the US for their most welcome support and sincerely impress on them both that they can embrace us as a willing partner in the fight against terrorism and other heinous crimes.\u201d\n\nThe launch event was also attended by a wide range of key partners in this effort, including representatives from the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria, and the Office of the National Security Adviser, who all delivered goodwill messages supporting this initiative.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cUNODC\u2019s Strategic Vision for Nigeria takes our partnership with the government of Nigeria to a new level in our shared mission to tackle crime, drugs, terrorism and corruption and their effects on the economy, environment, and people.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
