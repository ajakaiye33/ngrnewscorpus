My second wife in Nigeria already warned me that I was going to suffer because this country is not a place for me to work.\n\n\u201cShe said if I\u2019m not a hypocrite I can never achieve anything in this country.

          "title": "This is why Pastor Adefarasin is scared",
          "text": "\u201cAnd Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. \u2013 Genesis 10: 8, 9.\n\nBefore now, I did not want to comment on the brouhaha that erupted when Pastor Paul Adefarasin of the House on the Rock Church, told his members, in a sermon, to have a Plan B out of Nigeria; which has been universally interpreted as an \u201cabandon ship\u201d order. It is assumed that the ship of the Nigerian state is sinking fast, and any reasonable captain would tell his passengers to bail out. However, when I realised that many commentators, for lack of ecclesiastical training, were not able to situate the man of God\u2019s warning from an Eschatological point of view, I found it imperative to weigh in.\n\nFor one, nobody should take any counsel from a true man of God lightly. Adefarasin is as true as they come. Indeed, for an ordinary human being to exercise supernatural leadership over thousands of souls is enough to show that the person in question is in touch with a higher realm of reality. Even if he does not go about with the bubbly title of prophet hanging on his shoulders, he is in fact a prophet. There is something supernatural he sees that makes ordinary men see him as a medium of the supernatural.\n\nThis is why when such a spiritual leader makes a proclamation, or takes the pain to dramatise his prophecy, the public must pay attention. The Bible tells the story of Ezekiel, who proclaimed that the people of Israel would come back from captivity, and in order to show that he believed in his own prophecy, he bought a piece of land. The logic is that you can only invest in real estate when you believe that the land could actually be yours, and that the value would appreciate in the future. In the same vein, Adefarasin informed his members that his wife was already working on his own Plan B. The prophet has invested; we must take note.\n\nThat takes us to the question of the veracity of the prophetic clarion call. Those who criticised Adefarasin were only taking peripheral shots. They believed he should have only words of hope and encouragement for his congregants, and for Nigerians. But to view it in this fashion would miss the point. Instead of casting ministers of God in the classical leadership mould, we must look at their source. Their utterances emanate from the supernatural, and even if they do not specifically say it, their ecclesiastical office makes it a given. Hence, we must not judge them, rather we could interrogate the \u201cspirit\u201d that is \u201cbankrolling\u201d their prophecy.\n\nThis is where Eschatology comes in. Derived from the Latin word \u201ceschatos\u201d, meaning \u201cfinal\u201d, Eschatology is the doctrine of the last things. It was originally a Western term, referring to Jewish, Christian, and Muslim beliefs about the end of history, the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment, the Messianic era, and the problem of theodicy (the vindication of God\u2019s justice). But because it is highly exclusive knowledge, it has become the secret doctrine which only core religious leaders are privy to. Every religion has it. Splinter denominations and sects spring up when new Eschatologies are revealed to potential founders.\n\nYou can trace every man of God\u2019s revelation to an Eschatology. And because religion is \u201cthe opium of the people\u201d, the former colonial powers ensured that they guided Africa\u2019s religious leaders\u2019 Eschatology. When they landed, they came in with Eurocentric Eschatologists. The same way, when the Arabs came through Jihad, they came in with Asiacentric Eschatologists. And now that our religious leaders have arrived, they, inadvertently, play according to the script written centuries ago by European hegemonists and Arabian usurpers.\n\nMany of our Pentecostal and Protestant preachers embraced Dominionism (Kingdom Now Theology) \u2013 with its end-time worldwide Christian government Eschatology \u2013 just as some of our Muslim teachers embraced Salafism \u2013 with its Islamic Worldwide Caliphate Eschatology. Now that the two worlds are about to clash, guess who is the cry baby?\n\nIt is not about Biafra, Oduduwa or Arewa. It is about taking down the biggest economy in Africa, stealing our resources and confiscating our Afrocentric heritage for good. Europe had overrun us already, China is here now, India is coming. Later, Arab will enter through the backdoor.\n\nThose Western preachers that gave our men of God their messages had ensured that anything Africa was painted black. In the scripture I quoted at the beginning of the column, there is a mention of an illustrious African, Nimrod. The Bible described this son of Cush as a mighty man before the Lord \u2013 the same position that Abraham enjoyed, when God commanded him to \u201cwalk before me\u2026.\u201d There was a man that walked \u201cbefore\u201d God, even before Abraham was born. That man is Nimrod, a black African.\n\nRead Also\n\nBut because Western theologians were the ones who decided how to apply these revealed knowledge, they ensured that the narrative about this African father of faith was painted dark and diabolical. Through what is called \u201cChurch tradition\u201d, the narrative that Nimrod was the father of idolatry was injected. Although the Bible does not specifically mention the sins of Nimrod, these European Bible scholars made it a point of duty to impart this odious tale in \u201cBible Schools\u201d. That is why our clerics fall over themselves to demonise Nimrod and his legacy.\n\nWhat is more, in modern North American English, the term \u201cnimrod\u201d is now used to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person; a usage first recorded in 1932 and popularised by American pop culture and its globally influential media. What nonsense!\n\nThis is why these men of God are scared. They do not have any African heritage except gore, goof and guile. Their Eschatology is Eurocentric. The Western world had blindfolded them, and now that our home is about to burn, their Plan B is not even the Rapture of the Saints (which is the Biblically correct plan B), but the asylum camps of Europe and America. Pity on us!\n\nIf not for the fact that their Eschatology has been twisted by American Evangelical theologians, they would have known that the real, Biblical Plan B will be found in 2 Thessalonians 2:2-12 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-58. The Eschatology according to Paul is that before the antichrist takes over the world\u2019s government, Jesus Christ would come \u201cin the air\u201d and \u201csnatch away\u201d the true believers, so that they would later return with Him to defeat the antichrist in the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 19:11-21).\n\nAnd for those Africans on the other side of the divide \u2013 the Muslims \u2013 they too would wake up to the harsh reality that we all have been used and dumped by foreign invaders who pretended to teach us how to get to Heaven while grabbing our Earth. They would become slaves in their own land.\n\nThis is why we must rewrite our Eschatology. The codes are already written thousands of years ago, right there in the holy books. It is only left for us to decode and then illuminate where the missionaries-cum-colonialists obfuscated. We can start by realising that the Bible says in Isaiah 19:19 that at the end of the age (where we are at the moment), the altar of God shall move from Israel to Africa. That Africa shall become the new Holy Land, a new destination, and the centre of the world. Therefore, where Adefarasin sees gloom, I see glory. Where he sees a Plan B, I see the reinvention of the Plan A. This is home; there is nowhere to run!\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Replacing burnt facilities in the prevailing economic circumstances\u2019ll be a tall order, Yakubu lamentsl3 INEC offices burnt in 3 Ebonyi LGAs\n\n\u2026We suspect APC \u2013 PDP\n\n\u2026APC keeps mum\n\n\u2026 INEC\u2019s alarm, a grand conspiracy \u2013 CSOs\n\n\u2026Stop burning police stations, killing your brothers, AIG Zone 9 tells S-East stakeholders\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, Peter Okutu, Dirisu Yakubu & Luminous Jannamike\n\nTHE Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has again decried the continued attacks on its offices in some parts of the country, fearing that the spate of arson has degenerated to a crisis capable of derailing its preparations for the 2023 general elections.\n\nINEC spoke on a day three of its offices in Ebonyi, Ezza North and Izzi local government areas of Ebonyi State were set ablaze by arsonists.\n\nBurning of INEC offices elicited sharp reactions from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and some civil society organisations. While the PDP said it is suspicious of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, the CSOs decried the government\u2019s alleged silence and feared that a grand conspiracy might be afoot to harm the 2023 polls and the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, at press time yesterday was yet to react.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, spoke yesterday in Abuja at an emergency meeting with the commission\u2019s state Resident Electoral Commissioners, RECs.\n\nAccording to Yakubu, some events in the recent past have challenged the Commission and adversely affected its commitment to improving the electoral process.\n\nSpate of attacks worrying \u2014 INEC chair, Yakubu\n\nHis words: \u201cThe spate of arson and vandalism targeting the Commission\u2019s facilities and property has become profoundly worrisome.\n\n\u201cSurely, these attacks are no longer freak events but appear to be quite orchestrated and targeted at INEC. Clearly, these are acts of unjustifiable aggression which may undermine the Commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and dent the nation\u2019s electoral process.\u201d\n\nYakubu added that unfortunately it has been on the rise since the 2019 general elections \u201cbut has now developed into a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the last three weeks or so, three of our local government offices in Essien Udim in Akwa Ibom State, Ohafia in Abia State and Udenu in Enugu State have been set ablaze by unidentified persons.\n\n\u201cLast Sunday, 16th May 2021, our state office in Enugu suffered yet another arson and vandalism in which parts of the building were ransacked and several vehicles razed. And more of our facilities are being systematically targeted and attacked. Just last night, Tuesday 18th May 2021, two more offices in Ebonyi and Ezza North Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State were burnt down.\n\n\u201cAlthough there were no casualties, the damage to the physical infrastructure and electoral materials was total. Nothing has been salvaged from ballot boxes and voting cubicles to generating sets and office furniture and equipment.\n\n\u201cThe facilities of the Commission are there to serve the local communities for the most fundamental aspect of democratic governance, which is elections. Therefore, targeting such important national assets and repositories of electoral materials that took time and enormous resources to procure cannot be justified.\n\n\u2018Replacing burnt facilities\u2019ll be tough\u2019\n\n\u201cReplacing these facilities in the prevailing economic circumstances will indeed be a tall order, thereby adversely affecting electoral services in the same communities. These facilities are not only limited to voting but also used for other critical electoral activities such as voter registration, the coordination of stakeholder engagements and voter education and sensitisation,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the INEC chairman, the commission will certainly work with the security agencies to deal with the perpetrators of these heinous crimes according to the law.\n\n\u201cTo this end, a meeting with all the security agencies is holding on Monday 24th May 2021.\n\nHowever, it has become imperative to call on all and sundry, particularly communities where these assets are located, to see themselves as owners and custodians of these facilities and assist the Commission in protecting them. I am glad that some of them are already doing so.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the attacks must be stopped urgently to forestall disruptions to several upcoming electoral activities, particularly the Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, exercise which INEC plans to undertake continuously in 2,673 centres nationwide for a period of over one year. What is left is to finalise the newly established Polling Units in order to update our registration software to make them available to registrants.\u201d\n\nHow 3 INEC offices in Ebonyi were set ablaze\n\nINEC announced the burning of its offices in Ebonyi on Tuesday night through its Twitter handle.\n\nThe tweet read: \u201cLast night, Tuesday 18th May 2021, two INEC offices in Ebonyi and Ezza North Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State were burnt down by unidentified persons. No casualties but extensive damages to the building and facilities.\u201d\n\nVanguard learned that sensitive documents and other valuables worth millions of naira were reportedly burnt to ashes by the criminals.\n\nThis development is the latest in a series of attacks on offices of the electoral body across the country, especially in the South-East region.\n\nThe attacks came about 24 hours after the INEC management held an emergency security meeting with all security agencies to curb the burning of its offices across the country.\n\nAt least 25 offices of INEC have been gutted by fire in the last two years, including incidences in Akwa Ibom (four); Abia (three); Anambra (two) and Imo (two). Confirming the destruction of the three INEC offices in Ebonyi, the State Public Relations Officer of INEC, Mr. Ali Cornelius Sunday said he received calls from electoral officers about the destruction that took place in their LGAs.\n\nAccording to him, the incident has been reported to the Ebonyi Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC and security agencies in the state for further action.\n\nWe\u2019re suspicious of APC \u2013 PDP\n\nReacting to the development, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, expressed concern over what it called the silence of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in the wake of the growing attacks on INEC offices.\n\nPDP image maker, Kola Ologbondiyan said the APC is playing the ostrich knowing that there is no way it would win elections \u201chaving been rejected by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are worried as a political party that the APC is silent in spite of the various attacks on INEC offices and damages to electoral materials. We are very worried and we are suspicious that the APC having failed Nigerians and realizing that they cannot win subsequent elections are responsible for this chaos and are creating emergency situations to forestall conduct of subsequent elections.\n\n\u201cWe are worried that the Federal Government has not said anything even though over 20 INEC offices have so far been burnt. A government that is responsible for the protection of a democracy will not be silent. It should be concerned,\u201d said Mr. Ologbondiyan.\n\nHe called on well-meaning Nigerians to speak up, saying the regularity of the attacks shows that there is conspiracy to derail the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nINEC\u2019s alarm over threat to undermine 2023 election, a grand conspiracy \u2013 CSOs\n\nAlso, some Civil Society Organizations, CSOs, said that INEC\u2019s alarm raised over alleged threats to the 2023 elections reeks of a grand conspiracy by some state actors to undermine the process.\n\nThe convener, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, Ariyo Dare-Atoye, in a chat with Vanguard, said since the government has been unwilling to deploy basic intelligence to unravel the root cause of the attacks and arrest the arsonists attacking INEC facilities, it would be difficult to absolve the state.\n\nHis words: \u201cThere is a grand conspiracy to undermine the 2023 general elections either by some devious elements plotting to extend the stay of the current regime beyond 2023 or by some terrible agents of secessionists trying to make a statement or by those who want to occupy the South-East and undermine the zone, thinking the Biafra war is still on.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cSince the state is unwilling to deploy basic intelligence to unravel the root cause of these attacks and apprehend the perpetrators, it would be difficult to absolve the state.\n\n\u201cWhat the current reality suggests to INEC is that it must now prioritise technology in terms of putting its structures and assets under security surveillance, HiTech CCTV Cameras and negotiate its own security outfits for the protection of electoral assets.\n\n\u201cThe volatile nature of the emerging situation in the country also indicates that we will not have the luxury of the usual multi-level collation of results, but we must now embark on electronic transmission of votes. I urge INEC to consult widely, including members of the civil society, to share knowledge and ideas.\u201d\n\nGovt has run out of ideas to manage forthcoming elections \u2014 Centre for Liberty\n\nOn his part, Adebayo Raphael, Co-Convener Centre for Liberty, said the rise in the attacks on INEC offices could be an indication that the government has run out of ideas to manage forthcoming elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe rise in attacks is truly disturbing. To me, it seems there are two possibilities here: One is, some people are deliberately targeting INEC in order to weaken its capacity for coordinating and supervising the next cycle of elections.\n\n\u201cThe goal may probably be to ensure that the election does not hold on the set date which INEC has already announced, thereby forcing the umpire to reschedule the elections, and no doubt benefitting the selfish interest of some people who may be trying to maintain the power status quo, or dismantle it completely.\n\n\u201cTwo is, this may be a way for some interests to completely weaken the ability of the Nigerian state to function, and perhaps for it to exist at all. But the downside to this is that it may create an opportunity for elements with undemocratic intent, to swoop in and capture the state\u2019s democratic institutions under the false pretense of salvaging the state. Whilst this may be an intent some people already nurture, these incidents of incendiary nature are certainly going to solidify the opportunity to make it a reality.\n\n\u201cIn any case, it is obvious the current regime has run out of effective ideas to manage the state, and it is only honorable that the state allows more capable hands to continue, else some other people might swoop in uninvited, and that will be bad for the Nigerian state, its democracy, or its ability to remain in existence.\u201d\n\nStop burning police stations, killing your brothers, AIG Zone 9 tells S-East stakeholders\n\nMeantime, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 9 headquarters, Umuahia, AIG Ene Okon, yesterday, charged stakeholders to discourage the killing of security agencies and burning of Police stations within the South-East region of the country.\n\nThe AIG stated this during an interactive session with stakeholders including traditional rulers, the leadership of tricycle and Okada operators, youth organizations, Hotel associations in Ebonyi State at the International Conference Centre, Abakaliki.\n\nThe Police boss who added that the funds earmarked for rebuilding police stations would have served in the execution of other forms of developmental projects in the region enjoined community leaders to synergize with security agencies to address the spate of insecurity in the country. His words: \u201cWe are here so that we can find out how Police can serve you better. This stakeholders\u2019 meeting is basically for you. We want to serve you better. Ebonyi has been transformed unlike how it was many years ago.\n\n\u201cIn any agrarian society you must expect pockets of communal clashes. These criminals are operating within your community. They are your brothers and sisters. 80 per cent of policemen in the South-East are Igbo. When you kill a policeman, you have killed your brother.\n\n\u201cIt is your brother that you are killing in the Police. After killing your brother who will now police you? The money used in rebuilding police stations would have been used for other developmental projects. At the end of killing security operatives, criminals will turn around to kill you. Let\u2019s maintain peace in our community.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Aliyu Garba, who welcomed the stakeholders to the interactive session explained that the Police will record more successes through collaboration with the people of the state. He assured that information released to the Police by members of the public will be handled with utmost confidentiality.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Attacks on police formation and it\u2019s operatives in the southeast of Nigeria has continued unabated, with the lastest killing of two officers at Ubakala Police Station in Umuahia South Local Government Area of Abia State by yet-to-be identified gunmen.\n\nIt was gathered that unknown gunmen attacked the Ubakala Police Station early Monday morning in Umuahia South area of the state.\n\nThe bandits razed the main building of the police station, five patrol vans, six exhibit vehicles, motorcycles and tricycles, and as well carted away two rifles belonging to the slain policemen.\n\nThe latest onslaught by the gunmen on the security formation was coming barely three days, after some hoodlums had set ablaze a police station at Ubani township Market in Umuahia North Local Government of Abia State.\n\nThe hoodlums had equally unleashed similar nefarious attack and burnt the office of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NLDEA) in Amaekpu in Ohafia LGA last Tuesday. Two days earlier, gunmen razed the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s (INEC) office in Ohafia.\n\nUnrelenting in their attacks on police stations and government facilities, the unknown hoodlums numbering about 100, attacked Bende police station in Abia, leaving two operatives with gunshot wounds.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that the hoodlums set the station on fire about 11pm on 12th May, 2021.\n\nThe Police Command in Abia State had confirmed the attack by the hoodlums.\n\nThe Spokesman of the state command, SP Godfrey Ogbonna had said two officers were shot in the legs by the attackers.\n\nOgbonna said the attackers also burnt down the generator house and a multi-purpose building, belonging to Bende Local Government.\n\nHe said the hoodlums later released criminal suspects, who were detained at the station.\n\n\u201cThey also burnt two vehicles, including the Divisional Police Officer\u2019s Highlander Jeep and three motorcycles parked at the station.\n\n\u201cWe do not know yet how they all gathered to execute the attack at the station.\n\n\u201cMaybe, they parked their vehicles away from their target and walked through footpaths to the place,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso recall that at the earlier stage of the criminal attacks in Abia State, unknown individuals reportedly razed down a police station in Uzuakoli, Bende local government area.\n\nIt was further gathered that the incident occurred in the early hours of May 3rd, 2021 when the assailants invaded the station.\n\nDisclosing some of the approaches in nipping in the bud the worsening attacks on security facilities and government critical infrastructures by the assailants in Abia, the State Police Command reiterated its avowed commitment and determination to make Abia an unsafe haven for criminal elements.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officers in the State, SP Godfrey Ogbonna said the command has embarked on full investigations into the recent gunmen attacks in different parts of the state.\n\nThe Command also disclosed its synergy with sister security agencies to curb every nooks and crannies of the state of hoodlums, kidnappers and bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the parts of the government\u2019s proactive measures in dealing with the criminal monsters threatening the peace of Abia populaces, during one of his official engagements, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu vowed that his administration shall use every lawful means to protect and safeguard every inch of the territory of Abia State from criminals and marauders.\n\nHe described Abia State as a safe haven for investors and business operatives.\n\nThe Abia Governor further revealed that the improved security situation in the State, coupled with access roads created by his administration had increased businesses, while government has also provided enabling environment for business to thrive.\n\nHowever, despite Governor Ikpeazu\u2019s statement, rating Abia as safe haven for its citizenry and business investors, coupled with his administration\u2019s proactive steps in quelling attacks on security formations by the hoodlums, the yet-to-be identified individuals have continuously and steadily launched attacks on police stations, and in extension, government infrastructures including the branch offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state.\n\nFollowing the unabated criminal attacks on security agencies and their operatives by the unknown assailants in some parts of Abia, blames and counter-blames over who is responsible for the current activities of of the unknown gunmen in the state have emerged.\n\nObservers are of different opinions. While some have accused the opposition elements of being behind the several attacks on security formations and government facilities by the unknown gunmen as part of their grand plots to sabotage the gains and progress already achieved by the Abia Government in the security of lives and property, others have observed that the proscribed group in the southeast zone, the Indigeneous People of Biafra (IPOB) and it\u2019s security outfit, Eastern Security Network (ESN) are behind the current killings of security personnel and the burning down of Local Government Area division offices of INEC and NDLEA.\n\nThey equally posited that members of the proscribed IPOB were allegedly carrying out the heinous attacks on security formations to mop up the police arms and ammunition and use the armouries to further fortify personnel of ESN to sustain the their attacks in various states of the southeast geopolitical zone.\n\nHowever, investigation conducted by DAILY POST on Wednesday, following the attacks on several locations across Abia State, gathered that the attacks on security formations and government facilities resulted from the alleged brutality of the Nigeria police against pro-biafra agitators during and after the military invasion of the Umuahia residence of the leader of the Indigeneous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. Most of the Biafra agitators mostly in Aba axis of Abia recalled their earlier vow to make southeast zone ungovernable for the five governors in the region, who they believed were aiding and abetting Nigeria security forces in the continuous killing of pro-biafra agitators.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the continuous detention of most of biafra faithful, and refusal of the governments at all levels to unconditionally release IPOB members arrested during its military invasion in Afaraukwu Umuahia, and remanded in prisons across southeast and other parts of the regions without diligent and fair trails which in turns infringed their rights to freedom of association or right to seek self determination as provided by conventional laws, were part of the major factors that led to the current insecurity situation in the state, making the nation\u2019s security operatives and their formations as targets and victims.\n\nDAILY POST investigation further revealed that the current upsurge of attacks on government\u2019s critical infrastructures in Abia and other states of southeast was compounded by the killing of prominent ESN Commander, Ikonso Don by the soldiers invited by the government. The pro-biafra group and agitators have vowed not to ceasefire till justice prevails on the murder of the ESN commander and the extra judicial killings of hundreds of biafra agitators.\n\nMeanwhile, in the course of the investigation on Wednesday, normalcy has returned to the affected places as different combined teams of security agents were stationed in strategic areas to forestall further attacks on the state by the0 unknown gunmen.\n\nBut worried by the worsening attacks in the state, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu had on Monday, met with members of his cabinet in Aba to deliberate on additional measures needed to ensure the protection of lives and property in the state. Briefing newsmen after the meeting which was attended by the Deputy Governor, Rt Hon Ude Oko Chukwu, and other members of the state executive council, the Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, stated that the state government was set to organize a security roundtable involving key stakeholders in the state to review the prevailing situation and recommend measures to further improve security in the State.\n\nAccording to him, the roundtable which is expected to last for 36 hours, will hold in Umuahia the state capital, and is expected to bring together serving and retired security officers of Abia origin, Chairmen of Local Government Areas and Traditional Rulers with a view to recommending lasting solutions to the challenges of insecurity affecting the state in particular and the nation in general.\n\nAs the attacks on security formations continue unabated, Abia citizens and residents are looking up to the State government under Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu to redouble its efforts and ensure decisive steps are taken to end the series of attacks occurring in some parts of the state, almost on daily basis.",
          "summary": "It was gathered that unknown gunmen attacked the Ubakala Police Station early Monday morning in Umuahia South area of the state.\nUnrelenting in their attacks on police stations and government facilities, the unknown hoodlums numbering about 100, attacked Bende police station in Abia, leaving two operatives with gunshot wounds.\nThe Police Command in Abia State had confirmed the attack by the hoodlums.\nAlso recall that at the earlier stage of the criminal attacks in Abia State, unknown individuals reportedly razed down a police station in Uzuakoli, Bende local government area.\nHe described Abia State as a safe haven for investors and business operatives.",

          "text": "As reactions continue to trail Nigerian Senate President\u2019s anti-restructuring comment, member representing Afikpo North/South Federal Constituency, Hon. Igariwey Iduma Enwo said, Ohanaeze Ndigbo overreacted by calling for Lawan\u2019s resignation or sack.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Abuja on Wednesday, the lawmaker maintained that the Senate President, like every other Nigerian has his personal opinion to express.\n\nHe said that Lawan\u2019s comment about restructuring was his personal opinion that doesn\u2019t reflect the position of Nigeria\u2019s parliament in any way.\n\nLawan, while reacting to Southern governors\u2019 demand for the restructuring of the nation and ban on open grazing tongue lashed the governors for the demand, saying as elected leaders, they shouldn\u2019t have said so.\n\nBut Hon. Enwo said people should exercise patience and take advantage of the constitution review that is in the works which he believes would address Nigerians\u2019 demands.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy opinion which is my view is that Ohana eze Ndigbo shouldn\u2019t read much into what the Senate President said. The reason is that the Senate President merely expressed his opinion. His opinion doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the position of the National Assembly.\n\nNow, the National Assembly has a committee to review the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President is not even a member of that committee and he is not going to chair the committee. The committee would be chaired by the Deputy Speaker and I want to believe that we run a bicameral parliament so like any other lawmaker, the opinion of any member does not necessarily mean the position of the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t read meaning much into it. There will be a lot of topical issues to be debated and members are going to take positions on those issues.\n\n\u201cAs an opposition member from the South East, my views are going to be reflected and that of my people; it\u2019s also going to reflect the position of my party and that\u2019s why I said people shouldn\u2019t read much into what the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan has said and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to call for his resignation.\n\nThe lawmaker further noted that the process of lawmaking in a bicameral legislature which Nigeria practices was tedious that nobody can import his sentiments into it, noting that Nigerians shouldn\u2019t allay fears for any reason.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has a process to lawmaking which is covered under section 58 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cWhen a member of the parliament introduces a bill, I often get amused when seeing people attacking the sponsor of that bill, saying did you do this or that? It is an idea merely and it doesn\u2019t mean every bill introduced would see the light of the day.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean other lawmakers are going to be persuaded. It\u2019s a long process passing through first reading second and third reading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to go through committee\u2019s public hearing before going to the executive for assent and all that. Because Senate President is a member of Parliament, at the end of the day, whatever he said is personal.\n\n\u201cNigerian people may think the 9th National Assembly is weak and draw conclusion as such, but if you ask me, the National Assembly always acts in the best interest of the nation.\n\n\u201cFor example, some of us who are members of the Constitution Review which I think I can speak for is that there is so much expectation from the Nigerian people. Nigerians believe there is so much fundamental things to happen, otherwise, the outcome may not be acceptable to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Nigerians are expecting the usual incremental constitution review exercise. I think topical and thematic issues must be considered which I think would go a long way in satisfying the expectations of the people. This is an opportunity for us to diffuse tension in the country both in assuaging the feelings of people we represent.\n\n\u201cAn exercise has been given to the National Assembly, so let there be patience and wait for the outcome.\n\n\u201cHowever, people\u2019s view of the 9th Assembly doesn\u2019t matter, but what is at stake now is that we have a very important assignment before us and we are going to carry it out to the satisfaction of the Nigerian people.\n\nOn the fears that the constitution review will not seeing the light of the day, Hon. Igariwey said, past failures in getting the constitution reviewed shouldn\u2019t be the basis for not carrying out the exercise.\n\n\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t judge the past because life is dynamic generally. Circumstances change, there are certain things governors wouldn\u2019t accept in the past, but they will accept them now.\n\n\u201cYou can see many examples of what I\u2019m trying to say. There are things that become much more urgent now that if we don\u2019t solve them now, we will have problems.\n\nMeanwhile, attempt to have Senator Gershom Bassey (PDP) representing Cross River South Senatorial district to speak on calls for Ahmad Lawan head failed.\n\nWhen the topic was introduced for him to speak, he said: \u201cNo, its a sensitive issue, I won\u2019t speak. Ahmad Lawan is my friend.\u201d",

Within the context of the freedoms expressed in our constitution\u2026enshrined in our constitution, can you deny the rights of a Nigerian? For example, it is as good as saying, maybe, the northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? He said.\n\n\u201cDoes it hold water for a northern governors to come out saying they now prohibit spear parts trading in the North? Look, if you are talking about a constitutionally guaranteed rights, it is to go back to ensure the constitution is amended.\n\n\u201cThe freedom of movement, among others, is established in the constitution.\n\n\u201cIf by an inch you want to have any compromise over it, the better approach is to go back to the national [and sponsor a motion for] open grazing to be prohibited and see whether you will have the desired support for constitutional amendment in that respect but it is indeed a dangerous position for any Governor in Nigeria to think that he can bring about any compromise\u2026any compromise on the freedom and liberty and freedom of individuals to move around.\u201d",

          "text": "By Precious Igbonwelundu, Halima Balogun and Dorcas Aluko\n\nCommandant, Kofi Anan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) Maj.-Gen. Francis Ofori has blamed the crisis in Libya on sophisticated piracy and other armed violence in the Gulf of Guinea (GOG) .\n\nHe spoke at the inauguration of a five-day maritime security training for key maritime law enforcement agencies in Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nElaborating on the issue during a side interview, Ofori emphasised that as long as Libya remained unstable, criminality in the GOG would continue, noting that the criminals were now more sophisticated because of weapons entering the gulf region from Libya.\n\n\u201cAs long as Libya remains unstable, criminalities in the Gulf of Guinea will continue. I made that comment with respect to the sophistication with which these criminals engage at sea and anybody who is following the situation in Libya knows there is a proliferation of weapons in the Sahel as a result of instability in Libya.\n\n\u201cThat is the context in which I made the comment. Once these weapons find space in the Sahel, definitely they will find space in the sub-western African region along the littoral states \u2013 Ghana, Benin Republic, Nigeria, Cameroon and those along the coast.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, the pirates are getting more sophisticated because of the weapons that might be coming largely from Libya and then also some procure through other means,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nation reports that the KAIPTC training was done in collaboration with the Nigerian Navy (NN), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Japanese Government to boast capacity of maritime law enforcers.\n\nOfori said the training held in Nigeria as a result of the country\u2019s geo-strategic importance in the fight against maritime criminality in the GOG.\n\n\u201cDespite the potential offered by the Gulf of Guinea in terms of its rich resources and also as a critical maritime transport route, the region is bedevilled with a myriad of challenges that impede developmental efforts, and ultimately, the human security of the people in the region.\n\n\u201cThe latest report from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) indicates that incidents in the Gulf of Guinea are particularly dangerous as over 80% of attackers were armed with sophisticated weapons.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the region accounted for 96 per cent of crew kidnappings globally. Since 2019, the Gulf of Guinea has experienced an unprecedented rise in the number of multiple crew kidnappings.\u201d\n\nThe IMB report also showed a rapid expansion of piracy and armed robbery operations into nine countries in the region including, Nigeria, Benin Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Sao Tome and Principe, and Gabon, targeting a variety of vessels to include tankers, container ships, general cargo vessels, fishing vessels, passenger vessels, and numerous vessels supporting oil drilling and production.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the pirates have become more organised, more sophisticated in their efforts. All these maritime crimes are ongoing and increasing at a rate not matched by the response capacities of states. \u201cThe pervasiveness of maritime security threats across the region therefore illustrates the need for a holistic approach to maritime security response in the region. Sustainable development of the blue economy, improvement of the wellbeing of coastal communities and commitment and collaboration across agencies and governments therefore becomes key in reducing maritime insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d said Ofori.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier, the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral Jason Gbassa, said the need for safeguarding sea transport especially while observing COVID-19 protocols was increasing.\n\nThe FOC who was represented by Chief Staff Officer (CSO), Naval Training Command, Rear Admiral Monday Kohwo Unurhiere, stressed the need for cooperation amongst security agencies within the domain.\n\n\u201cA holistic approach in the management of Nigeria\u2019s maritime environment would therefore require a coordinated approach among the security agencies operating within the domain. It also calls for integrated capabilities, doctrine and interoperability.\n\n\u201cYou would agree with me that in contemporary times, the magnitude of most maritime crimes and the interlinkages among them, coupled with the diversity of impacts they produce, has necessitated calls for co-operatively framed responses in order to match our response capabilities with the increasing crime rate\u201d he said.\n\nUNDP\u2019s representative, Ms Melody Azinim reinstated the agency\u2019s commitnent to support initiatives that advance security and progressive development.\n\nShe said the UNDP has worked with KAIPTC and the Japanese Government for about 10 years in some regional projects that have resulted in a lot of development in terms of strengthening capacity of security agencies.",

          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nBandits have killed no fewer than 12 persons while 21 people were abducted in fresh attacks of some communities in Kaduna and Katsina states. A youth leader, Abashe Dauda, told Daily Sun that 11 bodies were discovered at Gaida Kaso and five others missing when gunmen launched an offensive on Gaida Kaso and Wako Kaso villages, Kakau Ward in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State, on Tuesday. He added that two other persons were shot at Wako Kaso village, but survived the attack that lasted for hours.\n\nHe said the killings in the adjoining agrarian communities were becoming tensed up daily with no tangible help from the government to salvage the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cA community called Gaida Kaso village, Kakau ward, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna state, was attacked on 18/5/2021 by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cThe attack was carried out at about 3am, houses were set ablaze, 11 persons confirmed dead and five are nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen also attacked a nearby community called Wako in Kaso Village, two were shot and sustained gunshot injury and are receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cAssemblies of God Church and one mission house were burnt down in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Kaduna State Police Command and the State\u2019s Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs are yet to make any official statement about the development as the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, on Tuesday night, armed bandits reportedly attacked Batsari town in Batsari Local Government Area in Katsina State, killing one person and abducted 21 others.\n\nAn eyewitness said that the armed bandits stormed into Batsari community at about 10:20pm and started shooting sporadically before they abducted 21 persons, mostly women and children, while a man simply identified as Alhaji Hassan was shot dead.\n\nEfforts to get the police authorities in Katsina State to comment on the incident proved abortive as the spokesperson, Gambo Isah, did not respond to calls to his phone.\n\nThe police command had, earlier on Tuesday night, confirmed the abduction of a judge, Alhaji Husaini Sama\u2019ila, by gunmen at a Shari\u2019a Court at Baure Zaka village in Safana Local Government Area of the State. The judge was said to have been kidnapped around 3:00 pm, on Tuesday, while on a personal visit to the court.\n\nThe police spokesman: \u201cAs you all know, the court has not been on the session since the commencement of the strike action embarked by the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\n\u201cThe judge took the risk and went to the court. He didn\u2019t inform the police about his going to the court, knowing fully that the place is not secured enough,\u201d he said.",

The greatest challenge today is insecurity. To travel some distance today calls for serious prayers and traveling with, perhaps, heavy security personnel because of kidnapping for ransom, ritual killing, armed robbery, insurgents attacks, banditry and other forms of violent attacks.\n\n\u201cBreaking the nation into fragments will not be the answer, rather proactiveness of those in power to guide agitators for secession to the right step; to treat the nation as one one. To do otherwise is to gamble dangerously.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, setting up of the body of security experts that will investigate the sources of ammunition that are in the hands of criminals spread all over the nation, in order to block such avenues, has not been seen to be done by the government.\n\n\u201cIt makes this a cause of concern about the sincerity of the government in nipping these evils in the bud. We want to see the criminals prosecuted. Otherwise, the government will be seen as aiding and abetting criminality.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for us to unite and speak in unison against all these evils before being wiped away by the criminals. The daily bloodshed is worrisome and must stop,\u201d he said.\n\nOlasupo also buttressed the need for government to tackle the issue of mass unemployment, which is one of the major reasons criminality thrives in the country.\n\n\u201cThe time is now for those in authority to address the problem of mass unemployment in our nation. It\u2019s the breeding ground for criminality, and equally gives the bandits and terrorists opportunity to recruit the youths into criminality with ease,\u201d he noted.\n\nIn his remarks, Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, who is also co-chairman of NIREC, emphasised that dialogue is the most effective and peaceful way for the country to reach a resolution to its problems.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s continue to work together and dialogue. I\u2019m a total believer in dialogue and nothing will change my mind, because my religion teaches me to always dialogue. If we can solve our problems without going to war, then why do we need to take up arms to solve the problem,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Two more offices set ablaze in Ebonyi\n\n\u2022Meets with security agencies May 24\n\nBy Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed concern about the spate of arson attack on its facilities, especially in the South-east, warning that it might compromise the commission\u2019s ability to conduct hitch-free elections in future.\n\nThe commission has also shifted a planned meeting with security agencies to brainstorm on protecting its assets, earlier scheduled for yesterday to Monday.\n\nThe number of INEC\u2019s facilities torched in recent months rose to 23 yesterday as hoodlums set ablaze two of the commission\u2019s offices in Ebonyi State.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), said event in the recent past like the burning of the offices and damage to the INEC property would endanger the conduct of elections in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cUnfortunately, some events in the recent past have challenged the commission and adversely affected our commitment to continue to improve the electoral process. The spate of arson and vandalism targeting the commission\u2019s facilities and property has become profoundly worrisome.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this has been on the rise since the 2019 general election but has now developed into a crisis. In the last three weeks or so, three of our local government offices in Essien Udim in Akwa Ibom State, Ohafia in Abia State and Udenu in Enugu State have been set ablaze by unidentified persons.\n\n\u201cLast Sunday, 16th May 2021, our state office in Enugu suffered yet another arson and vandalism in which parts of the building were ransacked and several vehicles razed. And more of our facilities are being systematically targeted and attacked. Just last night, Tuesday 18th May 2021, two more offices in Ebonyi and Ezza North Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State were burnt down.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although no life was lost, the damage to the physical infrastructure and electoral materials was total.\n\n\u201cNothing has been salvaged from ballot boxes and voting cubicles to generating sets and office furniture and equipment.\n\n\u201cSurely, these attacks are no longer freak events but appear to be quite orchestrated and targeted at INEC. Clearly, these are acts of unjustifiable aggression, which may undermine the commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and dent the nation\u2019s electoral process,\u201d he added.\n\nYakubu said the facilities of the commission were there to serve the local communities in exercising their franchise, adding that targeting such important national assets and repositories of electoral materials that took time and enormous resources to procure cannot be justified.\n\nHe said: \u201cReplacing these facilities in the prevailing economic circumstances will indeed be a tall order, thereby adversely affecting electoral services in the same communities. These facilities are not only limited to voting but also used for other critical electoral activities such as voter registration, the coordination of stakeholder engagements and voter education and sensitisation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the commission will work with the security agencies to deal with the perpetrators of these heinous crimes in accordance with the law.\n\nYakubu added that the meeting with RECs will take briefings from across the country on threats to INEC facilities and deliberate on how best to protect them.\n\n\u201cI believe that we can dig deep and draw from the commission\u2019s longstanding partnership with communities in this regard, in addition to depending on the invaluable support of our security agencies.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the challenges posed by these threats notwithstanding, we are still positive that we can find lasting solutions to the spate of attacks on our facilities,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe explained that this must be done quickly to forestall disruptions to upcoming electoral activities, particularly the continuous voter registration billed to hold in 2,673 centres nationwide for over one year.\n\nHowever, he said that on the positive side, the commission conducted 28 out of 32 by-elections across the country since the 2019 general election, in addition to four end-of tenure governorship elections in Bayelsa, Edo, Kogi and Ondo States.\n\nAccording to him, the commission must reconcile itself with the fact that elections have become an all-year round undertaking in Nigeria.\n\nIn addition to the by-elections, he said INEC successfully concluded stakeholder engagements on the expansion of voter access to polling units.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am glad to inform you that the option of converting existing voting points and voting point settlements into full-fledged polling units and situating them in the most agreeable locations to support increased voter access was overwhelmingly accepted by Nigerians. Consequently, the commission has, in the last three weeks, concluded the actual exercise as well as the verification of the newly established polling units.\n\n\u201cIn the next few days, the commission will meet to finalise the compilation and coding of polling units and thereafter make the information public.\n\n\u201cAs you are also aware, our current strategic plan covering the period 2016-2021 expires at the end of this year. Consequently, the committee set up by the commission to develop the 2022-2026 strategic plan has concluded its work, the validation of which will commence this week.\n\nHe also said that INEC had completed preparations for the resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) commencing on June 28.\n\nYakubu stated that preparations for the Anambra State governorship election, to be held on November 6, and the FCT Area Council election scheduled for February 12, 2022, will be prioritised.\n\nSimilarly, he said INEC would continue the early preparations for 2023 general election.\n\nAccording to him, the commission has already established an Election Project Plan (EPP) Committee to work on the 2023 election plan, with the aim of completing the plan early enough and ensuring that INEC is fully ready for the election.\n\nHoodlums Set Ablaze Two INEC Offices Burnt\n\nMeanwhile, two offices of the commission in Ebonyi State have been set ablaze by hoodlums.\n\nThe two INEC offices are located at Ezza North and Ebonyi Local Government Areas of State.\n\nIt was gathered that the hoodlums invaded the two separate offices in the early hours of yesterday and set them ablaze, resulting in the destruction of sensitive and non-sensitive documents.\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, who confirmed the incidents, said some of the security challenges in the state were politically motivated.\n\nUmahi stated this when the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 9, Umuahia, Abia State, Mr Etim Ene Okon, visited the state to address the ongoing insecurity in the state.\n\nEtim decried the insecurity, especially kidnapping, cultism, banditry among others.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part of the insecurity is the incessant killing of police officers, burning of their stations and making away with their arms and ammunition\n\n\u201cStakeholders should call those responsible for the hideous crime to order because they are from your different communities of the state,\u201d Etim said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Assures foreign investors of stable fiscal policies\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged European nations and international financial institutions to grant debt relief to African countries.\n\nHe also gave an assurance that Public-Private Partnership (PPP) will be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\nIn addition, Buhari urged investors to further explore vast opportunities of human and natural resources in Nigeria, while assuring them that fiscal policies will be more favourable, predictable and measurably tilted towards creating a harmonious business environment.\n\nThe president, in his presentation at the Financing Africa Summit, held in Paris, with the theme: \u201cExternal Financing and Debt Treatment,\u201d called on European countries and global financial institutions to consider reducing the devastating effect of the Coronavirus pandemic on the African economies.\n\nThis, he said, could be done by restructuring debt portfolios, opting for complete relief, and releasing vaccines to the continent, which is still behind in protecting majority of its citizens.\n\nAccording to him, fall in commodity prices as COVID-19 took a toll on the global economy has further slowed growth in some countries and strained health facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in this vein that we solicit the support of the French government with its influence in the European Union to lend its voice to the efforts being made to mobilise additional resources for developing economies, most especially Africa in order to strengthen the quantum of investments to our economies. This financial support should also be extended to the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe president said the European Union should encourage fair and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in less developed countries, and promote the establishment of manufacturing facilities.\n\nBuhari stated that many African countries are already experiencing debt distress and the Debt Service Suspension by France and G-20 does not go far enough.\n\nHe added that there was need for more sustainable and affordable financing solutions, including debt relief and further debt restructuring.\n\nOn the Paris Agreement for Climate Change, the president stated that African countries would need financial support for green energy investment and COP-26, adding that Nigeria will refocus on gas while adopting a Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative.\n\nBuhari, while also speaking on the theme of \u201cAfrica Private Sector \u2014 Reforms \u2013 Infrastructure\u2019\u2019 said Public-Private Partnership (PPP) would be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe government intends to leverage on Public-Private Partnership to bolster its job creation, and anti-corruption drive. In terms of job creation, Nigeria has an abundant labour force since 30.5 per cent of its population is between the ages of 25 and 54.\u201d\n\nBuhari, at another occasion in Paris, urged investors to further explore vast opportunities of human and natural resources in Nigeria, while assuring them that fiscal policies will be more favourable, predictable and measurably tilted towards creating a harmonious business environment.\n\nThe president spoke when he hosted Chairman of Total, Patrick Pouyanne; Executive Vice President, AirBus, Silvere Delaunay; Chairman of the Board of a software company, Daussault Systems, Florence Verzelen; Chairman/CEO of General Engineering and Marketing of Telecommunications Operator, Francois-Regis Teze and Chairman/CEO, Donaflex Automotive, Dr. Donatus Nwokoye.\n\nAt the meeting with the delegation from Total, Buhari said the outlook and potential for growth in the country remained steadily positive and affirmed the government\u2019s commitment to scale up operating standards and policies that encourage mutual benefits.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe are very pleased with the evolving trends in technology, which is currently driving development across the world and Nigeria. Nigeria is more a gas country than a crude oil-producing country. In the 80\u2019s we generated more from gas, than crude oil. In the \u201980s, we were earning more from gas for some years and had put in place structures. We intend to further explore the gas sector. I am pleased with your consistency in staying in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe urged investors to take advantage of the natural and human resources in Nigeria, saying that the demographics favour development, with more young people who are eager to be gainfully engaged and trained.\n\nThe president thanked Pouyanne for the company\u2019s consistency and expansion in Nigeria since 1956, assuring him that the government will enhance fiscal stability to favour investors.\n\n\u201dWe need to educate the youth and encourage more skills in technology. Technology has been most impactful in all sectors, including the oil and gas, which has witnessed a rapid transformation in exploration, processing and distribution,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, said Total had confirmed long-term investments in Nigeria and had consistently exceeded targets in gas production.\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has designed solutions to some of the challenges in the oil and gas sector, particularly on tax.\n\nPouyanne told the president of the readiness of the company to stay in Nigeria, and to further expand interest in oil, gas, solar and other commodities that will directly impact the lives of citizens.\n\nHe said investors had been eagerly waiting for the passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as it would send a strong signal of more predictability.\n\n\u201cTotal is very committed to Nigeria. We have no intention of leaving Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari also yesterday met with the President of Ethiopia, Sahle-Work Zewde, who came to brief him on the regional security and political situation in the Horn of Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

All the documents ranging from the invitation letters and our client\u2019s reply with the documentary proofs will be found if demanded.\n\n\u201cSir, it is instructive to ask why the witch-hunt? Why the hurry to declare our client wanted? Why the publication without properly inviting our client in accordance with the law? What actually is the aim behind these investigations having been investigated by the DSS and EFCC on the same subject matter?\u201d\n\nKumo said he is ready to approach the ICPC the moment he is properly served with an invitation.\n\nSaharaReporters had on May 14 reported that a statement signed by Ogugua, ICPC Spokesperson, urged the public to provide information about the whereabouts of Kumo and his cohort.\n\nThe statement had read, \"The persons whose pictures appear above, Mr. Tarry Rufus, Mr. Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr. Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of Sixty-five million dollars ($65,000,000),\" the commission said.\n\n\"Anyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters Abuja, any of the ICPC State Offices or the nearest police station.\"\n\nDocuments: Gimba Yau vs. Ic... by Sahara Reporters",

The record stood for about 20 years before it was broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvans was, however, the cynosure of all eyes during the 1968 Olympic Games after he had earlier considered boycotting the tournament alongside Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two other US sprinters, to protest against the racial injustice in America at that time.\n\nThe three sprinters were nicknamed \u201cSpeed City\u201d for their collegiate dominance and were all active in the black power movement.\n\nThe trio would later compete in the Olympics, where Smith and Carlos also won gold and bronze, respectively, in the 200-meter dash and raised their fist on the podium for the iconic black panther salute.\n\nWhile accepting his gold medals, the double Olympic champion wore a black beret and gave a black power salute on the podium alongside Larry James and Ron Freeman \u2014 fellow black teammates and medalists \u2014 imitating members of the Black Panther Party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith and Carlos also raised their fists on the medals stand and did the same salute after the 200 meters in the same Olympics. The development had led to their eviction from the US Olympic team in Mexico amid a wave of opprobrium.\n\nEvans was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1983.\n\nAt the end of his career, Evans, who was a leading member of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, an organisation \u2014 founded in 1967 \u2014 that spoke against racial inequality and oppression in the United States and across the world, came to Africa, where he worked for the United Nations, and also coached national teams in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe was also an assistant track coach at Odegbami\u2019s International College and Sports Academy which is situated along Lagos-Abeokuta expressway.",

          "title": "Nigerians mourn a painful dip day for crypto, but the rallying cry is \u201cHODL!\u201d",
          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAs our interview drew to a close I asked her what dreams and goals she had. \u201cEssentially, I just want to be happy\u2026\u201d This was how she began her answer.\n\nThe other part of her answer that stuck with me was her plan to sell natural hair wigs to \u201cblack women everywhere.\u201d\n\nWith her business Natural Girl Wigs, she now ships to black women in over 65 countries.\n\nWe talk about growing up in Lagos and falling in love with her hair. Her story takes us from building a community on social media to later growing a successful tech-enabled business with that same community.\n\nHer name is Oluremi Martins-Areola and this is her life in tech.\n\nIt\u2019s all about hair. Black hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a very interesting view of my hair.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerian millennials remember where they were when Agbani Darego won the Miss World Pageant in 2001. I remember a lot of rejoicing on my street when the announcer said \u201cMiss Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFor Oluremi, the pageant was one thing to be excited about but Darego\u2019s iconic hairdo would be the thing with the lasting influence.\n\n\u201cMy father would indulge me during the weekends and take me to go do the Agbani Darego style,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Monday she had to return to whatever hairstyle her secondary school had assigned. But for those weekends, Oluremi\u2019s hair could do whatever she wanted it to.\n\nShe went on to study history and diplomatic studies at the University of Lagos but for her, deciding on what to study was not something she had bothered about too much.\n\n\u201cIt was actually never about what I was going to study. I always knew that school would be a stepping stone to whatever I wanted to achieve. I felt I was going to go into some type of media or doing a business that had an impact so I felt like it was okay to do anything in school.\u201d\n\nWhile at the university, she became active on social media and started learning about digital marketing through online courses. This would help her land a job as a social media manager for a consulting firm right out of school.\n\nShe changed jobs a few times before finally working at Image Boosters, a digital agency where she would begin to form the idea for her business.\n\n\u201cIt was a personal awakening for me because I had this beautiful natural hair and anytime I wanted to buy wigs or protective styles it was always these European or Indian weaves.\u201d\n\nOluremi\u2019s business started with an Instagram page where she built a community of black women who wanted to care for their hair but also get access to wigs made just for them.\n\n\u201cI thought, why shouldn\u2019t I have wigs that look like my natural hair\u2026\u201d\n\nShe soon began selling wigs sometime in 2018 and eventually left her job after six months of running the Instagram account.\n\nLooking back on her decision to leave paid employment and face her business full time, Oluremi tells me it was tough. She had just gotten a promotion that came with more money and deciding to leave at that time felt scary.\n\nBut by the end of her first year, she had made revenue of up to six figures in dollars \u2013 and she hadn\u2019t even set up her website yet. Her dream of reaching black women around the world was slowly starting to take shape.\n\nBuilding Natural Girl Wigs\n\nBefore the pandemic, Oluremi already ran a remote workforce. Save for the actual making of the wigs, there was no need for her staff to be physically present for anything. She counts this as one of the reasons the pandemic didn\u2019t disrupt her business too much.\n\nNatural Girl Wigs is currently in its third year. After making impressive sales in the first year, it became important for the company to have its own solutions available on a website and not just a social media account.\n\nThe business now caters to black hair in different ways. Of its features, The Hair Quiz stands out. With the quiz, customers are able to answer questions about their hair and are provided with recommendations on hair care and products.\n\nThe website also provides hair tutorials and content tailored to black hair.\n\nOne of the toughest parts of running an e-commerce business anywhere in the world today has to be logistics. To ease the strain of shipping to one of her biggest markets \u2013 the U.S. \u2013 Oluremi had to start manufacturing the wigs in the U.S. as well.\n\n\u201cLogistics is a serious challenge we\u2019ve faced. We currently work with a third party entity that handles delivery for us.\u201d\n\nWith Natural Girl Wigs now delivering to countries all over the world, Oluremi points out how a community was key to growing.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the initial Instagram page was just me posting things around beauty and lifestyle to a great community of people that would be interested in the product I was going to launch.\u201d\n\nThe community has continued to grow and Natural Girl Wigs currently has close to 60,000 email subscribers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nFor Oluremi, the future for Natural Girl Wigs involves scaling manufacturing. A lot of the materials being used are currently being imported from China and other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen I was doing my research, I realised that most of the manufacturers of hair are Chinese or Asian and a future I would like to explore is one where I have a factory where we make hair from scratch in Africa.\u201d\n\nAway from work, there are a few things Oluremi enjoys: hanging out with her husband, going to restaurants, attending events in Lagos. She hopes to continue to do these things that make her happy.\n\nShe would also like to help people realise the paths to their own goals and dreams.\n\nWhether through her Instagram videos on growing your business or any other medium she may use soon, Oluremi is keen on letting people know that it\u2019s never too late to go for the things they want because as she puts it, \u201cwhenever you wake up is your morning.\u201d",

          "text": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025. It is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\n\nBut there has been some recent progress. A tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%. Analysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\n\nWhatever the correct figure is, Nigeria still has some ways to go due to a mix of challenges, one of which is infrastructure and an inability to standardise fees. For broadband access to increase throughout the country, network operators have to dig up roads and lay optic fibre cables.\n\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments. But RoW fees are high and it is expensive to lay cables; so broadband connectivity suffers.\n\nWhile RoW is a source of revenue for state governments, the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract telcos to make a significant broadband investment. In 2020, MTN requested approval from the Ekiti state government to lay 160km of fibre optic cables after reducing its RoW fees.\n\nGovernors agree to slash Right of Way fees\n\nStandardising RoW fees is one way to encourage telcos to make investments in broadband infrastructure, so in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s 36 governors agreed to an important step \u2013 a standardised RoW fee of \u20a6145/m.\n\nSo far, only Kaduna, Ekiti, Katsina, Plateau, Ekiti, Kwara, Anambra, and Imo are implementing the new fees one year after the agreement. States like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge N2,500, N4,000, N750 per Linear Meter.\n\nIt is unclear why these states are not implementing the new fees, but stakeholders continue to mount pressure regardless. There are reports that the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) is looking at signing a Memorandum of Understanding with states to bring down RoW charges.\n\nThere have also been discussions on the floor of the National Assembly, but it has not translated into lower fees mostly because the governors reserve the right to fix these fees.\n\nRegardless of this power, the governors of the remaining 29 states must play the long game and lower prices because deepening broadband penetration is a big win for Nigeria as a whole.",
          "summary": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025.\nIt is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\nA tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%.\nAnalysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Google has announced new features and looks coming to the Google ecosystem in its annual Google I/O event. Held virtually on YouTube on Tuesday, May 18, 2021, some of the most exciting announcements were Android 12, changes in Google Workspace, and a new artificial intelligence.\n\nGoogle I/O (aka I/O) is Google\u2019s annual developer conference. In this year\u2019s edition, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, said the event \u201chas always been a celebration of technology and its ability to improve lives.\u201d\n\nAndroid phones will now have a new privacy feature that lets them see which apps are using their device\u2019s sensors, such as cameras and mics. The privacy dashboard will allow users to revoke access to apps they don\u2019t trust.\n\nIt appears tech giants are making efforts to ensure users feel safe using their devices. On April 23, 2021, Apple announced a new update to iOS 14.5. According to Verge, the biggest feature of the software update is the app tracking feature that notifies users of apps tracking their usage across other apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsides from that, Google revealed Smart Canvas, a new addition to its Workspace tools, to improve digital working experience. This addition is to help workers collaborate effectively within a digital workspace. With Smart Canvas, teams can create a brainstorm table. It also provides results based on an analysis of each member\u2019s contribution.\n\nGoogle will also incorporate a dedicated Google Meet button into Google Docs, Sheets, and every other Workspace tool. This will enable teams to hear and see each other while collaborating on a project.\n\nWhile Google is helping teams work closely together with its digital workspace features, it is also creating real-time 3D models of people to bring them closer to their loved ones.\n\nDubbed Project Starline, Google claims this new technology project will help friends, families, and co-workers have a semblance of closeness though they\u2019re miles apart. Google will use high-definition cameras and other advanced software and hardware to create a 3D model of a person moving and communicating in real-time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s push for realism is perhaps why it has also announced Language Model for Dialogue Application (LaMDA). Described by Pichai as Google\u2019s latest breakthrough in natural language understanding, Google claims LaMDA will carry on a conversation no matter what it is being discussed.\n\nInterestingly, LaMDA will not be trained on text alone. The language model will be able to understand conversations based on images, audio, and video.\n\nThe LaMDA demo during I/O displays far more intelligence than Google\u2019s AI assistant. Users might now be able to have realistic conversations with their mobile phones.\n\nUnveiling Android 12 with exciting visuals and animations, Google is bringing more personalisation options to the Android experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the beta version of the new OS is out, it is only available to a select number of Android phones.\n\nThis year\u2019s Google I/O comes with a lot of exciting new features and technologies. And while Google\u2019s presentation might be dazzling, only users can determine the effectiveness of these features.\n\nFeatured image credits: Dylan Carr on Unsplash\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

In this year\u2019s edition, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, said the event \u201chas always been a celebration of technology and its ability to improve lives.\u201d\n\nAndroid phones will now have a new privacy feature that lets them see which apps are using their device\u2019s sensors, such as cameras and mics. The privacy dashboard will allow users to revoke access to apps they don\u2019t trust.\n\nIt appears tech giants are making efforts to ensure users feel safe using their devices. On April 23, 2021, Apple announced a new update to iOS 14.5. According to Verge, the biggest feature of the software update is the app tracking feature that notifies users of apps tracking their usage across other apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsides from that, Google revealed Smart Canvas, a new addition to its Workspace tools, to improve digital working experience. This addition is to help workers collaborate effectively within a digital workspace. With Smart Canvas, teams can create a brainstorm table. It also provides results based on an analysis of each member\u2019s contribution.\n\nGoogle will also incorporate a dedicated Google Meet button into Google Docs, Sheets, and every other Workspace tool. This will enable teams to hear and see each other while collaborating on a project.\n\nWhile Google is helping teams work closely together with its digital workspace features, it is also creating real-time 3D models of people to bring them closer to their loved ones.\n\nDubbed Project Starline, Google claims this new technology project will help friends, families, and co-workers have a semblance of closeness though they\u2019re miles apart. Google will use high-definition cameras and other advanced software and hardware to create a 3D model of a person moving and communicating in real-time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s push for realism is perhaps why it has also announced Language Model for Dialogue Application (LaMDA). Described by Pichai as Google\u2019s latest breakthrough in natural language understanding, Google claims LaMDA will carry on a conversation no matter what it is being discussed.\n\nInterestingly, LaMDA will not be trained on text alone. The language model will be able to understand conversations based on images, audio, and video.\n\nThe LaMDA demo during I/O displays far more intelligence than Google\u2019s AI assistant. Users might now be able to have realistic conversations with their mobile phones.\n\nUnveiling Android 12 with exciting visuals and animations, Google is bringing more personalisation options to the Android experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the beta version of the new OS is out, it is only available to a select number of Android phones.\n\nThis year\u2019s Google I/O comes with a lot of exciting new features and technologies. And while Google\u2019s presentation might be dazzling, only users can determine the effectiveness of these features.\n\nFeatured image credits: Dylan Carr on Unsplash\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "In a recent development, Ghanaians will have to re-register their SIM cards with Ghana Card, the country\u2019s smart national ID.\n\nVice President Mahamudu Bawumia announced this at the fifth edition of the CEO Summit, a two-day event held in Accra on Monday, May 17 and Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nA tweet released by Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Communications stated that the re-registration process commences in June and runs till December, after which all unregistered SIMs will be blocked.\n\nAll SIM cards and SIM enabled devices would be re-registered from next month and end in December.

Ghana\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digitalisation, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, believes this is a huge step in curtailing these activities and creating a structure for accountability in the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nGhana\u2019s latest plans can be likened to what\u2019s happening in Nigeria currently, with mobile subscribers having to link their SIM cards to their National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nRecall that this led to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) suspending SIM card sales and registration for four months and intensifying NIN registration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent statistics show that some progress was made in this period, with over 51 million subscribers registered in four months.\n\nHowever, there were downsides as telcos steadily lost subscribers and revenue. A recent Techpoint Africa article suggested that forcing people to go out to get their NIN might have caused a spike in the country\u2019s COVID-19 cases.\n\nOne can only hope that the process is less tedious in Ghana, with the NIA looking to open more offices across the country before June. So far, over 15.5 million Ghanaians have gotten the Ghana Card.\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode! Listen to Built in Africa\n\nComments",

Disruptions in the supply might elongate the interval required between the administration of first and second doses of AstraZeneca and affect efficacy.\n\nExcept for states such as Lagos, where second vaccine doses have been earmarked from initial allocation, many states that have exhausted their consignments are likely to be stranded.\n\n\u201cSII has delivered more than 200 million doses,\u201d the Serum Institute said Tuesday in a statement posted to its Twitter account.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAs a serving Corper with the Nigerian Observer Newspaper, I walk pass the magnificent Oba of Benin\u2019s palace on my way to work from the popular Ring Road Junction. Each time I sight the palace, I would have a reverberant curiosity of how the palace looks like on the inside. I imagined that the palace most hold a lot for my curious mind.\n\nAlas, dreams come through and I was at the Oba\u2019s palace last week for the Ugie Ododua Festival with my other senior colleague reporters. It was exciting to be where I had longed to be. Enquired what the festival is about and an elderly man in the audience replied that it was a ceremony for the purification and sanctification of the land, to ward off evil and appease the gods for bountifulness in the land.\n\nTo say that Benin Kingdom was and is still rich in cultural heritage is almost cliche. The vividity of the cultural cosmology of the Benin people is not only in the history books that we read but also the oral traditions and customs of the people give credence to their cultural aesthetics. A trip to Benin city will leave you with out a doubt of its cultural renaissance.\n\nA few meter away from the Oba\u2019s palace is the Benin National Museum which houses some of the finest arts and crafts of the Benin people. It serves as a tourist attraction to visitors seeking to know more about the ancient great Benin Empire.\n\nThe Ugie Ododua festival usually takes a period of fourteen days. The first seven days are observed as indoor activities while the later seven days are observed as public performances, the one we attended being the grand finale with dignitaries far and near in attendance. While the palace was crowdy, the atmosphere was solemn. As a cultural enthusiast nothing could be more gratifying than to witness the epic festival.\n\nDuring the festival, seven Ododua masquerades dressed in red regalia come out in a single file from Ugha-Erhoba accompanied by members of the Iwebo Palace Society, chiefs Osague, Osa and Osuan of Benin Kingdom. Each of these seven masquerades represent a deity in the kingdom.\n\nWith unique drum beats, dance steps and incantations, each masquerade marched to the throne of the Oba ( King) to offer supplication and pay homage. The Benin people see the Oba as both political and spiritual head of the kingdom.\n\nThere were also the Ononges ( the dukes of the kingdom) and the members of the royal family who were all dressed in white paraphernalia. They all made obeisance to His Royal Majesty. I indeed feasted my eyes on the legendary display of culture.\n\nSpeaking of the historical background of Ugie Ododua festival, the Benin people trace the origin to Oba Eweka1 who used the festival to commomerate the successful return of Oramiyan the son of Ododua to his ancestral home, the Benin kingdom which also marked the return of of Obaship era after a period of interregnum.\n\n\u201cToday, the festival is celebrated at the instance of OmoN\u2019ObaN\u2019Edo, Aku Akpolokpolo to offer prayers to Ancestors for blessings and protection of Oba, members of the Royal family, chiefs and the entire people of the kingdom and beyond.\u201d Remarked a titled chief.\n\nBut the sanctity of Benin Kingdom had suffered a setback in 1897 when the British colonial forces razed Benin City, massacring an unknown number of people and bringing a violent recess to the advancing civilization to the Kingdom of Benin, which had thrived for centuries as one of West Africa\u2019s major powers. The invasion was to avenge the killing of an earlier force by the soldiers of the Oba.\n\nThere are records that during the raid, British troops looted at least 3,000 precious artifacts made by the Edo people, including ivory statues, carved elephant tusks, ceramics, masks, carved portraits of Obas (or kings) and their mothers, and more than 1,000 intricately decorated brass plaques that once adorned ancestral altars and court buildings in the city\u2019s royal palace.\n\nIn the wake of last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests that re-echoed around the globe of injustices against the black people around the world, there is an invigorating call for the restitution of looted treasures from the African continent by the Western countries during the dark years of incursion and colonialism. Many museums and organizations across the Europe where these looted artifacts especially the Benin Bronzes are kept have heeded the call.\n\nAs reported by BBC in April, the German Culture Minister, Monika Gruetters has disclosed that \u201cthe first return of the looted treasures were expected to take place in 2022\u201d.\n\nThe tragic retaliatory invasion of Benin Kingdom by the British government seemed to be the end of the once ebullient kingdom but we know that the history of mankind is replete with rise and fall or fall and rise as the case maybe. Benin rose again and about a century and half later, the sanctity of the people\u2019s culture is still upheld with a stylish dignity.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

Therefore, we can no longer afford to ignore actions against greenhouse effects.\n\n\u201cIt is to this end that these sets of standards and the other approved standards in this category are considered very important, timely and instruments for actions to support energy sufficiency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director general said that the standards would also mitigate the negative effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cAs these standards are launched today, opportunities for fair trade practices, lowered cost of manufacture/assembly, consumer satisfaction, business expansion, employment creation and career development will all be enhanced.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to comply with all the requirements of these standards to ensure good manufacturing practices and the best product quality that will satisfy all consumers at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nSalim explained that the SON would carry out stakeholders awareness campaign and strict enforcement to ensure that manufacturers, project developers and users complied with the new standards.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that representatives of relevant government agencies, international partners and other stakeholders in the power sector were present at the launch.\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission(NERC), Federal Ministry of Power, the Nigerian National Committee of IEC/Technical Committee were among the relevant institutions that sent their goodwill messages to SON.\n\nEngr. Peter Ewesor, NEMSA Managing Director and Chief Electrical Inspector of the Federation, said that the launch was a milestone in the effort toward enforcement of standards and regulations.\n\nHe said that NEMSA enforcement team would work with SON to ensure that manufacturers of electrical materials and installations upheld stipulated standards.\n\n...",

          "title": "El-Rufai talks tough, blasts FG, gives condition for negotiation with NLC",
          "text": "Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has vowed that his administration would not honour a meeting with the Nigeria Labour Congress unless electricity is restored in his state.\n\nThe governor also lambasted the federal government for allowing workers of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) owned by it to disrupt electricity supply to his state.\n\nMr El-Rufai made the comment after the NLC announced a suspension of a five-day warning strike called to protest the Kaduna government\u2019s plans to lay off some of its civil servants due to what it blamed on a severe fiscal crisis.\n\nThe NLC suspended the industrial action after the intervention of the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, who requested parties to sheathe swords for a federal government-mediated negotiation to hold in Abuja.\n\nBut shortly after the NLC announced it was suspending the strike to enable it to honour the planned Abuja meeting, a defiant Mr El-Rufai issued a statement that said no official of his government would negotiate with the unions unless electricity is restored in the state.\n\nThe National Union of Electricity Employees is an affiliate of the NLC and its members had on Sunday switched off electricity supply in the state and joined the strike.\n\nIn his statement early Thursday morning, Mr El-Rufai said, \u201cNo official of Kaduna State will go to Abuja for any meeting with FGN (Federal Government of Nigeria) or NLC when the citizens of the State have no electricity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold the FGN responsible for (its) inability to assert its ownership rights over TCN (Transmission Company of Nigeria). No electricity, no meeting.\u201d\n\nHours before his latest update, the state government had said it was yet to see evidence \u201cthat the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the State.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric power is yet to be restored after it was shut down at dawn on Sunday, 16th May 2021, in brazen violation of the laws protecting essential services and infrastructure,\u201d Muyiwa Adekeye, the spokesperson to Mr El-Rufai, had said in a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES at 9:21 pm on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat action removed any basis for state government officials to meet the NLC last Sunday. Denying our people electricity about 18 hours to the advertised commencement of their organised sabotage was akin to putting a gun on the government\u2019s head. Government has a lawful duty not to indulge blackmail.\n\n\u201cRestoring electricity is vital to relieving some of the pain that needless acts of lawlessness have inflicted on our people.\n\n\u201cThe unimpeded provision of essential services is vital to civilised order. Those who have disrupted it should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation, much less being viewed as a precondition.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not participate in such a negotiation or countenance one whilst our people are still being denied their right to electricity.\u201d\n\nMr Ngige had on Wednesday afternoon announced that he had apprehended the strike and invited parties to an emergency conciliation meeting at his office in the nation\u2019s capital by 11 am on Thursday.\n\nThe minister further directed the two parties to maintain the status quo ante bellum pending the resolution of the issues in contention.\n\nThe letter Mr Ngige separately addressed to both Governor El-Rufai and the president of the NLC reads in part:\n\n\u201c Sequel to the strike prompted by the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) one of the federations of Trade Unions in Nigeria, and the subsequent withdrawal of work and services in almost all public sector establishments and institutions in Kaduna State, including but not limited to the essential services in electricity, water and health, which has consequently resulted and inflicted huge damage and loss to the economy and well-being and even loss of lives to the people of Kaduna State in the last three days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201c I am therefore constrained in the exercise of my powers as the Minister of Labour and Employment, under the Trade Disputes Act, CAP. T8, Laws of Federation of Nigeria (LFN) 2004; to invite you and your top officials to the emergency trade dispute conciliation meeting.\u201d\n\nThe letter said \u201cbetween the transition period for the meeting, you are please requested to maintain the status quo ante bellum before this dispute so that the enabling climate for the resolution of the issues in dispute will not be hindered by the creation of new issues.\u201d\n\nUnder the Trade Disputes Act, which is the principal law dealing with the settlement of industrial disputes in Nigeria, the Minister of Labour has powers to intervene in a trade dispute for the purpose of settling it.",

          "text": "Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc hosted the number one citizen, His Excellency, Muhammdu Buhari, GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria at the launch of its campaign, The Stock Africa Is Made Of.\n\nThe virtual event which took place on Tuesday, 18 May 2021 was held to amplify NGX Group\u2019s positioning and commitment to the African financial markets as a leading capital market infrastructure provider, connecting Nigeria, Africa and the world, as well as spotlight the growth potential of the African continent.\n\nIn delivering his remarks prior to sounding the closing gong and bringing the day\u2019s trading to a close, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR stated, \u201cIt is my pleasure to join you all at this important event organised to amplify the positive narrative about Africa and its great potentials. Let me start by congratulating Nigerian Exchange Group Plc on its recently concluded demutualisation, which is the first in the country. I recall signing the Demutualisation Bill in August 2018, paving the way for the long awaited demutualisation of the then Nigerian Stock Exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also important for me to highlight that the history of NGX Group is tied to that of the Nation itself founded 61 years ago at a pivotal time when Nigeria gained her independence. The Exchange continues to play its part in nation building by stimulating economic growth and providing a platform for businesses and individual to save and raise capital through innovation, diversified products and services, enabling regulatory environment and much more. The occasion of the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange is yet a proud moment for all of us, and indeed all Nigerians deserve congratulations for this feat as it is the beginning of a new era for the capital market,\u201d President Buhari added.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Group Chairman, NGX Group Plc, Otunba Abimbola Ogunbanjo stated, \u201cThe Exchange has come a long way, through different leadership regimes \u2013 civilian and military \u2013 that have overseen multiple boom and bust economic dispensations within the Nigerian economy, to emerge as a leading integrated market infrastructure in Africa and the engine of growth for Africa\u2019s largest economy. Our story is one birthed from resilience, collaboration, determination and continued focus on our vision. A true Africa story. With demutualisation, NGX Group is well positioned to enable strong economic growth and contribute its quota to the development of the Nigerian capital market, and the African Continent.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON noted that, \u201cAt Nigerian Exchange Group Plc, we have a vision to be the premier Exchange hub for Nigerian businesses and for the wider African economy building on the strong reputation and corporate governance the NSE has established over the years. As we march bravely into the NGX era, we look forward to impact creating partnerships that will unlock value for our stakeholders, whilst improving the state of the Nigerian economy. It is a period to reinforce on the global stage, our great African pedigree and the Stock Africa Is Made of.\u201d\n\nThe unveiling event culminated in a Closing Gong Ceremony where the CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited, Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA, stated, \u201cI am delighted to have hosted His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our special guest of honour. Today\u2019s epochal Closing Gong Ceremony could not have been possible without Mr President\u2019s support. The NGX era is indeed very exciting for us and we will continue to champion the growth of the African capital market through trade and investments that will facilitate Africa\u2019s economic recovery and reposition the continent for sustainable economic development. Partnerships are a critical element of our strategy and we will continue to engage our stakeholders whose support is essential to the achievement of our aspirations in this NGX era.\u201d\n\nIn her closing remarks, the CEO, NGX Regulation Limited, Ms. Tinuade Awe stated, \u201cMy deepest gratitude goes to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, for gracing us with his presence and honouring our invitation to close the market on the official launch day of the NGX era. This has truly been an inspiring event and we have our amazing line-up of speakers to thank for that. I must also thank our regulators, the entire capital market ecosystem and the Management and staff of Nigerian Exchange Group for the hard work and diligence that has set us firmly on the path of success. It has been an exciting journey to date, and I am confident that we will all work well together to achieve even greater heights in the NGX era.\u201d\n\nThe event featured several key speeches and goodwill messages from industry veterans across the public and private sectors including Dr. Zainab Ahmed, Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Federal Republic of Nigeria; Otunba Richard Adeniyi Adebayo, CON, Honourable Minister of Trade and Investment, Federal Republic of Nigeria; Mr. Lamido Yuguda, Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Alhaji Aliko Dangote, GCON, Chairman, Dangote Group; Mr. Jim Ovia, CON, Chairman, Zenith Bank Plc; Mr. Masai Ujiri, President, Toronto Raptors; Mr. Tony Elumelu, CON, Group Chairman, United Bank for Africa (UBA) & Founder, The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF); Mr. David Swchimmer, CEO, London Stock Exchange; Ms. Julie Becker, CEO, Luxembourg Stock Exchange; Mr. Eric Hespenheide, Board Chairman, Global Reporting Initiative; and Mr. Ben Llewellyn-Jones, Deputy British High Commission Lagos.\n\nAward-winning singer, songwriter and producer Innocent \u20182Baba\u2019 Idibia alongside the \u2018boo of the booless\u2019, Chike, provided first-class entertainment at the virtual event which was moderated by veteran Master of Ceremonies, Ik Osakioduwa.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate on Wednesday considered a bill that seeks to prohibit the payment and receipt of ransom for the release of any person kidnapped, imprisoned or wrongfully confined.\n\nThe Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which scaled second reading during plenary is sponsored by Senator Ezenwa Francis Onyewuchi (Imo East).\n\nLeading debate on the bill, the lawmaker said the piece of legislation seeks to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013 to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers and terrorists for the release of any person who has been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to Onyewuchi, the bill essentially seeks to substitute for section 14 of the Principal Act a new section to read: \u201cAnyone who transfers funds, makes payment or colludes with an abductor, kidnapper or terrorist to receive any ransom for the release of any person who has been wrongfully confined, imprisoned or kidnapped is guilty of a felony and is liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment of not less than 15 years.\u201d\n\nHe raised alarm that Kidnapping has become a fast and lucrative business, adding that, \u201cit has now remained the most virulent form of banditry in Nigeria and the most pervasive and intractable violent crime in the country.\u201d\n\nAttributing the spate of kidnappings in the country to factors such as corruption, unemployment, poverty and connivance of security agents, Onyewuchi lamented that the frequency at which persons are kidnapped daily puts most Nigerians at risk.\n\n\u201cKidnapping is on the increase in Nigeria and it is prevalent across all the geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cSome blame the rise of this criminal activity on poverty, religion, politics, deficiency of existing laws, unemployment, connivance of security agents, corruption, and greed among others.\n\n\u201cOur unemployed youths are also turning out to kidnapping to get money (ransom) as a survival strategy.\n\n\u201cWhatever the reason, it is most obvious that kidnapping in Nigeria puts everyone at risk, the rich and the poor, old and young, male and female, foreigner or indigene, expatriate or non-expatriate, traditional rulers and religious leaders, among others\u201d he said.\n\nCiting a report compiled by the Financial Times and the USA Global Risk Consultancy in November, 2019, the lawmaker noted that Nigeria has the highest rate of kidnaps for ransom of both locals and foreigners in all of Africa with kidnappers operating in each of its 36 states.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe reason behind payments of ransom is rooted on the fact that people easily identify with individual suffering.\n\n\u201cHowever, History has shown that even where ransom is proven to have been paid, the life or safe return of a kidnap victim may not be guaranteed.\u201d\n\nHe observed that countries like the USA and the United Kingdom do not support payment of ransoms to kidnappers.\n\n\u201cPayments of terrorist ransoms is illegal under the UK Terrorism Act 2000 while the USA adheres to a strict No-Concessions policy on the payment of ransom\u201d, Onyewuchi pointed.\n\nHe advised that, \u201cthe continuous payment of ransom must not be encouraged, in addition government should provide adequate security and strengthen the economy as a matter of urgency, accelerate its poverty alleviation programs, provide employment opportunities targeting youths who are mostly involved in abductions and kidnappings, strengthen our law enforcement agencies, and provide the necessary support to end the menace of kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) Bill, 2021, after scaling second reading, was referred by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for further legislative work.\n\nThe Committee which is chaired by Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele is expected to report back in four weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, two separate bills seeking to establish the Federal University of Science and Technology, Lau, Taraba State, and to amend the Federal Universities of Technology Act 2004 also passed second reading on Wednesday.\n\nThe bills are sponsored by Senators Shuaibu Isa (Taraba North), and Oyelola Yisa Ashiru.\n\nBoth bills were referred by the Senate President to the Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND for further work.\n\nThe Committee was also given four weeks to turn in its report to the Senate.",

          "text": "Governor Nasir El-Rufai has vowed to make President of the Nigeria Labour Congress Ayuba Wabba and other labour leaders to be charged under a military era Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nThe decree, which came into effect on 31 December 1983 prescribes a 21 year-jail term or life sentence for anyone who shuts down public infrastructure, such as electricity supply.\n\nSection 9 of the law prescribes life jail for anyone who unlawfully disconnects, removes, damages, tampers, meddles with or in any way whatsoever interferes with any plant, works, cables, wire or assembly of wires designed or used for transforming or converting electricity.\n\nSection 10 prescribes a 21 year jail term for any person who unlawfully disconnects, removes, damages, tampers, meddles with or in any way whatsoever interferes with any electric fittings, meters or other appliances used for generating, transforming, converting, conveyancing, supplying or selling electricity.\n\nSince Kaduna was plunged into darkness for four days, El-Rufai had Section 10 of the Miscellaneous Act in mind when he spoke on Wednesday at the 23rd Annual Tax Conference organised by the The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN) in Kaduna on Wednesday.\n\nHe insisted the labour leaders are \u201ccriminals\u201d.\n\nHe said the actions of the labour union under the auspices of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), which prevented businesses like banks, petrol stations and others from opening is criminal, illegal and the government will deal with \u201cthe criminals\u201d.\n\nThe Governor pointed out that his government was not against the right of workers to embark on strike, but such workers must walk out of their work place and allow it to function without them.\n\nWhile he emphasised that workers or their unions do not have the right to stop any business or government establishment from opening, El-Rufai said those responsible for such were liable to be convicted on the Miscellaneous Offences Act, which attracts a minimum penalty of 21 years imprisonment.\n\nHe then apologised to the gathering on any inconvenience suffered due to the strike.\n\n\u201cAll those that have broken the law to the fullest extent will never come back to the state again by the time we are done with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are efforts to prevent legitimate business to open, there are efforts to prevent banks from opening and also preventing petrol stations from dispensing fuel, this is totally criminal and illegal and we are going to take action.\n\n\u201cWe are making efforts to provide security for all businesses that will wish to remain open.\n\n\u201cWe are not against the right to strike, you are free to strike, but walk away from your institution and allow it to function without you.\n\n\u201cYou have no right to stop any business from remaining open and we are going to take very strict measures against people that have tried to do that.\n\n\u201cWhat this strike is about is to answer fundamental questions, the first of which is this; should an employer, keep person of poor education, inadequate skills, qualifications and bad work attitude in employment, whether he likes it or not? Our answer in Kaduna state is in the negative.\n\n\u201cWe, as the employer, are in a contract of employment with the employee and if he is not up to scratch, we will let him go and that is included in our contact of service.\n\n\u201cThe second question is this, is the right to protest or to withdraw your services of an employee equivalent to the right to destroy the institution in which you work; shut it down or attack public infrastructure?\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, law is very clear, you can walk out, you can strike, but you cannot shut anything down.\n\n\u201cPublic infrastructure is a public asset belonging to the federation which belongs to all the people in Nigeria and you have no right to shut it down and if you do, you are liable to be convicted on either the Miscellaneous Offences Act which attracts a minimum penalty of 21 years imprisonment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that we will break the strike and deal with the criminals, prosecute all those that have broken the law to the fullest extent and I assure you that they will never come back to the state again by the time we are done with them.\u201d\n\n*",

But none gave any indication of readiness to do so.\n\nAs a result of this problem, Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes ordered Abidemi Rufai detained and taken to the Western District of Washington, where he committed the offence he has been charged with.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the defendant is being detained and will be transported to the Western District of Washington for future court proceedings,\u201d said a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Seattle.\n\nHe will now be taken to Tacoma in Washington state for his next court hearing.\n\nAbidemi was arrested Friday in New York as he prepared to fly to Nigeria,\n\nOn Tuesday, federal prosecutors, according to Seattle Times, had argued that Rufai presented \u201can extreme risk of flight\u201d and had requested that he be held in custody until his trial in federal court in Tacoma.\n\nRufai is charged with stealing more than $350,000 last year by filing fraudulent unemployment claims with the Washington state Employment Security Department (ESD) using the identities of more than 100 Washingtonians. It was the first \u201csignificant\u201d arrest in that fraud, federal officials said.\n\nRufai \u201cdenies any involvement in these transactions,\u201d Barrows, his lawyer, said on Tuesday.\n\nShortly after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Barrows said he was \u201cseeking alternative surety\u201d and intended to apply again for bail for Rufai.\n\nAlthough defendants sometimes return to court in the afternoon following a morning hearing and seek to reopen a detention case, a spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York said Wednesday that \u201cthere is no second bail hearing scheduled at this time.\u201d",

Results from a clinical trial involving people in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries shows that Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people of 18 years of age.\n\nShe said the phase III clinical trial involved over 44,000 people. Half received a single dose of the vaccine while half were given placebo (a dummy injection) and they did not know if they were bgiven Janssen COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\n\n\u201cThe trial found a 67% reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate in severity and lasted 1-2 days.\n\nIn line with the NAFDAC\u2019s Pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring plan for COVID-19 vaccines, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine will be closely monitored and subject to several activities that apply specifically to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe added that manufacturers are required to provide monthly safety reports in addition to the regular updates generated by NAFDAC activities.\n\nJanssen COVID-19 Vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and National Primary Health Care Development Agency will announce when the vaccine becomes available for use in Nigeria.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Those are areas, I am so optimistic we can collaborate on. We are looking to deploy air surveillance across the state in terms of using drones, we can also collaborate in this area, as we see security as an important part of our administration,\u201d Abiodun added.\n\nHe stated that his administration was awaiting the donation of about six ambulances before the end of the week, adding that his administration is also waiting patiently for the Czech government to deliver on its promise to donate ambulances to the state.\n\n\u201cWe are anxiously waiting for those ambulances you promised us. When we assumed office, there were only five ambulances in the state. Today, we have twenty ambulances. I think somebody else is donating about maybe five, six ambulances sometimes this week. So, we have about twenty-six. We aim to have about thirty-five to forty ambulances because we want to have one ambulance per state constituency and we have twenty-six of such constituencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to provide enough ambulances to make that operational. We are providing ambulances in the primary health care centers, tricycle ambulances for pregnant women in that neighbourhood, we are rehabilitating the centers so that they give our people the confidence. At the end of this month, we should have about hundred of those in places, which is about five per local government. We are hoping to do two hundred and thirty-six between now and end of next year.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that once we have our Primary Health Care Centers in place, we can launch our health care insurance programme as well,\u201d Abiodun submitted.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

In the same vein, the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory wanted approval of Peace Corps of Nigeria to establish its formation in all schools and colleges in their various states and I have the written approval to that effect.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the issue that we are duplicating responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Youth Development and the Federal Ministry of Education is completely out of place.\n\n\u201cI want to say Mr. Chairman that based on the dynamic nature of the society, the time has come for the Nigeria Peace Corps to be elevated from the level of volunteerism to that of government driven oprational template.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, in a remark before declaring the public hearing session open , said observations made by President Muhammadu Buhari in the earlier bill refused assent during the 8th National Assembly , have been taken care of , in preventing such re \u2013 occurrence .",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has given assurance that his administration is ready to begin the process of implementing full autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nHe noted that the Judiciary in the state had been accorded full autonomy in line with the law.\n\nOkowa made this known in Asaba when he received the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Marshal Umukoro, who came with other judges in the state\u2019s judiciary to the Government House to intimate the governor of his impending retirement.\n\nAccording to him, with the signing of Judiciary Autonomy law in January, 2021 and the setting up of the relevant committees by the Chief Judge, the state is ready to begin the process of implementing full autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nThe governor stated that the House of Assembly in the state had been enjoying autonomy since two years ago even when some states were yet to start the process till date.\n\n\u201cI have never been against it, and that\u2019s why we went ahead to push for the law. The House of Assembly has been operating their own autonomy since two years even before they started talking about it in this country.\n\n\u201cIt has worked; I have not found any reason to regret that action. So, I believe too that there is no reason why the judiciary cannot run its own autonomy.\n\n\u201cI do also believe that it does not stop the arms of government from relating with each other.\n\n\u201cThe budgets are made on a yearly basis and the only challenge is that many times we are unable to fund it in full. However, what will be released on a monthly basis will be subject to the returns that come from Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC),\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the commencement of the full process, the Chief Judge had been empowered to effect his own direct approvals without having to resort to the governor.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to do that because it reduces the number of files on my table. So, I want to announce the full autonomy of the judiciary with the setting up of the committees.\n\n\u201cI am not doing this for any gains. I believe that it\u2019s right and just; I believe too that it\u2019s in the best interest of governance in our nation and that\u2019s how we have also thought about it in the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cI want to generally advise that autonomy does not stop governance from progressing; in fact, it helps governance and I believe that it is something worth doing,\u2019\u2019 Okowa stated\n\nHe thanked judges in the state for their role in ensuring delivery of justice.\n\n\u201cSo my Lord, the Chief Judge, I want to congratulate you for setting up the committee.\n\n\u201cApart from the files that are expected to come to my office, I will advise that no further files should be sent because you are now expected to approve your files by yourself because that\u2019s the process of the autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe thank God that whatever that has a beginning has an end, and I am glad that you have worked so hard to improve on the judicial process in the state.\n\n\u201cI truly appreciate your service to the state and the relationship you kept with the executive arm of government and my family. It was God who made it possible for you to conduct my inauguration in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary in Delta has continued to walk tall and what I hear happening in other states, I never witnessed it here.\n\n\u201cI have never had cause to worry here and I must thank the Chief Judge and all his brother judges for their cooperation.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer and hope that God will continue to be with you in the course of your retirement,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, Justice Umukoro had said that he led the judges to visit the governor as part of the valedictory activities leading to his disengagement as a judicial officer and head of the judicial arm of government in Delta.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to Governor Okowa for his support to him since he became the helmsman of the judiciary in 2015.\n\n\u201cSince I came on board six years ago, you treated me as a brother and I am grateful for your support even during the death of my wife.\n\n\u201cAs Chief Judge of Delta, I can confidently say that we have never had any crisis and we have been able to manage ourselves effectively.\n\n\u201cI am here to deeply appreciate you for supporting me throughout my tenure as Chief Judge of the State and to also thank you for approving the process for the implementation of full autonomy for the state judiciary,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Ahead of Thursday\u2019s Federation Accounts Allocations Committee (FAAC) meeting, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) on Wednesday at its virtual meeting considered the report of a committee headed by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and accepted its recommendation that backs full deregulation of petrol, and suggests that the pump price of the product should hover around N385 per litre.\n\nThe committee also recommended that the federal government should buy 113 buses to cushion the effects of the price increase, a reliable source at the meeting told THISDAY.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s six-man committee was set up early this year by the National Economic Council (NEC) headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to look into the dwindling revenues of states and make recommendations to the council.\n\nApart from el-Rufai, Governors Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; and David Umahi of Ebonyi State are also members of the committee.\n\nThe other members of the committee are the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari.\n\nThe four governours, who are members of the committee, presented its report to their colleagues, who endorsed it.\n\nThe report is subject to final approval by NEC, which will also meet today.\n\nHowever, in a communiqu\u00e9 released after the meeting last night, the governors disclosed that el-Rufai gave a briefing on the appropriate pricing of petrol in Nigeria, where he called for full deregulation.\n\nAccording to the communiqu\u00e9, the Kaduna State governor further revealed that between N70 billion and N210 Billion is spent monthly to subsidise the petrol price at N162 per litre.\n\nThe committee identified Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Rivers and Abuja as the top consumers of petrol.\n\nPresenting the report to his colleagues, el-Rufai reportedly said the increase in the price of petrol to N385 per litre would help stem the increasing smuggling of the product to neighbouring countries.\n\nAccording to him, if petrol sells at N385 per litre, FAAC would gain between N1.3 trillion and N2. 2.3 trillion per annum.\n\nThe committee also recommended that the federal government should sell the three refineries after rehabilitation.\n\nThe report revealed that Nigeria lost billions of dollars due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that there is already a cash crunch in the states.\n\nNNPC had said that it would remit zero allocation to FAAC due to the huge cost of subsidising petrol.\n\nSome of the governors at the meeting opposed the recommendations, insisting that they will create more hardship for Nigerians.\n\nContributing to the report, a South-west governor said that it would be very difficult to convince Nigerians and labour to accept the report.\n\nBut other governors insisted that the earlier there is full deregulation, the better for the country as it remains an evil day postponed.\n\nThe committee recommended that the federal government should buy and distribute over 113 buses to states and major cities as a palliative to the proposed increase in the price of petrol.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "title": "Israel\u2019s Netanyahu \u2018Determined\u2019 to Continue Gaza Offensive",
          "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Wednesday to press ahead with a fierce military offensive in the Gaza Strip, pushing back against calls from the United States to wind down the operation that has left hundreds dead.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s tough comments marked the first public rift between the two close allies since the fighting began last week and could complicate international efforts to reach a cease-fire. His pushback also plunges the pair into a difficult early test of the U.S.-Israel relationship.\n\nIsrael continued to pound Hamas targets in Gaza with airstrikes, while Palestinian militants bombarded Israel with rocket fire throughout the day. In another sign of potential escalation, militants in Lebanon fired a rocket barrage into northern Israel.\n\nAfter a visit to military headquarters, Netanyahu said he appreciated \u201cthe support of the American president,\u201d but he said Israel would push ahead to return \u201ccalm and security\u201d to Israeli citizens.\n\nHe said he was \u201cdetermined to continue this operation until its aim is met.\u201d\n\nHe spoke shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden told Netanyahu that he expected \u201ca significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire,\u201d the White House said.\n\nThis map shows deaths across Israel and Palestinian territories. The fighting began May 10 when Hamas fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nBiden had previously avoided pressing Israel more directly and publicly for a cease-fire with Gaza\u2019s Hamas militant rulers. But pressure has been building for Biden to intervene more forcefully as other diplomatic efforts gather strength.\n\nEgyptian negotiators have also been working to halt the fighting, and an Egyptian diplomat said top officials were waiting for Israel\u2019s response to a cease-fire offer. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nMoussa Abu Marzouk, a top Hamas official, told the Lebanese station Mayadeen TV that he expected a cease-fire in a day or two.\n\nMeanwhile, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he would fly to the region Thursday for talks with Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the foreign ministers of Slovakia and the Czech Republic would join him after being invited \u201cto express their solidarity and support\u201d for Israel.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Israeli military said it was widening its strikes on militant targets in southern Gaza to blunt continuing rocket fire from Hamas. At least nine people were killed Wednesday in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe current round of fighting between Israel and Hamas began May 10, when the militant group fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.\n\nSince then, Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes that it says have targeted Hamas\u2019 infrastructure, and Hamas and other militant groups embedded in residential areas have fired some 4,000 rockets at Israeli cities, with hundreds falling short and most of the rest intercepted or landing in open areas.\n\nAt least 227 Palestinians have been killed, including 64 children and 38 women, with 1,620 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians. Hamas and Islamic Jihad say at least 20 of their fighters have been killed, while Israel says the number is at least 130. Some 58,000 Palestinians have fled their homes.\n\nTwelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a soldier, have been killed.\n\nThe rockets fired by militants in Lebanon into northern Israel threatened to open up a new front in the fighting. The rocket attack, which drew Israeli artillery fire in response but did not cause any injuries, raised the possibility of dragging Israel into renewed conflict with the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to its north.\n\nNo one claimed responsibility for the attack, and Hezbollah, which fought a monthlong war against Israel in 2006, has stayed out of the fighting for now. The rockets were widely believed to be fired by Palestinian factions based in south Lebanon.\n\nBut they cannot operate without Hezbollah\u2019s tacit consent, and the barrage appears to be carefully calibrated to send a political message that the group, which has tens of thousands of missiles, could join the battle at any time. Israel considers Hezbollah to be its most formidable threat and has threatened widespread destruction in Lebanon if war were to erupt.\n\nIn Gaza, one of the Israeli airstrikes destroyed the home of an extended family.\n\nResidents surveyed the piles of bricks, concrete and other debris that had once been the home of 40 members of al-Astal family in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. They said a warning missile struck the building five minutes before the airstrike, allowing everyone to escape.\n\nAhmed al-Astal, a university professor, described a scene of panic, with men, women and children racing out of the building.\n\n\u201cWe had just gotten down to the street, breathless, when the devastating bombardment came,\u201d he said. \u201cThey left nothing but destruction, the children\u2019s cries filling the street. \u2026 This is happening, and there is no one to help us.\u201d\n\nAnother strike in nearby Deir al-Balah killed a man, his wife and their 2-year-old daughter, witnesses said. Iyad Salha, a brother of the man who was killed, said the family had just sat down for lunch when the missile hit.\n\nAmong those killed Wednesday were a reporter for Hamas-run Al-Aqsa radio and two people who died when warning missiles crashed into their apartment.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was striking a militant tunnel network in southern Gaza, with 52 aircraft hitting 40 underground targets.\n\nMilitary officials, meanwhile, said a mysterious explosion that killed eight members of a Palestinian family on the first day of the fighting was caused by a misfired rocket from Gaza. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an Israeli attack,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman.\n\nSince the fighting began, Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, has rapidly deteriorated. Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in the territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas seized power in 2007.\n\nIsraeli attacks have damaged at least 18 hospitals and clinics and destroyed one health facility, the World Health Organization said. Nearly half of all essential drugs have run out.\n\nAmong the buildings leveled by Israeli airstrikes was one housing The Associated Press\u2019 Gaza office and those of other media outlets.\n\nNetanyahu has alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating in the building. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Israel had given the U.S. information about the bombing, without elaborating.\n\nThe AP has called for an independent investigation. The news organization\u2019s president, Gary Pruitt, has said the AP had no indication Hamas was present in the building.\n\nThe fighting, the worst since a 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, has ignited protests around the world and inspired Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories to call a general strike Tuesday. It was a rare collective action that spanned boundaries central to decades of failed peace efforts. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state.",

          "text": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp likened his side\u2019s victory at Burnley to winning \u201ca semi-final\u201d that takes them to Sunday\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d against Crystal Palace and the chance to seal a top-four finish.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s incredible win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday kept their Champions League hopes alive and at Turf Moor they built on their last-gasp weekend heroics with a victory that was much tighter than the scoreline suggests.\n\nA cool finish from Roberto Firmino turned the game Liverpool\u2019s way then a first club goal for Nathaniel Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s late drive made the points safe and improved the Reds\u2019 goal difference.\n\nThe Reds are now in the fourth Champions League spot, level on points with fifth-placed Leicester City and with a goal difference four better than the Foxes.\n\nKlopp\u2019s side host the Eagles in Roy Hodgson\u2019s last game in charge in four days\u2019 time, with 10,000 fans inside Anfield.\n\nThe Foxes are at home to Tottenham while Chelsea, who are a point better off than both, are at Aston Villa.\n\n\u201cToday was a semi-final,\u201d Klopp told Sky Sports. \u201cWe had to win the semi-final and we did.\n\n\u201cNothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That\u2019s what we needed. It\u2019s what we deserve because this was a top performance.\n\n\u201cNow we have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the 10,00 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided \u2013 Palace are strong.\u201d\n\nHaving required a sensational injury-time goal from goalkeeper Alisson to complete a comeback and beat West Brom at the weekend, the Reds endured another stressful encounter at Turf Moor.\n\nThey were harried all over the pitch throughout by a committed home side keen to impress their 3,000 fans and provide them with an end to a terrible run of home form.\n\nLiverpool struggled to deal with the Clarets\u2019 energetic pressing, especially in the first-half, with the home side\u2019s physicality posing a challenge the Reds failed at times to deal with.\n\nHowever, despite their relative inexperience at the back, Phillips and Rhys Williams did well on the whole against the in-form Chris Wood, with the former even adding a welcome goalscoring element to his play.\n\nHaving come up for a corner, the 24-year-old was perfectly placed to head home when Mane swung over a cross from the left \u2013 his first goal in what has been an unexpected but vital 20 appearances for the injury-hit Reds this season.\n\nPhillips also positioned himself perfectly on the line to clear a Ben Mee header that would have given the visitors a far more challenging final 20 minutes.\n\nAs it was, they snatched a third, with Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring his first goal \u2013 a fine finish after evading Charlie Taylor \u2013 at the end of a season hampered by injury as well as long spells on the bench.\n\nIt was Firmino\u2019s goal, though, that had much earlier provided the crucial breakthrough, his low finish from Andy Robertson\u2019s pull-back being the first shot the visitors had managed on target in a frantic and often end-to-end first half.\n\nIt was not a comfortable experience for Klopp\u2019s side but not much has been during their run of nine games unbeaten that has put them on the verge of salvaging something from this hugely disappointing season.\n\n\u201cIt never is easy,\u201d Klopp told BBC Sport. \u201cI can\u2019t remember an easy game against Burnley.\n\n\u201cWhat a job Sean Dyche is doing here. The way they play is so tricky to defend against. They are smart.\n\n\u201cApart from a nervy start passing-wise, we had to adapt to the atmosphere in the stadium, but then we played really good football.\u201d\n\nThe Reds are now into the top four for the first time since February off the back of a fourth straight victory \u2013 their longest winning run of the campaign.\n\nOne more will be enough unless Leicester run riot against Tottenham and significantly improve their goal difference.\n\nBurnley have now extended an unwanted club record to 10 consecutive top-flight home league games without a win, dating back to January.\n\nWith fans back inside Turf Moor, the home side were clearly in a mood to make amends, harrying all over the pitch, snapping into tackles and diving in to block shots.\n\nJames Tarkowski and Mee were typically combative in an attempt to protect goalkeeper Will Norris, starting his first Premier League game for the club.\n\nThings could have been different had Wood not fired an effort wide after nipping in behind the Liverpool defence to get on to a long ball forward, but this was indicative of the lack of ruthlessness that has, at times, blighted their season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a really tough season,\u201d Dyche told BBC Sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some knocks on the way.\n\n\u201cI thought we gave a good account of ourselves. We have actually played pretty well over the last few weeks but we haven\u2019t taken our chances.\n\n\u201cWe could have been effective in the final third when it really counts. That\u2019s probably been my biggest bug.\u201d\n\nThere is little more Dyche could have asked from his players both in this game and the league campaign, which has again seem them defy their relatively small budget to stay in the division.\n\nHowever Dyche will be eager to end on a high at Sheffield United before a summer that the long-serving manager will hope sees more investment than in the previous close season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a lot to do here,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cIt\u2019s a restart every summer. We will see what happens and what can be done investment wise.\n\n\u201cWe have a base here to work on and it\u2019s how we layer up on top of that to find the next generation of players to keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nLiverpool haven\u2019t lost any of the 14 Premier League matches in which Roberto Firmino has scored the opening goal of the game (W12 D2) \u2013 including winning each of the last 11 in a row.\n\nLiverpool forward Roberto Firmino is only the second player to score in three consecutive Premier League away games at Turf Moor, after Anthony Martial. Indeed, the Brazilian has now scored as many times in his last three league appearances as in the 19 matches beforehand (3).\n\nIncluding a spell at Stuttgart last season, Nathaniel Phillips\u2019 header was his first career goal as a professional, on what was his 20th appearance for Liverpool across all competitions.\n\nSince the start of last season, Burnley have lost all five of their Premier League games without Nick Pope in goal, conceding 3.4 goals per game on average, compared to just 1.2 in the 70 top-flight games in which he has started for the Clarets.\n\nSince the start of the 2017-18 season, only Kevin de Bruyne (49) has more Premier League assists than Liverpool full-back Andrew Robertson (35), who assisted twice in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2019.",

          "text": "The Kaduna state government may not attend the meeting with the Labour Minister, Dr. Chris Ngige and the NLC scheduled for Thursday, saying it has not seen any evidence that the strike has been suspended what it described as \u201ccampaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the state.\u201d\n\nThe statement issued by the spokesman of Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Muyiwa Adekeye, about three hours after the NLC announced the suspension of its warning strike, said the Kaduna State government will not participate in any negotiation or countenance one when residents of the state were still being denied their right to electricity.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Kaduna State Government is yet to see evidence that the NLC is backing off from its campaign of economic and social sabotage against the people of the State.\n\n\u201cElectric power is yet to be restored, after it was shutdown at dawn on Sunday, 16th May 2021, in brazen violation of the laws protecting essential services and infrastructure.\u201cThat action removed any basis for state government officials to meet the NLC last Sunday\u201d\n\nAdekeye stated further that \u201cDenying our people electricity about 18 hours to the advertised commencement of their organised sabotage was akin to putting a gun on the government\u2019s head. \u201cGovernment has a lawful duty not to indulge blackmail.\n\n\u201cRestoring electricity is vital to relieving some of the pain that needless acts of lawlessness have inflicted on our people. The unimpeded provision of essential services is vital to civilised order.\n\n\u201cThose who have disrupted it should promptly reverse themselves, not expect that it will be a matter for negotiation, much less being viewed as a precondition.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not participate in such a negotiation or countenance one whilst our people are still being denied their right to electricity.\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "American rapper T.I. and his wife, Tiny Harris are under investigation for sexual assault and drugging in Los Angeles, months after a string of victims came forward with allegations against the couple spanning multiple US states.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has confirmed the investigation, saying it is currently open after an unnamed woman spoke to police virtually in April.\n\nThe woman is represented by Tyrone A. Blackburn, the attorney who previously sent letters on behalf of multiple victims calling for criminal investigations into T.I. and Tiny in California and Georgia.\n\nThe couple has repeatedly denied all the allegations against them, with their attorney saying the couple has \u201cnot spoken to or been contacted by\u201d police, including in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nThe unnamed L.A. woman claimed in a police report that a man at a mall invited her to a party with T.I. and Tiny. She later met them at a club the next night, sometime between January and May in 2005. The woman remembered having two drinks at the club before Tiny gave her and her friend sips of a clear drink that tasted like Patr\u00f3n tequila but that she did not see Tiny herself drink.\n\nLater, she said she went back to T.I. and Tiny\u2019s hotel room without her friend, who was not allowed to join. She said she was then raped, calling the incident a life-altering trauma.\n\nThe Las Vegas woman, Rachelle Jenks, said she met Tiny in a bathroom at Las Vegas\u2019s McCarran International Airport on August 18, 2010, when she was 30. She said Tiny invited her to a hotel room with her and T.I. that night, and she later met the couple at the Venetian. Jenks said Tiny gave her a Patr\u00f3n shot, and she felt \u201cdizzy and confused\u201d after taking it, per the report. The couple offered Jenks marijuana soon after, which she said she took as well. She later said she performed sexual acts with the couple and told police she believed she was unable to consent because she was given an allegedly spiked drink and drugs. Ms. Jenks said she was then transported to Los Angeles by the couple and again forced to engage in sex acts.\n\nInitial allegations of sexual assault, abuse, and drugging against T.I. and Tiny, described by dozens of alleged victims on Instagram, led the couple\u2019s MTV reality series, T.I. & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle, to pause filming in February. Around that time, news also came out that T.I. would not return to \u2018Ant-Man 3.\u2019",
