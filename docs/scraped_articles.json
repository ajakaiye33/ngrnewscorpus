          "title": "Why many Nigerians stopped going to zoos \u2014Experts",
          "text": "Some experts have decried what they called disappearing zoo culture in the country, attributing it to poor maintenance of most zoological gardens and the current state of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nAnswering questions during a News Agency of Nigeria survey, the experts said that the poor state of the economy had compelled most Nigerians to consider visiting zoological gardens as secondary.\n\nA don, Prof. Lameed Gbolagade, told NAN that the current state of the economy in the country made many people prefer basic human needs, such as food, shelter, and clothing, to leisure or relaxation.\n\nAccording to Gbolagade, hardly do Nigerians consider going to zoological gardens as relevant or important any more, except students who are compelled by their various institutions and few others.\n\n\u201cZoological gardens and other places of tourism are at the receiving end of such rejection.\n\n\u201cThe money accruable from ticketing has been grossly reduced. Consequently, many animals are being starved or deprived of basic necessities,\u201d he said.\n\nGbolagade, who is from the Department of Wildlife and Ecotourism Management, University of Ibadan, however, said some zoological gardens were still managing to survive in spite of the challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have the University of Ibadan Zoological Garden, University of Ilorin Zoological Garden, FUNAAB Zoo and Obasanjo Library Zoo, among others.\n\n\u201cHowever, many zoological gardens, such as Agodi Gardens and some others, have folded up due to reasons bordering on financial incapability as well as manpower and institutional-based problems.\n\n\u201cOthers have ceased to exist due to low patronage as well as lack of good and healthy species that can be displayed in the zoo.\n\n\u201cThe species are called \u2018keystone species\u2019, such as the big five: lion, elephant, buffalo, giraffe and python/chimpanzee/gorilla, all of which can attract visitors\u2019 interests,\u201d he said.\n\nGbolagade said many people were yet to recover from Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics which, he said, were erroneously believed to be caused by exposure to wild animals.\n\nThe don added that many zoological gardens could not afford to feed their animals, pay the salaries and emoluments of their workers and meet other necessities.\n\n\u201cHowever, new zoos are coming up, either from individuals or institutions, depending on conservation interest and ability to manage the species of animals in captivity,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Dr Amos Olorunnipa, an expert in Anthropology, Cultural Studies and Heritage Consultancy, noted that there were some zoological gardens in some locations, although they might not be fully functioning.\n\n\u201cThere are zoological gardens in places like Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and Jos in Plateau,\u201d Olorunnipa said.\n\nHe attributed the closure of some zoological gardens to factors such as inadequate management, lack of enough space, food, water, and veterinary care as well as lack of interest on the part of visitors and poor finances.\n\nOlorunnipa said that zoological gardens were no longer visited regularly by most people due to the current economic hardship in the country, lack of financial backing, increase in zoo entry charges, insecurity, kidnapping, banditry and insurgency.\n\nThe don also listed COVID-19 pandemic and absence of some animals that usually attracted visitors as part of the reasons for closure of some zoological gardens.\n\n\u201cAnother likely factor may be the story of some dangerous animals already heard by the public, while some may think that visiting the zoo is not as educative nowadays as it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nOlorunnipa however, stressed the need for revival in zoo management, importation of more wild animals that could attract visitors, and intensification of public enlightenment.\n\nFor Mr Tony Adegoke, an Osogbo based zoologist, poor budgetary allocation, inadequate maintenance, and illegal killing of wildlife were major setbacks to the development and sustenance of zoological gardens in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf both the state and federal governments can allocate enough funds for the maintenance of the animals, some of the ailing zoological gardens can still come alive for the benefit of the people,\u201d Adegoke said.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The Department of State Services has filed terrorism charges against two detained aides of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja after over two months since the secret police arrested and detained the two aides of the activist and the DSS refusal to grant them bail despite a court order.\n\nIn the suit no FHC/ABJ/CR/305/2021, which was dated August 31, 2021, the DSS through its lawyer S.M. Bello, filed five terrorism charges against Noah Oyetunji and Amudat Babatunde (female).\n\nThe DSS alleged that Oyetunji was in possession of fire arms for terrorism-related activities while Babatunde promoted terroristic acts through her Facebook account.\n\nBut reacting in a chat with The PUNCH, the detainees\u2019 lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, said, \u201cThe charges are baseless, vexatious, shameful and without limbs.\u201d\n\nThe court has not fixed any date for the hearing.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the DSS, last week, freed 10 of the 12 aides of Igboho after over 60 days in detention following their arrested since July 1.\n\nThe DSS had during a midnight invasion of Igboho\u2019s Soka house in Ibadan, Oyo State, arrested 12 of the activist\u2019s allies and whisked them away to Abuja, where they had been kept in detention.\n\nThe detainees had approached the court to seek their fundamental right to freedom.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had on August 4, 2021, granted bail to the 12 detainees.\n\nThey had met their bail conditions, including the provision of 24 sureties, but the DSS lawyer, Idowu Awo, had kicked against the bail granted by Justice Egwuatu to four of them, claiming that they were heavily involved in the alleged offence of arms stockpiling and other criminal activities of their boss, Igboho.\n\nAfter a long dilly-dally, the secret police, in compliance with a court order, first released eight of the 12 detainees on Monday, August 30, 2021, holding onto the remaining four. Two more aides were freed last Friday while Babatunde and Oyetunji are still in detention.\n\nThree Senior Advocates of Nigeria \u2013 Femi Falana, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa and Ifedayo Adedipe \u2013 had said that the DSS was inviting anarchy and lawlessness into the country by not obeying the order for the release of the 12 detainees.\n\nIgboho, wanted by the DSS for alleged arms trafficking, has been in detention in Cotonou, Benin Republic, since July 19, 2021 when he was arrested at an airport as he tried to board a Germany-bound flight.\n\nDetails later\u2026",

          "text": "\u2026.Insist court can\u2019t grant a stay of execution of judgment that had been executed\n\nBy Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South\n\nLAWYERS to Lintas International owned by legal consultant and politician, Mr Ned Nwoko, have picked holes in what they alleged was a deceitful story[1]lines about the ongoing enforcement of court judgments on Paris Club Refunds by the Nigerian Governors Forum, NGF, saying the court cannot grant a stay of execution of a judgment that had been executed.\n\nIn a letter to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, dated September 6, 2021, the team of lawyers, said: \u201cThe NGF is misconceived about its powers and rights as prescribed by Section 165 of the 1999 Constitution over matters surrounding local government funds.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers led by Joe Gazadma, SAN, include Ken Njemanze, SAN, Jeph Njikonye, SAN, Onyeka Nwokolo, and Tim Odaah.\n\nThe lawyers said: \u201cThe facts and circumstances of the case at hand with respect to suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/130/ 2013, is entirely different from local government funds coming from allocations to the Federation Account. The funds involved in this case were judgment sums recovered from the Federal Government by the Linas International Limited in favour of local governments.\n\n\u201cIn the past few days, the news and social media have been awash with skewed interpretations, false narratives about the ongoing enforcement of court judgments arising from several cases with diverse factual basis, but all related to the Paris Club Refunds through the issuance of promissory notes to the judgment creditors.\n\n\u201cIt is dishonest, deceitful and malicious to pretend that it is wrong to obey court orders. It is surprising f that the body of governors, who are largely of the same party as the President and Commander-in-Chief are the one condemning him for enforcing valid court judgments.\n\n\u201cWe read in the newspapers different headlines on the matter. The frequency with which letters about claims of law suits on behalf of the NGF on this subject is released to the press betrays the intention and scheme of the NGF to suppress the facts, confuse and abuse public opinion in order to continue its resistance in taking responsibility to pay for services rendered.\n\n\u201cThe court cannot grant a stay of execution of a judgment that has been executed. Contrary to the impression created in the letter quoted in the publication under reference and other publications there is no order of court ordering the Federal Ministry of Finance to stay execution of the judgment being enforced.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is expedient to recall that on July 7, 2017, governors under the auspices of the NGF set up a committee of the governors and engaged with several consultants, including our client, at the Plateau Government Lodge, Asokoro where some of these consultancies where interrogated.\n\nFurthermore, the NGF was part of the processes that culminated in the enforcement of the court judgment in suit No. FHC/ ABJ/CS/130/2013 leading to the refunds to local governments and part payment of the consultancy fees of Linas International Limited by the Federal Government in 2018.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

But to be more real, most of the negative things said about the COVID-19 vaccine are totally erroneous and false.

We can believe him,\u201d Uyilawa said when he featured on a television program monitored in Lagos, yesterday.\n\nThe strike which began on August 2 has grounded the nation\u2019s health sector even as the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) and the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) had threatened to join in solidarity\n\nHowever, labour lawyer, Rosemary Danesi, has admonished government not to allow the strike to linger.\n\n\u201cWhen we have an agreement, we should strive to respect it. Both parties sticking to their extreme positions will not help, they should make haste and resolve things. Human lives are involved here.

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja\n\nThe Senate will on Monday commence a three-day public hearing on illegal mining and gold smuggling and the attendant losses of about $9 billion yearly to Nigeria.\n\nThe hearing is sequel to a motion moved by Abia North Senator and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nFormer Nasarawa Governor and Chairman, Senate Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines, Steel Development and Metallurgy, Tanko Al-Makura, is expected to preside over the legislative activity.\n\nThe Senate would during the hearing grill major government and non-governmental stakeholders in the mining sector over the prevalence of clandestine activities of illegal miners.\n\nAccording to a notice signed by Al-Makura, the committee extended invitations to state governors; Central Bank of Nigeria; ministers of Mines and Steel Development; Finance and Budget; Mines and Steel Development; DGs/CEOs of parastatals and agencies under the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development; Executive Secretary NEITI; Nigeria Labour Congress, Nigeria Immigration, among others.\n\nThe senate at its plenary last year had passed a resolution to investigate the losses from illegal mining activities.\n\nKalu in his motion, disclosed that Nigeria lost an estimated $54 billion from 2012 to 2018 due to illegal smuggling of gold. He also said the country was losing about $9 billion yearly to illegal mining and gold exportation. He lamented the activities of unlicensed miners and incessant smuggling of the solid minerals out of the country by middlemen given the huge revenue losses.\n\nThe former Abia governor said gold mining operations in Nigeria was capable of providing no fewer than 250,000 jobs and over $500 million dollars annually in royalties and taxes to the Federal Government.\n\nHe said jobs and revenues accruing to the mining sector would further diversify the nation\u2019s economy and improve its foreign exchange reserve. He said due to Nigeria\u2019s current estimated gold reserves of over 200million ounces, most of which have not been exploited, developing sustainable programmes that would catalyse increased investment in the extraction and refining of gold sourced from mines in Nigeria, was vital.\n\nMaking reference to data obtained from the Ministry of Solid Minerals and Development, Kalu revealed that there were gold deposits in Federal Capital Territory Abuja, Abia, Bauchi, Cross River, Edo, Niger, Sokoto, Kebbi, Oyo, Kogi, Zamfara, Osun and Kaduna states.\n\nKalu argued that if the country conserves her gold reserves, and ensures effective exploitation, the accruing revenue would surpass that of oil and gas.\n\nHe drew the attention of the senate to section 44 (3) of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Law of 1999 which provides that ownership and control of all minerals in Nigeria is vested in the Federal Government, which is mandated to manage such natural resources in a manner as may be prescribed by the National Assembly.\n\nActing on Kalu\u2019s motion , the Senate in its resolutions mandated it\u2019s Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines , Steel Development and Metallurgy to investigate and launch an investigation on the matter and report back to the Senate.\n\nOther matters scheduled for the three day public hearing include bills on Nigerian Minerals Development Corporation (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.505; Solid Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.713); and Institute of Bitumen Management (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.663).\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "\u2022Set to ban open grazing, says it\u2019s un-islamic\n\n\u2022Declares nomadic herding mustn\u2019t be encouraged in any form\n\n\u2022Identifies informants as greatest challenge to fight against insecurity\n\n\u2022President worried about selective abductions, killings, says IG\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nKatsina State Governor Aminu Masari has said with the benefit of hindsight, his government should never have negotiated with bandits, let alone grant them amnesty. Although Masari said he never regretted his decision at the time, he admitted that information available to him confirmed that engaging the bandits was not the right thing to do.\n\nConsequently, based on current understanding of the situation, the governor said he had set in motion plans to proscribe open grazing of cattle in the state. He said once certain structures were put in place for ranching, nomadic herding would be outlawed in the state.\n\nMasari disclosed these during an interview on a national television.\n\nHe insisted that open grazing of animals should not be encouraged in any form, adding that the practice is even contrary to Islamic doctrines, which forbid allowing animals into other peoples\u2019 land.\n\nThe governor of the North-west state also identified informants as the greatest challenge to the fight against insecurity in that part of the country.\n\nIn a related development, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday, said President Muhammadu Buhari was worried about the selective abductions and killings in the North-west and North-central zones of the country. Baba said the president had directed all security agencies in the country to ensure immediate end to the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, six additional Tucano fighter jets are expected in the country next week to complement the six already on the ground in the fight against insecurity.\n\nMasari, who had offered marauding gunmen amnesty, after negotiations with them, said looking back in hindsight, he should not have done that.\n\nHe said, \u201cI do not regret it. But the only thing I can say is that with the benefit of hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. We realised: who are you talking with, because they do not have an umbrella.\n\n\u201cThey are not pushing for any ideological view; they are not pushing for any religious view. They are simply bandits, criminals and thieves. Any person in the forest is a potential criminal and should be dealt with as such.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the open grazing controversy, Masari said, \u201cWe intend to ban unnecessary roaming about with cattle. But before we do that, we will make provisions where the animals will stay. I think the situation in the southern part of the country is slightly different from the northern part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the herders are from the northern part of the country. So, for us, we need a law that should be obeyed, not one that will be disregarded. For us to come up with the law we will first of all put some structures on ground, then, we will have the law that can back up the structures so that nobody would roam or move about with cattle.\n\n\u201cEven that is un-Islamic. It says do not have the numbers you cannot feed that you have to stretch over to people\u2019s land or on somebody\u2019s farm. I do not think that it is right. And, certainly, once we put in place ranching for the grazing of all animals, the issue of anybody roaming about will be a past.\u201d\n\nOn the rising incidence of armed criminality in Katsina State, Masari categorically identified majority of those involved in the act as Fulani, saying, \u201cThey are the same people like me; who speak the same language like me; who profess the same religion like me. They are not aliens. So, what we have here on ground is banditry.\n\n\u201cThey are people we know. They are people that had been living with us for 100 of years. They are also people of the Fulani extraction. Majority of those involved in this banditry are Fulani, whether it is palatable or not, but that is the truth.\n\n\u201cI did not say that 100 per cent of them are Fulani, but the majority of them are. They are people who live in the forest and their main occupation is rearing of cattle.\n\n\u201cProbably their fortunes dwindled over time with climate change and their lack of access to education, both Islamic and Western education, also aggravated the situation.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging possible infiltrations from some West and North African countries, the governor stressed that the fall of former Libya leader Muammar Ghadafi had encouraged instability and proliferation of arms and ammunitions. He urged the political leadership in northern Nigeria to summon courage and determination to end the crisis.\n\n\u201cI think it is our responsibility in Katsina and northern Nigeria to be determined to end this,\u201d he said.\n\nMasari added, \u201cThe biggest problem in our efforts and other places is their informants. They are everywhere in the markets and the villages and when they see military or police patrol they will inform.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the support the informants are giving to the bandits, which empowers them with information. Once we are able to cripple the informants, especially, by taking away the networks, the informants can no longer help them. The armed forces have their own way of communicating.\u201d\n\nThe governor explained that the bandits would be fished out and brought to book with the aid of technology and the determination of the armed forces.\n\nHe stated regarding the armed criminal gangs, \u201cThey live in the forests. The terrain is very bad and reaching them is also very difficult. But with the help of technology and what we have seen the air force is trying to do, we will be able to reach some of their camps, get their leaders and bring them to book. The efforts of the military are yielding success in reaching the most difficult areas.\n\n\u201cA lot of these areas are ungoverned, because they are forest areas. Access to them is difficult in rainy season but not impossible. With technology, we will be able to reach wherever they are and fish them out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Baba, who spoke after Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) at State House, Abuja, chaired by Buhari, said the president had directed sustained action to end the menace of selective abduction and killings in the North-central and North-west geopolitical zones.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the close-door meeting, Baba stated, \u201cThe new marching order is that all the service chiefs and intelligence chiefs have been warned to go and reinvigorate efforts and to do more so that the North-central and Nigeria at large should enjoy better security.\u201d\n\nThe IG, who acknowledged government\u2019s responsibility to secure the citizenry, admitted that more needed to be done to change the insecurity narrative pervading the North-central and North-west, as well as other parts of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe president also observed and made a remark that the constitutional responsibility of government is the provision of security, and he is ready to provide such. We should reinvigorate our efforts, which are yielding results in the North-east, South-east.\n\n\u201cBut there is more to be done in the North-central, North-west, where people are worried and he has intelligence and information that schoolchildren and students are abducted, selective abductions and killings are done. This narrative must change.\u201d\n\nThe IG added that the security chiefs had assured the president that they would try their best to improve the security narrative.\n\nBaba said on their meeting with Buhari, \u201cWe have assured him and promised that we will make efforts to do more. He also thanked and praised us for what has been done so far; that we should improve much so that people can go about their lawful businesses within the quickest possible means.\u201d\n\nMinister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), also revealed after the meeting that six more Tucano jets would be in the country by next week to boost the fight against insurgency and other criminalities bedevilling the country. Magashi stressed that the initial six Tucano jets that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of recently were currently being test run while the Chief of Air Staff would soon give further details on the issue.\n\nThe minister told journalists, \u201cWe are just testing the Tucano jets. Six are still coming by the end of, maybe, next week. So, when the 12 of them are here, I think the Chief of Air Staff will brief you on the operations that they are to undertake as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMagashi expressed government\u2019s concern over the unfolding insecurity in Zamfara State and the North-central, but assured the people of military\u2019s determination to change the narrative.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe believe that the rate at which these things are happening in Zamfara State and North-central is a source of concern to the government and to all agencies that are responsible for the execution of the operations in the North-central.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the need for urgency in our dealing with the bandits. We believe they\u2019re becoming a nuisance; killing people, they are doing what they like, they make careless statements, they say what they think they should say in order to solicit the kind of audience they want from the society.\u201d\n\nThe defence minister said the meeting also appraised the developments, generally, which required all hands on deck.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have appraised our position, we\u2019ve found that we are capable, we can do this thing, but we need the cooperation of every Nigerian in order to ensure a free society.\n\n\u201cSecurity, as far as this country is concerned, is the paramount important thing. Without security, nothing will happen and the Commander-in-Chief has emphasised this today that without security, nothing can go on. So, he has directed us to find ways, tactics and style with which we can get out of this and we assured him.\u201d\n\nFurther assuring of the preparedness of the security agencies to end the menace of insecurity in the country, Magashi said, \u201cWe will do our best to ensure the mission is successful and we will do all we can to ensure the completion of this mission, especially, when equipment and other things are available to support the course of our tactical manoeuvres and that we will do very well from now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022David Mark committee runs into brick wall\n\n\u2022NEC meeting holds Thursday\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nAhead of the September 9 National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), governors elected on the party\u2019s platform are billed to meet today to discuss and assign offices in the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nThe last NEC meeting of the party had mandated the September 9 gathering to discuss the setting up of the national convention committee as well as states and zones that would get what positions in the new NWC.\n\nThe last NEC meeting had also received a recommendation on the micro-zoning of the leadership positions, though, the NEC, the national caucus of the party, and the Board of Trustees (BoT) were silent on the zoning of the presidential ticket of the party. They insisted, as the Governor Bala Mohammed committee had suggested, that the matter be thrown open.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the meeting today in Abuja would encourage the governors to negotiate and decide offices of the NWC that would come to their respective states.\n\nAlready, Deputy National Chairman of PDP, Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, who had been acting for the national chairman, Uche Secondus, suggested at the last NEC that all members of the present NWC should go. Akinwonmi said he was tired and ready to retire to his farm in Ogun State.\n\nThe deputy national chairman\u2019s position was prompted by the fact that some members of the present NWC had already begun to eye higher elective posts in the executive arm of government.\n\nIn the micro-zoning of the NWC offices, the governors were said to be against the re-election of some NWC members as their continued stay negated their 2023 political ambitions.\n\nOne of the governors, Mohammed, was believed to be eyeing the presidential ticket of the party and, as such, uncomfortable with the aspirations of the deputy national chairman, North, Senator Nazif Suleiman. In his place, the Bauchi State governor was said to be inclined to allowing Borno State to have the office of Deputy National Chairman, North.\n\nThe party was said to be disposed to Mohammad Imam assuming the position, the reason, THISDAY gathered, being to give PDP in Borno State a sense of belonging.\n\nThough this recommendation did not stop Suleiman from contesting, as doing would amount to abridging his constitutional rights.\n\nOther NWC members affected by the micro-zoning also insisted they would go ahead and contest the offices, as the PDP constitution guaranteed them the right to contest and seek re-election.\n\nThe PDP organs championing the micro-zoning of the NWC offices, apart from the incumbent governors, include former members of the National Assembly and former governors of the party.\n\nAs at press time, former PDP members of the National Assembly had met with the NWC members at the party\u2019s secretariat on the arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, the committee set up by the national caucus of PDP to resolve the inter-party crisis might have hit a brick wall in their negotiations with the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike. The governor was said to have insisted on an undertaking by the ousted national chairman, Uche Secondus, that he would not seek re-election as national chairman at the national convention as condition for withdrawing the two court orders against Secondus at the Degema High Court in Rivers State and the Calabar High Court in Cross River State.\n\nThe Mark committee could not, however, guarantee Wike\u2019s request and the matter was left unresolved.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Mark committee would submit its report to NEC on Thursday, when the body is scheduled to meet.\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto State, in consultation with his colleagues, has summoned an extraordinary meeting of the forum today.\n\nAccording to a statement by Director General of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, Cyril Maduabum, the meeting would discuss party matters and strategies to reposition PDP ahead of the NEC meeting holding Thursday.\n\nThe PDP governors assured all PDP members, stakeholders, and the country of their commitment, determination and loyalty to the patriotic task of dislodging the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP national secretary, Senator Umaru Tsauri, has confirmed that the 93rd NEC meeting of the party would hold on Thursday. In a statement, Tsauri said, \u201cThis is to invite all members of PDP National Executive Committee to the 93rd NEC meeting scheduled as follows: date: Thursday September 09, 2021.\u201d\n\nTsauri said the time of the NEC meeting was 11am. He hinted that the Anambra National Campaign Council might be inaugurated during the open session of the meeting.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) is close to ramping up Nigeria\u2019s 36.9 billion barrels crude oil reserves by 14 billion barrels and the country\u2019s gas reserves by an additional 68 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF), Director of the organisation, Mr Sarki Auwalu, stated yesterday.\n\nSpeaking when he received the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari and top management team of the corporation in his office, Auwalu disclosed that the possibility of getting 14 billion barrels out of the 18 billion barrels in the works remains very high.\n\nAuwalu disclosed that in addition to the recent increase of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves to 206 TCF, the DPR\u2019s field analysis has shown that the possibility of proving the new oil and gas finds was becoming higher and gradually moving from P3 to P2.\n\nIn oil industry reserve classification, Proven (P1) reserve is an estimate of recoverable volume with a probability of recovery greater than 90 per cent under present technical and economic conditions, while Probable (P2) reserve is an estimate of recoverable volume with chances of recovery equal to or above 50 per cent and less than 90 per cent.\n\nIn addition, Possible (P3) reserve is an estimate of recoverable volume with a chance equal to or above 10 per cent and less than 50 per cent of being economically and technically feasible to extract.\n\n\u201cLet me take this opportunity to inform the GMD and the entire top management of the NNPC that as of last year we were able to increase the proven gas reserve to 206 TCF. This year, we have looked at the reserves of gas and those reserves are in P3 and migrating to P2.\n\n\u201cWe realised that over 68 TCF are in P3 and 75 per cent of it exists in P2 area, which is the production area. So there are several possibilities that this volume will be proven and we can increase and hit the 230 TCF before 2030.\n\n\u201cFor oil, we have discovered P3 reserves in P2 area of about 18 billion barrels and 75 per cent of this 18 billion barrels exist in the P2 production area. So the potential for us to increase about 14 billion barrels is there, and we\u2019re ready to declare this full increase to our own reserves,\u201d Auwalu stressed.\n\nHowever, he insisted that the nation\u2019s reserves production ratio was still not enough and expressed the hope that with the recent profit declared by the NNPC, it would open the floodgates for investors to come into Nigeria and put their monies in the industry.\n\nHe commended the GMD for making first profit in 44 years of the corporation\u2019s existence, the commencement of the Train 7 gas project, the OB3 project, the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) project, spearheading of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as well as many other endeavours.\n\n\u201cThe GMD within the time he took over NNPC has created a lot of landmarks and a lot of things which history will not only put them on stone but will never forget it.\n\n\u201cI can also say, with ultimate commitment, today, the whole world, after 44 years of our great NNPC it is in the first year that not only is it trying to recover but profit is declared.\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of it and we put our head very high in the committee of nations that our biggest corporation in Nigeria is no longer the way it was being seen, because of the man that came to say it is not business as usual but business unusual.\n\n\u201cAnd the GMD is here, the man sitting down here do things that are about to eliminate poverty in this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nAuwalu stated that the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d was also a signature project of the GMD as well as his decision to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to ensure openness in the national oil company.\n\nHe stated that the licences and permits as well as approvals issued by the department were in recognition of the fact that there was need to grow the oil and gas industry in the country and ensure more volumes are available for drilling.\n\nHe explained that in doing its job, the DPR had been getting a lot of support from the NNPC, whether in its efforts to boost the reservoir, exploration or production efforts.\n\nIn his comments, Kyari who hailed the DPR for its innovative solutions to industry challenges, said the fate of the oil and gas industry and by implication the prosperity of the nation rests on the shoulders of both the NNPC and the DPR.\n\nHe noted that the two organisations would not give excuses for non-performance, to Nigerians because the country deserves to get results.\n\nKyari stated that gas remains the future of energy, explaining that the DPR rather than being a mere police of the industry has become a business enabler.\n\nOn the rising prices of cooking gas, Kyari stated that the major challenge was that demand far outstrips supply, thereby creating distortions.\n\n\u201cSupply and demand is everything. Today, this country is struggling with supply of gas. We are having difficulty filling our network across the country with gas. Everyday, it is trouble to deliver gas. That means that once your supply is weak, it will affect prices.\n\n\u201cSame thing with LPG. The supply mechanism is very weak. That\u2019s why we are collaborating extensively to extract value from our gas resources and make it available to the market.\n\n\u201cOnce supply becomes high, you will definitely know that prices will be captured by the development. Gas is an internationally priced commodity. Despite this , supply and demand affect pricing. What we are doing collectively with the DPR and other agencies of government is to ensure that we deliver more gas into the domestic market,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe noted that the idea was to take gas very close to Nigerian homes and expand the gas network like what obtains in developed countries where gas cylinders are no longer needed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Warns against granting ex parte orders on political matters\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThree State Chief Judges (CJs) will any time from now appear before the National Judicial Council (NJC) to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for alleged issuance of conflicting court orders. The decision to investigate the judges was taken by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, after a meeting with seven Heads of Courts on Monday in Abuja.\n\nMuhammad had last week Monday invited some CJs to explain the rationale behind the issuance of contradictory court orders and indiscriminate injunctions by judges in their jurisdictions. The invitation was sequel to a report by THISDAY on certain worrisome restraining orders against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and some contestants in the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State, as well as the leaderships of the major political parties in the country.\n\nA statement by the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye, disclosed that the CJN, after a marathon meeting with the Heads of Courts, which lasted for over six hours, decided to use the three judges as warning to others. Although, disciplinary actions are usually taken against an erring judicial officer after investigation based on petition from members of the public, in this instance, the NJC is on its own investigating the three judges.\n\nThe statement was silent on the three judges pencilled down for investigation and possible sanction.\n\nThe CJs, who appeared before the CJN, are those of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, and Rivers, Kebbi, Cross River, Jigawa, Anambra, and Imo states.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe meeting, which commenced at 11am, and lasted till 5:30pm, began with a one-on-one interaction with the CJs. Each of the CJs was separately quizzed personally by the CJN for over an hour, before later reading a riot act in a joint session with all of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, the visibly angry CJN had stated that \u201ca damage to one jurisdiction is a damage to all\u201d and as such, they must put an end to indiscriminate granting of ex parte orders, conflicting judgements or rulings occasioned by forum-shopping.\u201d\n\nMuhammad was also quoted as saying, \u201cYour job as Heads of Court is a sacred one, and it, therefore, includes you vicariously taking the sins of others. There must be an end to this nonsense. You shall henceforth take absolute charge in assigning cases or matters, especially political personally.\n\n\u201cWe shall make example with these three Judges and never shall we condone such act.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThree of the Judges who granted conflicting ex parte orders have been invited to appear before the National Judicial Council to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for granting the conflicting ex parte orders.\u201d\n\nMuhammad warned the CJs to henceforth avoid unnecessary assumption of jurisdiction in matters with similar subjects and parties already before another court, protect the court from lawyers who were out for forum shopping, and work in tandem with all the judges to salvage the image of the judiciary.\n\nThe CJN warned the CJs against making newly appointed judicial officers vacation judges and assigning complex cases to inexperienced judges.\n\nThe statement also disclosed that all Heads of Courts will be invited to a meeting to reemphasise the need for the judiciary to be circumspect on the issue ex parte orders. It said the Heads of Courts would also meet with the NBA leadership on the issue.\n\nThe CJN advised all Heads of Court to be current on developments in the polity and the judgments delivered by courts of various jurisdictions. He also told them to urgently issue practice direction to guide judges in their various courts to avoid giving conflicting decisions.\n\nMuhammad concluded that the judiciary will no longer condone indiscipline or allow any judge to tarnish the image of the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says it will negate principle of equity\n\n\u2022 Wike to FIRS: Stop bullying corporate bodies from paying\n\n\u2022Alleges Masari, others attempting to truncate court ruling\n\n\u2022 Urges govs to collectively fight for devolution of resources\n\n\u2022 Threatens lockdown in Rivers again\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt yesterday dismissed an application by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) seeking to stop the Rivers State Government from collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with an earlier judgement in favour of the state.\n\nPam held that granting the application would negate the principle of equity.\n\nAccordingly, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike warned the FIRS against sabotaging the authority of the state to freely administer the VAT in line with the court ruling.\n\nThe FIRS in suit no FHC/PHC/149/2021 had approached the court seeking a stay-of-execution on an earlier judgement of the court that stopped the agency from collecting VAT, and held that it was constitutionally the role of state governments.\n\nThe FIRS had following the judgement against it requested the high court to stop the Rivers State government from executing the ruling.\n\nPam stated that in as much as the state government and the state legislature had enacted a law with respect to VAT, the courts were bound to obey such law. He said the state government and the House of Assembly had duly enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax No. 4, 2021, which makes it a legitimate right of the state to collect VAT.\n\nThe judge maintained that the law remained valid until it had been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nPam further said granting the prayers of the FIRS would amount to committing murder. He noted that the prayers could not stand and, hence, dismissed them.\n\nBut reacting to the Federal High Court ruling, in a state broadcast in Port Harcourt, Wike alleged that the FIRS was bullying corporate bodies and business entities in the state for refusing to pay VAT to the federal agency. He said Rivers State would not allow further collection of VAT from corporate bodies and businesses operating in the state by the federal government agency.\n\nThe governor argued that the FIRS failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgement.\n\nWike explained, \u201cFollowing the recent judgement of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, which upheld the constitutional right and authority of state governments to impose, collect and utilise VAT within their respective territorial jurisdictions, the Rivers State government enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 to regulate the effective administration of VAT in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the federal government, through the FIRS, disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of-execution of the judgement before the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cWhile the appeal was pending and without any stay-of-execution of the subsisting judgement, the FIRS went about to bully corporate bodies and business entities for paying the VAT to the Rivers State Government, even when they knew that an appeal does not serve as a stay neither was there anything to stay in a declaratory judgement.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cAs a mere agency of the federal government without any political authority, the effrontery and impunity exhibited by the FIRS against the Rivers State Government was ill-advised and highly provocative.\n\n\u201cHowever, being a government that believes in the rule of law, we decided on our own to suspend the enforcement of the Rivers State VAT Law 2021 pending the outcome of the FIRS\u2019 application for stay-of-execution.\n\n\u201cToday, the FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgement.\n\n\u201cIt is important to reiterate the fact that we did no wrong in exercising our legal right under our constitutional democracy to stop the continuing breach, denial and curtailment of the constitutional right of states to lawfully impose and collect value added and other related taxes within jurisdiction to the exclusion of the federal government.\n\n\u201cAnd in doing so, our singular and progressive objective was to contribute to the advancement of fiscal federalism by enabling the federating states to explore and exploit their potential and capacity for generating greater internal revenues with which to fund their development goals and reduce the out-dated over-reliance on pitiable federal allocation and other hand-outs.\u201d\n\nWike stressed that Rivers State would not tolerate any further attempt by the FIRS to sabotage or undermine its authority to freely administer VAT and other related laws in the state, saying, \u201cthose who play with fire risks having their fingers burnt. Enough of the shenanigans.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that some states currently with low economic activities and ethically restrictive social policies, with economic implications, might be adversely affected for now, but pointed out that it was not Rivers State\u2019s making.\n\nWike state, \u201cLike the right to derivation, this is also a constitutional prescription, which we all swore as political leaders to respect and defend as the supreme law of the land.\n\n\u201cAbove all, fiscal federalism remains the right path to economic self-reliance and sustainability for all our states and the benefits derivable from this case by all the states in the long run far outweighs the immediate revenue loss that some states may presently suffer.\n\n\u201cAll that is required is for all of us to wear our thinking caps as elected governors to collectively fight for the greater devolution of resources, responsibilities and powers to the federating states.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very unfortunate that some state governors, led by that of Katsina State, are vainly conspiring to truncate this progressive reality in favour of the inequitable status quo so that the federal government can continue to rob Peter to pay Paul as the nation\u2019s self-imposed tax master-general.\u201d\n\nWike said the state government would continue to ensure and project constitutional rights to access all possible resources that could take hold both within and outside the geographical boundaries to advance the progress of the state.\n\nHe, therefore, directed the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to ensure the full and total implementation and enforcement of the law against all corporate bodies, business entities and individuals with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAll corporate bodies, business entities and individuals are advised to willingly, truthfully and promptly comply with their tax obligations under this law to avoid the full weight of the stipulated sanctions, including having their business premises sealed-up.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the governor warned that it might re-impose a lockdown across the 23 local government areas of the state if residents continued to neglect the COVID-19 protocols. Wike disclosed that the rate of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly in the state, as reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He urged Rivers residents to comply with the protocols and take their vaccines.\n\nThe governor appealed to religious leaders and churches to convince and encourage their followers and members to go out and take the vaccines and comply with the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe daily figures released from the NCDC show that both the transmission and death rates in the last two weeks have consistently been on a rising spiral because residents and visitors to the state have largely abandoned their responsibility to comply with the existing COVID-19 protocols.\n\n\u201cClearly, we are headed for a serious health disaster of profound consequences if residents and visitors continue to behave as if the pandemic no longer exists or impotent in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThis is a big lie and we cannot afford to continue to close our eyes to the dangers such irresponsible behaviour pose to the health, lives and livelihood of everyone.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I wish to remind residents of the subsisting protocols on regular washing of hands and use of alcohol-based sanitisers; maintaining social distancing; wearing of face masks at all public places, including transport vehicles and going for immediate testing and treatment whenever you notice any of the symptoms.\n\n\u201cAlthough it remains our desire to keep the state open and allow citizens to go about their social, religious and economic activities unimpeded.\n\n\u201cBut we may be constrained to re-impose the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the state if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it has been proven that vaccinations are saving lives here and across the world and those refusing to take the vaccines for no certified medical reasons should know that they are endangering the rest of the citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Accordingly, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike warned the FIRS against sabotaging the authority of the state to freely administer the VAT in line with the court ruling.\nThe FIRS had following the judgement against it requested the high court to stop the Rivers State government from executing the ruling.\nHe said the state government and the House of Assembly had duly enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax No.\nHe said Rivers State would not allow further collection of VAT from corporate bodies and businesses operating in the state by the federal government agency.\n\u201cAs expected, the federal government, through the FIRS, disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of-execution of the judgement before the Federal High Court.",

          "title": "How Wave became Francophone Africa\u2019s first unicorn startup with \"radically affordable\" money transfers",
          "text": "Within four years, Wave has gone from a spinoff from Asia and Africa-focused cheap remittance company, Sendwave, to a mobile money service provider worth $1.7 billion; the latest unicorn startup in Africa and the first in the French-speaking region.\n\nThe billion-dollar valuation comes after it raised $200 million in a Series A round led by payments giant Stripe; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and unit of Sequoia; Founders Fund; and Ribbit Capital, with participation from other existing investors.\n\nNo other startup operating in Africa has raised as much in a Series A. OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise. All were Series C rounds.\n\nTaking on incumbents\n\nSenegal is one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing mobile money markets, according to a 2020 GSMA report.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of eight French-speaking countries in the region (including Senegal), allowed nonbanks to operate mobile money in its member states. Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu have tasked universities and research institutions to work in synergy in pursuit of the country\u2019s economic prosperity and technological advancement.\n\nThe duo made the call when the minister paid the governor a courtesy visit at the Government House in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nObaseki, who commended the minister for his efforts at uniting institutions across the country to propel development in the nation, called on the Federal Government to allow states to have significant control over research institutes, particularly that of oil palm and rubber.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are proud of your initiative in trying to bring everybody together under one sector, which is the Nigerian sector: the ministry is an enabler in the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cWhat you have started is the right way to go and we have no choice, but execution is the issue. There is nothing new in this country, but everything said has been written and researched over again. Things have not changed because of self-interest, not national interest.\n\n\u201cI assure the minister that Edo State is ready to work with the ministry as the state is blessed with different federal institutions in the state, but they work independently rather than working together to develop the state and nation at large.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIf we want to thoroughly develop this country, the Federal Government should understand that the ministry is an instigator, as well an enabler that makes things happen.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be responsible for making sure that all the institutions in the state deliver to the people; whether in industry, agriculture, or all other sectors in the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Onu said the synergy among the institutions was imperative to boost the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAll the centres of knowledge in the nation; be it university, research laboratories, institutes, or polytechnics, have all been working independently on their own as if others don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not good enough for Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cIt has created a tremendous problem for the nation, as we have our problems that we need to collaborate to solve, but instead, we now import everything that we need. It\u2019s not good for us as a nation. We now export jobs and have a serious unemployment problem in the country. This can only be checked if we start producing in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe minister further stated: \u201cWe want to establish technology and innovation centres for global competitiveness. These centres will be established in the six geo-political zones as all the universities, polytechnics, research laboratories and institutes in each of the zones will come together to collaborate in order to help accelerate development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer allow all these centres of knowledge to work independently, but rather start working together to enable them to carry out good research that will solve the nation\u2019s problems. The collaboration will enable commercialization, and standardization will be made easy.\u201d\n\n...",

From the weekend till date, we have had a total of 8 deaths,\u201d Osagie noted.\n\nHe said three out of the four deaths recorded in the state are unvaccinated, while the other one was partially vaccinated, adding that taking just one dose of the vaccine is not enough to prevent the virus from affecting people.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhen you have partial vaccination, it covers you for a period of time pending when the coverage expires. To be protected, one needs to be fully vaccinated by ensuring one takes the two doses of the vaccines. You must complete the vaccination; you can\u2019t take one dose and say it is enough but need to complete the dose which protects you from the virus. We should ensure that we get fully vaccinated as the risk is getting high.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Health Dr. Osawonyi Irowa, noted that government\u2019s aim is to minimize COVID-19 avoidable deaths, urging citizens to keep off from crowded environments, ensure the compulsory wearing of facemasks and obey the non-pharmaceutical protocols against the spread of the virus.\n\nHe added: \u201cOne jab will not protect you as only the two jabs will do. Each jab protects you for a certain period. I urge Edo citizens to please show up for their second dose as there is enough for them.\n\n\u201cMany persons carrying the virus are not down with sickness and don\u2019t have symptoms but yet transmit the virus to people.

It is a major encouragement for our teams and partners, and a great recognition of more than 15 years of engagement to make our company and the world greener and more inclusive. Sustainability is a journey that we accomplish with our people, partners, suppliers, customers and communities where we operate. This recognition goes also to all of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Corporate Knights, Schneider Electric has helped customers manage their energy needs more efficiently and safely.\n\nCorporate Knights\u2019 2021 ranking was based on an assessment of 8,080 companies with more than US$1 billion in revenues. Performance indicators include evaluations of how much renewable energy and waste companies generate\n\nSpeaking, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Corporate Knights, Toby Heaps said,\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, Schneider Electric has shifted its focus to data centres; storage and other distributed energy resources; and smart solutions that advance electrification, energy efficiency and renewability. It now earns 70% of its revenue from, and directs 73% of its investments toward, sustainable solutions, Schneider Electric also performs strongly in racial and gender diversity and in resource productivity and safety.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, General Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa, Process Automation, Schneider Electric, Ajibola Akindele, has called on stakeholders of Nigeria\u2019s power sector to augment investment in the power sector so as to enable the country achieve her industrialization goal.\n\nAkindele who gave the charge recently, in an interview with Arise TV, averred that, the country needs to create the necessary framework for private sector investments.\n\n\u201cWe have had several years of under-investment in the power sector.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at the last 30 years, particularly between 1989, to 2007, there was no major investment in the power sector.\n\n\u201cThe country was just spending enough to stabilize the grid infrastructure.

All available funding options must be explored and investors should be given the necessary incentives and where necessary guarantees to ensure they can make a decent return on their investments.\n\nHe hinted that, although in recent times, there has been some positive developments in the power sector, it was still not adequate; hence the need to move much faster to improve electrification rates and reliability of the grid.\n\n...",

          "title": "UPDATED: Again INEC, NASS bicker over electronic transmission of election results",
          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the National Assembly on Tuesday countered each other over the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nAgainst the stance of the National Assembly mandating the commission to get the approval of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for e-transmission of results, INEC said it does not owe the latter such constitutional obligation.\n\n\u201cThat is absolutely unconstitutional. You cannot ask INEC to seek the approval of another agency of government to transmit results electronically when actually INEC has power to impose duties on NCC to achieve electronic transmission of results.\n\n\u201cI completely agree that in the context of underscoring the independence of the commission, section 160 of the Constitution has done everything it needs to do. What is left is for INEC to use the power it has under the constitution to achieve its aim,\u201d INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of Electoral Operations and Logistic Committee, Okechukwu Ibeanu, reportedly said at the commission\u2019s third quarterly meeting of INEC with media executives in Abuja.\n\nBefore proceeding on recess in July, the National Assembly, while voting on the amendment to the Electoral Act, rejected the section on electronic transmission of election results by INEC, saying the country was not ready for such.\n\nThe amended electoral act, if signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, is expected to improve the quality of Nigeria\u2019s elections. Many observers have, however, faulted the lawmakers\u2019 decision on the electronic transmission of results; saying that by making it subject to the approval of the NCC, the lawmakers were hindering INEC\u2019s independence and efficiency.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES also reported how the NCC misled the lawmakers into believing that the country was not technologically prepared for electronic transmission of election results.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the media executives and civil society organisations, INEC\u2019s Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, reiterated the commission\u2019s intention to proceed with making the electoral system more credible through the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nHe said the BVAS would eliminate the electorate\u2019s fear of identity theft as it would replace the Smart Card Reader (SCR) and Z-pad.\n\nSenate Frowns\n\nIn his reaction to INEC\u2019s latest stance on electronic transmission of results, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Ajibola Basiru, told the PUNCH newspaper that Mr Yakubu had misinterpreted item 22 and Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution and thereby misinformed the public.\n\n\u201cINEC, in implementing the law, becomes independent pursuant to the constitutional provision. He (INEC chairman) should not muddle the independence of INEC with that of its agency\u2019s operations, as to the legislative competence of the National Assembly to stipulate framework for elections.\n\n\u201cThe INEC chairman does not seem to know the position of the law as to the constitutional power of INEC vis a vis the National Assembly from what he said. I will advise him to seek proper legal advice,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP, APC react\n\nSpeaking on the matter, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said INEC does not require the approval of the NCC to transfer election results electronically since the constitution has given the commission the right to set a template for a smooth election.\n\n\u201cThe law establishing INEC gives it powers to set the template for the smooth conduct of elections; it was the same law it used to introduce the card reader which has improved our electoral system,\u201d the PDP spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, said.\n\nOn its part, the APC, which controls both chambers of the National Assembly, has been evasive on taking a formal stance on INEC\u2019s position on electronic transmission of results. Although the majority of the lawmakers who voted against INEC\u2019s request to transmit results electronically are members of the APC, the party has refused to formally make its position known.\n\nWhen asked to speak on the matter on Tuesday, the interim secretary of the ruling party, John Akpanudoedehe, simply spoke on INEC\u2019s independence.\n\n\u201cINEC is the regulator of political parties; political parties can\u2019t tell it what to do. The APC, as you know, is a law-abiding party; we are always guided by the provisions of the law,\u201d Mr Akpanudoedehe said.",
          "summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the National Assembly on Tuesday countered each other over the electronic transmission of election results.\nYou cannot ask INEC to seek the approval of another agency of government to transmit results electronically when actually INEC has power to impose duties on NCC to achieve electronic transmission of results.\nBefore proceeding on recess in July, the National Assembly, while voting on the amendment to the Electoral Act, rejected the section on electronic transmission of election results by INEC, saying the country was not ready for such.\nPREMIUM TIMES also reported how the NCC misled the lawmakers into believing that the country was not technologically prepared for electronic transmission of election results.\nOn its part, the APC, which controls both chambers of the National Assembly, has been evasive on taking a formal stance on INEC\u2019s position on electronic transmission of results.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Osun State chapter, on Tuesday staged a welcome back rally for their gubernatorial candidate for 2018 governorship election, Senator Nurudeen Ademola Adeleke as he came back home from the United States of America where he had gone to add value to himself.\n\nThe rally which took place at the state secretariat of the party, Biket junction, Osogbo/Ikinrun Road, witnessed mamoth crowd of the party faithful.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the state chairman of the party, Hon. Sunday Bisi said it gladdens their heart that in spite of the vicious political manipulation which robbed Senator Adeleke of the Governorship position in 2018 and the naked use of state power to harass him, the governorship candidate of the party had deemed it fit to immediately use the period after the election in a very productive and rewarding manner.\n\nHe said instead of whining in bitterness or even creating mischief to protest the controversial desicions of the courts after the 2018 elections, Senator Adeleke stayed focused on personal self development and positive engagements as a true democrat and reminiscent of historical values of your dynasty.\n\nBisi appluaded the former Senator for towing a line of self development and concentrating on having better political future rather than been pessimistic.\n\n\u201cWe love your courage and we appreciate your disposition as a man of peace. We are covinced that you are a man on divine purpose. Your unflinching effort at reinvigorating the party even while in far away United States of America depicts you as vessel of love, who will spare nothing to emancipate the good people of Osun State\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the honours you attained and even more proud of the heart warming recommendations of the college authorities and your coursemates. You have demonstrated beyond doubt that where there is a will, there will also be a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the additional feat to previous ones in the social, economic and political spheres, you have assured us that you are better positioned to drive the process of growth in our dear state and Nigeria as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me use this medium to warn those who feel they can subdue our party with force of violence to desist forthwith. Such vain effort cannot get at us as our courage is too fortified to be discouraged\u201d\n\n\u201cTesting the will of our people through any form of violence is an effort in futility but stretching it further will backfire. We will not warn you again\u201d\n\n\u201cOn our part as a party, we pray the Almighty God grants Senator Adeleke good health and sound mind to continually be of service to Osun State, Nigeria and humanity in general\u201d\n\nWhile speaking, Senator Adeleke thanked the teeming party supporters and the leaders of the party for still believing in him.\n\nHe appraised their resilience and relentless effort in building the party, adding that he\u2019s coming back home would be used to unify the party.\n\nAdeleke averred that he has back fully to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state to salvage the good people of the state from the maladministration of the present government.\n\nHe implored all the party members to work in unity, adding that, the party is one, and must be one for the betterment of the good people of the state.\n\nHe, however, condemned in totality, attack on the party secretariat by some hoodlums, calling for crisis free political atmosphere.",

          "text": "The Federal Government says it has reached a truce with aggrieved health workers of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and assembly of healthcare professions.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, said this while addressing newsmen at the end of a five-hour conciliation meeting with the leadership of JOHESU on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt would be recalled that JOHESU had on Sept. 3 issued a 15-day ultimatum to the federal government to meet their demands or face an indefinite strike.\n\nNgige said that an understanding was reached by both parties, the meeting was fruitful and that the Memorandum of Understanding would be signed next week.\n\nHe said they discussed in a fraternal way and reached an understanding on all the issues in dispute.\n\nAccording to him, this includes the enhancement of hazard allowance, review of retirement age from 60 to 65 years, the arrears of the consequential adjustment of the national minimum wage.\n\nHe added that understanding was reached on the upward adjustment of Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) as done with Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS).\n\nThe minister said there was no problem with the old issues, while the meeting agreed that the new issues should return to their employer, the Federal Ministry of Health, for discussions.\n\nOn the hazard allowance, Ngige noted that the federal government had held four meetings earlier with JOSEHU and Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) alongside their affiliates, but at a point, there were areas of departure.\n\nHe said that NMA and a union hitherto thought to be part of JOHESU, demanded for the compartmentalisation of the discussions on the hazard allowance, which the government granted.\n\n\u201cBased on previous discussion, we delivered to them (JOHESU) the financial implication of what is due to them and they promised to get back to their members and report back to us.\n\n\u201dOn the other hand, government is meeting with NMA next week for their separate discussion on hazard allowance. Already the federal government has budgeted the sum of N37.5 billion for this.\n\n\u201cThe issue was resolved to the satisfaction of all of us. The government is not delaying the hazard allowance as some people want the public to believe.\n\n\u201dSince the past six months, government has been making concerted efforts to push the new hazard allowance into effect, which we are doing now but for disagreement between NMA and JOHESU,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the upward review of retirement age from 60 to 65 years, Ngige said that the meeting received reports from the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation and the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to him, both agreed on the reality of the proposal.\n\nHe added that the matter had already been handled by the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation which had in turn transmitted same to the National Council on Establishment for further processing at its meeting in December.\n\nNgige disclosed that the meeting agreed that the issues of non-implementation of allowances contained in the 2017 agreement, such as consequential minimum wage adjustment and skipping, would be taken holistically.\n\nOn the issue of the non-adjustment of CONHESS as done in CONMESS, the minister said that the matter was in the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) for adjudication.\n\nHe said, following a litigation engendered by a civil society organisation, the court remitted the issue back to JOHESU and its employer, the Federal Ministry of Health, for discussion.\n\nNgige said that they agreed at the meeting that if the discussions fail, the matter should be brought back for conciliation.\n\nHe added that the meeting further resolved that other issues brought up by JOHESU, such as the 30 per cent of shift duty allowance to nurses and others, payment of outstanding allowance to intern health professionals.\n\nAccording to him, others include the payment of teaching allowance to JOHESU members on CONHESS 7 and 8, as well as skipping arrears should be handled expeditiously by the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nThe minister also noted that the resolution of issues affecting their members in the state health institutions was for the Council on Health, adding that the Federal Ministry of Health has been directed to receive them and forward to the council.\n\nHe added that JOHESU will meet with the Federal Ministry of Health on Thursday to draw up a framework for all the discussions to start.\n\n\u201cWe will be ready to address all the issues. But we agreed that as a result of the perilous state of economy, the principle of capacity to pay will guide all our discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JOHESU President, Mr Josiah Biobelemonye, noted that \u201cstrike is not the way to go\u201d, and expressed optimism that all issues raised by the unions would be positively attended to.

          "text": "Disturbed by the rising wave of insecurity, Governor Akeredolu lamented yesterday that Nigerians were living in fear, following the unending insecurity across the country, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately rise to the occasion.\n\nHe spoke as Katsina State governor Aminu Bekko Masari, on Monday night, expressed regret over the amnesty he granted bandits in his state a few years ago.\n\nAkeredolu, who spoke while receiving members of the Governing Board of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, FUTA, led by the chairman, Ambassador Godknows Boladei Igali, in his office in Akure, said: \u201cThe people are living in fear and something must be done urgently to address the situation and restore hope to the people.\n\n\u201cLook at what is happening in Zamfara. They try to clothe it and call them bandits. They are terrorists. So, the growth in science can not be based on just your charge but the conducive environment in the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed the need to make the country livable for the people, so they could harness their talents for national growth.\n\n\u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s goals for science and technological advancement, the country must be made conducive for living, particularly for the young ones.\n\n\u201cFor us in science and technology, we need to do more. Japanese, Chinese and other developed countries send people to where science is the best. We have heard of countries that send their people to the USA to train in science and technology.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stay there. They went back to their countries to develop them. Commitment to one\u2019s country is key. But we need to make this country a livable place so that the young ones will be confident and have hope to live in this country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSpeaking on open grazing, Akeredolu emphasised the need for the country to embrace modern ways of animal husbandry, describing open grazing as old and now illegal in Ondo State.\n\n\u201cToday, I can say there are modern ways of animal husbandry and we have to take the bull by the horns. We are not afraid to take decisions. Modernity has taught us that you can extract more milk from cows in a modern way better than when you take them from one place to another. It is about science. People have developed that science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy when I see Mr President go to Katsina and visit his cows. They are well kept. We must embrace technology of animal husbandry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor described FUTA as one of the leading universities in the country, particularly in terms of research.\n\n\u201cWe take pride in FUTA and its achievements over time. And I have had serious connections with FUTA not only as a governor.\n\n\u201cWe have strong relationship with FUTA. FUTA for us is one of the leading universities of technology in Nigeria if not the leading one. One of our lecturers won the best researcher award in the country. I congratulate you,\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nEarlier, the chairman of the governing council, Ambassador Godknows Boladei Igali, who was accompanied by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Joseph Adeola Fuwape, lauded the strides of the governor.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bello Aminu Masari of Katsina State has expressed regrets for granting bandits amnesty in the past.\n\nHis regrets came against the backdrop of repeated calls by Islamic scholar, Sheikh Mohammad Gumi that bandits be granted amnesty to stop banditry in the country.\n\nThis is even as President Buhari also yesterday, gave marching orders to heads of security agencies to end what he described as selective abductions and killings, particularly in the North-Central and North-West zones of the country.\n\nMasari, whose reaction came in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s programme, Politics Today, on Monday night, said with recent activities of bandits and information now at his disposal, he wouldn\u2019t have granted amnesty to bandits as he did sometime ago.\n\nNoting that the amnesty he granted the bandits then did not yield any positive result, the governor said:\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have granted bandits amnesty, if\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cThe only thing I say is, with the benefit of hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. Because at that time when we started in 2016, there were leaders (bandits) but gradually, all the leaders were eliminated, that was the failure of the first round.\n\n\u201cThe second round after the 2019 election didn\u2019t see the light of the day. We tried but then we realised that, \u2018who are you talking to?\u2019\n\n\u201cThey are not under the same umbrella. They are not pushing for any religious belief. They are just bandits, criminals, and thieves.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said bandits pose great danger to society as their mission is to steal and kill and should, therefore, be treated as criminals.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, there is nobody in the forests that can discuss peace. For me, anybody in the forests is a potential criminal, so I think it should be dealt with as such,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also hinted that his administration is considering banning open grazing in the state but insisted that before banning open grazing, provision would be made for alternatives.\n\nGovernor Masari had earlier on Monday, inaugurated a committee to monitor and enforce the recently introduced executive order in the state and announced a ban on commercial charging of phones.\n\nAccording to him, this is part of efforts to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe latest instruction we gave out is the closure of all commercial charging points in the most affected local government areas. Commercial charging, we believe, is also an area which is helping the bandits to acquire means of communication,\u201d he said.\n\nEx-Katsina TV GM, daughter, abducted\n\nAs the interview progressed, the bandits were at their game, as they abducted the former General Manager of Katsina State Television, KTTV, Ahmed Abdulkadir and his 15-year-old daughter, Laila, at his residence at Bakori Local Government Area.\n\nAlthough police authorities in the state are yet to respond to the incident, locals confirmed that the bandits stormed Abdulkadir\u2019s house around 9:00 pm.\n\nIt was learned that the incident took place less than six hours after the state government banned all mobile phone commercial charging points in 18 local government areas in the state as part of measures to tackle the scourge of banditry. Bakori is one of the LGAs affected by the ban.\n\nAlso in the early hours of Monday, gunmen stormed Sabuwar Kasa village in Kafur Local Government Area and abducted four children of the village head.\n\nEnd killings, abductions in N-west, N-Central, Buhari urges security chiefs\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday gave marching orders to heads of security agencies to end what he described as selective abductions and killings, particularly in the North-Central and North-West.\n\nBuhari, who gave the order after briefings from security heads at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, commended them for their efforts so far, which he said are yielding positive results in the North-East and South-East.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was made known to State House correspondents by Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Usman Alkali.\n\nHe said the President also directed the security chiefs to redouble their efforts to restore security across the country to enable citizens go about their normal businesses.\n\nThe IGP said: \u201cYes, we had a brief security meeting. Service chiefs and the intelligence chiefs have been able to brief the President on the security situation of the country.\n\nMarching Order\n\n\u201cThe new marching order is that all the service chiefs and intelligence chiefs have been warned to go and reinvigorate efforts and do more so that the North-Central and Nigeria at large should enjoy better security.\n\n\u201cThe President has also observed and made a remark that the constitutional responsibility of government is the provision of security and is ready to provide such.\n\n\u201cWe should reinvigorate our efforts, which are yielding results in the North-East, South-East, but there is more to be done in the North-Central, North-West, where people are worried and he has intelligence and information that school children and students are abducted, selective abductions and killings are done. This narrative must change.\n\n\u201cWe have assured and promised him that we\u2019ll make efforts to do more. He also thanked and praised us for what had been done so far, that we should improve much so that people can go about their lawful businesses within the quickest possible time.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the IGP, who gave insight into what transpired during the closed-door meeting, acknowledged the government\u2019s responsibility to provide security for citizens, admitting that more needed to be done to change the insecurity narrative pervading the North-Central and the North-West.\n\nGovt worried over situation in Zamfara, N-Central, says Defence Minister\n\nAlso fielding questions, Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi, retd, expressed government\u2019s concern over the security situation in Zamfara State and the North-Central, and assured of the military\u2019s determination to change the narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe believe that the spate at which these things are happening in Zamfara State and North-Central is a source of concern to the government and to all agencies that are responsible for the execution of operations in the North-Central.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the need for urgency in our dealing with the bandits. We believe they\u2019re becoming a nuisance; killing people, they are doing what they like, they make careless statements, they say what they think they should say in order to solicit the kind of audience they want from the society.\u201d\n\nMagashi said the meeting also appraised developments generally which, according to him, require all hands to be on deck, with a view to halting the menace.\n\n\u201cWe have appraised our position, we\u2019ve found that we are capable, we can do this thing, but we need the cooperation of every Nigerian in order to ensure a free society,\u201d he said.\n\nAssuring of the preparedness of the security forces to end the menace of banditry, among others, in the country, the Minister said: \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to ensure the mission is successful and we\u2019ll do all we can to ensure the completion of this mission, especially when equipment and other things are available to support the course of our tactical manoeuvres and that we\u2019ll do very well from now.\u201d\n\nOn the status of the Super Tocano jets recently procured to enhance military operations in the country, Magashi said: \u201cWe are just testing them, six are still coming maybe next 12 of them are here, I think the Chief of Air Staff will brief you on the operations that they are to undertake as soon as possible.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Disturbed by the rising wave of insecurity, Governor Akeredolu lamented yesterday that Nigerians were living in fear, following the unending insecurity across the country, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately rise to the occasion.\n\nHe spoke as Katsina State governor Aminu Bekko Masari, on Monday night, expressed regret over the amnesty he granted bandits in his state a few years ago.\n\nAkeredolu, who spoke while receiving members of the Governing Board of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, FUTA, led by the chairman, Ambassador Godknows Boladei Igali, in his office in Akure, said: \u201cThe people are living in fear and something must be done urgently to address the situation and restore hope to the people.\n\n\u201cLook at what is happening in Zamfara. They try to clothe it and call them bandits. They are terrorists. So, the growth in science can not be based on just your charge but the conducive environment in the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed the need to make the country livable for the people, so they could harness their talents for national growth.\n\n\u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s goals for science and technological advancement, the country must be made conducive for living, particularly for the young ones.\n\n\u201cFor us in science and technology, we need to do more. Japanese, Chinese and other developed countries send people to where science is the best. We have heard of countries that send their people to the USA to train in science and technology.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t stay there. They went back to their countries to develop them. Commitment to one\u2019s country is key. But we need to make this country a livable place so that the young ones will be confident and have hope to live in this country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSpeaking on open grazing, Akeredolu emphasised the need for the country to embrace modern ways of animal husbandry, describing open grazing as old and now illegal in Ondo State.\n\n\u201cToday, I can say there are modern ways of animal husbandry and we have to take the bull by the horns. We are not afraid to take decisions. Modernity has taught us that you can extract more milk from cows in a modern way better than when you take them from one place to another. It is about science. People have developed that science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy when I see Mr President go to Katsina and visit his cows. They are well kept. We must embrace technology of animal husbandry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor described FUTA as one of the leading universities in the country, particularly in terms of research.\n\n\u201cWe take pride in FUTA and its achievements over time. And I have had serious connections with FUTA not only as a governor.\n\n\u201cWe have strong relationship with FUTA. FUTA for us is one of the leading universities of technology in Nigeria if not the leading one. One of our lecturers won the best researcher award in the country. I congratulate you,\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nEarlier, the chairman of the governing council, Ambassador Godknows Boladei Igali, who was accompanied by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Joseph Adeola Fuwape, lauded the strides of the governor.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bello Aminu Masari of Katsina State has expressed regrets for granting bandits amnesty in the past.\n\nHis regrets came against the backdrop of repeated calls by Islamic scholar, Sheikh Mohammad Gumi that bandits be granted amnesty to stop banditry in the country.\n\nThis is even as President Buhari also yesterday, gave marching orders to heads of security agencies to end what he described as selective abductions and killings, particularly in the North-Central and North-West zones of the country.\n\nMasari, whose reaction came in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s programme, Politics Today, on Monday night, said with recent activities of bandits and information now at his disposal, he wouldn\u2019t have granted amnesty to bandits as he did sometime ago.\n\nNoting that the amnesty he granted the bandits then did not yield any positive result, the governor said:\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have granted bandits amnesty, if\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cThe only thing I say is, with the benefit of hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. Because at that time when we started in 2016, there were leaders (bandits) but gradually, all the leaders were eliminated, that was the failure of the first round.\n\n\u201cThe second round after the 2019 election didn\u2019t see the light of the day. We tried but then we realised that, \u2018who are you talking to?\u2019\n\n\u201cThey are not under the same umbrella. They are not pushing for any religious belief. They are just bandits, criminals, and thieves.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said bandits pose great danger to society as their mission is to steal and kill and should, therefore, be treated as criminals.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, there is nobody in the forests that can discuss peace. For me, anybody in the forests is a potential criminal, so I think it should be dealt with as such,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also hinted that his administration is considering banning open grazing in the state but insisted that before banning open grazing, provision would be made for alternatives.\n\nGovernor Masari had earlier on Monday, inaugurated a committee to monitor and enforce the recently introduced executive order in the state and announced a ban on commercial charging of phones.\n\nAccording to him, this is part of efforts to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe latest instruction we gave out is the closure of all commercial charging points in the most affected local government areas. Commercial charging, we believe, is also an area which is helping the bandits to acquire means of communication,\u201d he said.\n\nEx-Katsina TV GM, daughter, abducted\n\nAs the interview progressed, the bandits were at their game, as they abducted the former General Manager of Katsina State Television, KTTV, Ahmed Abdulkadir and his 15-year-old daughter, Laila, at his residence at Bakori Local Government Area.\n\nAlthough police authorities in the state are yet to respond to the incident, locals confirmed that the bandits stormed Abdulkadir\u2019s house around 9:00 pm.\n\nIt was learned that the incident took place less than six hours after the state government banned all mobile phone commercial charging points in 18 local government areas in the state as part of measures to tackle the scourge of banditry. Bakori is one of the LGAs affected by the ban.\n\nAlso in the early hours of Monday, gunmen stormed Sabuwar Kasa village in Kafur Local Government Area and abducted four children of the village head.\n\nEnd killings, abductions in N-west, N-Central, Buhari urges security chiefs\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday gave marching orders to heads of security agencies to end what he described as selective abductions and killings, particularly in the North-Central and North-West.\n\nBuhari, who gave the order after briefings from security heads at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, commended them for their efforts so far, which he said are yielding positive results in the North-East and South-East.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was made known to State House correspondents by Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Usman Alkali.\n\nHe said the President also directed the security chiefs to redouble their efforts to restore security across the country to enable citizens go about their normal businesses.\n\nThe IGP said: \u201cYes, we had a brief security meeting. Service chiefs and the intelligence chiefs have been able to brief the President on the security situation of the country.\n\nMarching Order\n\n\u201cThe new marching order is that all the service chiefs and intelligence chiefs have been warned to go and reinvigorate efforts and do more so that the North-Central and Nigeria at large should enjoy better security.\n\n\u201cThe President has also observed and made a remark that the constitutional responsibility of government is the provision of security and is ready to provide such.\n\n\u201cWe should reinvigorate our efforts, which are yielding results in the North-East, South-East, but there is more to be done in the North-Central, North-West, where people are worried and he has intelligence and information that school children and students are abducted, selective abductions and killings are done. This narrative must change.\n\n\u201cWe have assured and promised him that we\u2019ll make efforts to do more. He also thanked and praised us for what had been done so far, that we should improve much so that people can go about their lawful businesses within the quickest possible time.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the IGP, who gave insight into what transpired during the closed-door meeting, acknowledged the government\u2019s responsibility to provide security for citizens, admitting that more needed to be done to change the insecurity narrative pervading the North-Central and the North-West.\n\nGovt worried over situation in Zamfara, N-Central, says Defence Minister\n\nAlso fielding questions, Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi, retd, expressed government\u2019s concern over the security situation in Zamfara State and the North-Central, and assured of the military\u2019s determination to change the narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe believe that the spate at which these things are happening in Zamfara State and North-Central is a source of concern to the government and to all agencies that are responsible for the execution of operations in the North-Central.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the need for urgency in our dealing with the bandits. We believe they\u2019re becoming a nuisance; killing people, they are doing what they like, they make careless statements, they say what they think they should say in order to solicit the kind of audience they want from the society.\u201d\n\nMagashi said the meeting also appraised developments generally which, according to him, require all hands to be on deck, with a view to halting the menace.\n\n\u201cWe have appraised our position, we\u2019ve found that we are capable, we can do this thing, but we need the cooperation of every Nigerian in order to ensure a free society,\u201d he said.\n\nAssuring of the preparedness of the security forces to end the menace of banditry, among others, in the country, the Minister said: \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to ensure the mission is successful and we\u2019ll do all we can to ensure the completion of this mission, especially when equipment and other things are available to support the course of our tactical manoeuvres and that we\u2019ll do very well from now.\u201d\n\nOn the status of the Super Tocano jets recently procured to enhance military operations in the country, Magashi said: \u201cWe are just testing them, six are still coming maybe next 12 of them are here, I think the Chief of Air Staff will brief you on the operations that they are to undertake as soon as possible.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Babagana Zulum had approved a substantial amount to fast track restocking of the zoo.\n\nHe added that the gesture was aimed at giving a facelift to the zoo which had not been upgraded in decades.\n\nJidiayi said the zoo, established in the seventies lost most of its animals and birds to the outbreak of Rinderpest and bird flu diseases in 1994.\n\nAccording to him, the zoo has in stock 37 species of animals including lions and elephants.\n\nJidiayi said the zoo had taken delivery of some animals including Zebra, Eland, and Warthog, adding that more animals would be received soon.\n\nThe official said the measure would not only revive the zoo culture in the state but reinvigorate the zoo as a conservation area to attract tourists and researchers.\n\n\u201cThe state government is making effort to bring up some of the lost species of animals.\n\n\u201cThe governor has approved funds for the restocking exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Jidiayi, the management of the zoo also has an animal exchange agreement with Audu Bako Zoo in Kano, which is permissible under zoo keeping laws.\n\nHe said that a green area had been created in the zoo to enhance recreational activities and social gatherings.\n\n\u201cGov. Zulum\u2019s administration has increased the standard of the zoo by 80 per cent, the gate fee is N50 per head. Conservation is not supposed to be a revenue generation venture,\u201d Jidiayi said.\n\nOther stakeholders in the North\u2013East have identified lack of maintenance, poor management and political commitment as some of the bane of the zoo culture.\n\nDr Maduabuchi Amobi, lecturer, Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University Kashere, Gombe State, said the lack of maintenance was making the comatose zoos less attractive to visitors.\n\nAmobi said the Kano zoo was one of the best tourist attractions in the past years, lamenting that the trend had changed due to the poor state of the zoo.\n\nHe alleged that most of the personnel managing the zoo and wildlife parks in the country were neither zoologists nor professionals.\n\nThe don added that the trend resulted in a lack of interest in the management of the facilities.\n\n\u201cYou cannot expect somebody without knowledge of zoos or one who is not a professional to manage it effectively.\n\n\u201cUnder such conditions, the animals were not being properly cared for and this makes zoos unattractive to tourists.\n\n\u201cPeople have a preference for the national parks and game reserves as against zoos, so as to see the animals in their natural habitat,\u201d Amobi said.\n\nAccording to him, some of the animal species are smarter in their natural environment and they are affected by anxiety and depression when removed from nature.\n\nThe don said that this brought about the need to know the location and types of animals to keep in a zoo.\n\n\u201cFor instance; flamingoes live in large numbers, therefore you must work on their psychology before you bring them into the zoo else they will not survive,\u201d\n\nAmobi said.\n\nOn his part, Mohammed Nasir-Yusuf, General Manager, Bauchi State Tourism Board, said that poor management and lack of political commitments resulted in the closure of zoos and parks across the country.\n\nNasir-Yusuf identified policy inconsistency and lack of experts as other factors affecting zoo development.\n\nHe also attributed the low patronage of zoos in the country to insecurity and harsh economic conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is no zoo in Bauchi State but the Yankari and Bura-Ningi game reserves as well as Sumu wildlife park, serve as our tourism sites in the state,\u201d Nasir-Yusuf said.\n\nAccording to him, zoos are becoming unpopular in view of the high cost of maintenance, saying that one zebra costs between N3.5 million to N4 million.\n\nAlso, Dr. Murtala Alamai, Head of Department, Leisure and Tourism Management, Federal Polytechnic Bauchi, advocated for the establishment of private zoos and zoological gardens to enhance tourism in the country.\n\nAlamai said that former President Olusegun Obasanjo was the only prominent figure to have established a private mini zoological park at his library in Abeokuta in Ogun.\n\nHe said existing zoological parks were confronted with serious problems preventing their effective growth such as lack of qualified personnel, refresher training programme and encroachment by land developers.\n\n\u201cZoos are on the verge of going extinct due to lack of value attached to their importance. It costs huge human and capital resources to establish and maintain one.\n\n\u201cTo establish a zoo, you need to have an average of 100 staff including vets and other specialised workers.\n\n\u201cA monthly feeding expenditure of animals caged in the zoo and park cost about N1 million depending on the quantity and types of animal species,\u201d Alamai said.\n\nMr Ibrahim Bala, Deputy Chairman, West African Tourism Development Action Group, also commented on the disappearing zoo culture in Nigeria.\n\nBala said that poor orientation, lack of private zoo practitioners and obsolete facilities were some of the bane of zoological parks in the country.\n\nHe said that the lack of access roads to some of the zoos and parks like the Oduduwa Zoo in Oyo and Sumu Park in Bauchi was affecting smooth operations of the facilities.\n\nAlso, Dr. Amos Sunday, a private Veterinary Consultant based in Yola, described the deplorable condition of Yola Zoo as \u201cunfit for humans and animals\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe area did not look like a zoo rather, an empty space with scanty recreational facilities.\n\n\u201cThe only animals in the zoo are three monkeys, an old tortoise and an ostrich, which are under deplorable conditions,\u201d Sunday said.\n\nA zookeeper, who didn\u2019t want his name mentioned, said that the Yola zoo was established in the early eighties under the defunct Gongola State.\n\nHe said the facility had been managed by the state government with no serious attention paid to it over the years.\n\n\u201cPeople used to visit the zoo especially during Sallah and Christmas festivities and, we used the little collections for maintenance of the facility,\u201d the official said.\n\nAccording to him, absence of animals and deplorable conditions are the major factors for the low patronage of the zoo.\n\nTo address the problem, Mr Lucas Nelson, Northeast Zonal Coordinator, Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation, called for the review of extant laws regulating the operations of zoos to accommodate global contemporary changes.\n\nNelson stressed the need for development organisations and philanthropists to make contributions towards zoo development by adopting animals and providing free food to sustain the animals.\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Damaturu in Yobe, have expressed concern over the lack of a zoo and wildlife park in the area.\n\nMr Mohammed Babagana, a conservationist, expressed concern over the lack of a zoo in the state since its creation 30 years ago.\n\nBabagana, who is also the Deputy Provost, College of Agriculture, Gujiba, said that zoos were important for wildlife conservation and aesthetic value for people to appreciate nature.\n\n\u201cThe only zoo that exists near us is the Sanda Kyarimi Zoo in Maiduguri.\n\n\u201cThere were plans to establish a zoo in Damaturu some years back; in fact, land was allocated around the present Yobe State University for the project.\n\n\u201cHowever, the project did not see the light of the day due to lack of political will,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Babagana, it is imperative for the state government to establish a zoo considering its relevance to town planning and wildlife conservation.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative to bring animals, especially endangered species from their wild natural settings to artificial environment for protection,\u201d he said.",

He is a government lawyer. He was very instrumental in stopping Igboho\u2019s extradition the moment he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe also have some challenges with him, but we are hopeful that he will adjust going forward. For instance, after every sitting, he briefs the press first before his clients.

Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",

Let us first prioritise the lives and health of our citizens,\u201d added Uddhav Thackeray, the chief minister of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital.\n\nHe was speaking ahead of the 11-day Hindu Ganesh Chaturthi festival, which starts Friday.\n\nThe last Covid-19 wave overwhelmed India\u2019s hospitals and was known to have killed more than 200,000 people.\n\nIt struck after one of the world\u2019s biggest religious gatherings, the Kumbh Mela, which attracted some 25 million Hindu pilgrims.\n\nThat gathering, large state election rallies and the infectious Delta virus variant \u2014 first detected in India \u2014 were blamed by experts for fuelling the surge.\n\nAuthorities said a recent spike in cases in the southern state of Kerala after the Onam festival in August should be cause for alarm.\n\nBut festive crowds have still packed markets in Maharashtra and other states in recent days, ignoring the warnings.\n\nThe state government will limit the height of effigies of the elephant-headed god Ganesha to reduce the number of devotees carrying them during the festival.\n\nProcessions on the festival\u2019s first and last days will be banned.\n\nRestrictions on movements and activities are expected to be introduced this week as cases rise in another major Maharashtra city, Nagpur.\n\nIn the neighbouring state of Karnataka, a night curfew will remain in place and districts posting higher positive test levels will be banned from holding Ganesh celebrations.\n\nKarnataka health minister, K. Sudhakar, told AFP officials were also concerned the recent resumption of high school classes could increase cases.\n\nViti Kumar, a resident of Lucknow in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, said she feared people would let down their guards during the festivals.\n\n\u201cI cannot take chances with my daughter. I am not sending her to school,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nThe southern state of Tamil Nadu has banned public festival celebrations, while the eastern state of West Bengal was expected to impose curbs on the nine-day Durga Puja in October.\n\nIndia has the world\u2019s second-highest known caseload, with more than 33 million infections, and 441,000 deaths.",

          "text": "Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Tuesday that penalizing abortion is unconstitutional, a major victory for advocates of women\u2019s health and human rights, just as parts of the United States enact tougher laws against the practice.\n\nThe decision in the world\u2019s second-biggest Roman Catholic country means that courts can no longer prosecute abortion cases, and follows the historic legalization of the right in Argentina, which took effect earlier this year.\n\nArturo Zaldivar, president of the Mexican Supreme Court, hailed the decision as \u201ca watershed moment\u201d for all women, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nThe vote by the 10 judges present stemmed from a 2018 case challenging a criminal law on abortion in Coahuila, a northern Mexican state which borders Texas, which has just tightened its laws.\n\nIt also comes as a growing feminist movement has taken to the streets in Mexico to press for change, including calls to end anti-abortion laws on the books in much of the country.\n\nAt a demonstration in Coahuila state capital Saltillo, women wearing green bandanas to symbolize the pro-choice movement embraced and shouted \u201cabortion is no longer a crime!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy that abortion has been decriminalized, and now we want it to be legal,\u201d said 26-year-old Karla Cihuatl, one of the demonstrators, who belongs to the feminist organization Frente Feminista in Saltillo.\n\n\u201cThis step has broken the stigma a little. But I believe that we still have to change the social aspect.\u201d\n\nWith some 100 million Catholics, Mexico is the largest predominantly Catholic country after Brazil. The Catholic Church opposes all forms of abortion procedures.\n\nHundreds of mostly poor Mexican women have been prosecuted for abortion, while at least several dozen remain jailed.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote establishes a mandatory criteria for all judges in the country, making it no longer possible to prosecute any woman who has an abortion without violating the criteria of the court and the constitution, Zaldivar said.\n\nCoahuila\u2019s state government issued a statement saying the ruling would have retroactive effects and that any woman imprisoned for abortion should be released \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nA number of U.S. states have moved to restrict access to abortion, particularly Texas, which last week enacted a sweeping ban on the procedure after the first six weeks of pregnancy when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.\n\nThe Mexican ruling may lead to U.S. women in states such as Texas deciding to travel south of the border to terminate their pregnancies.\n\nIn July, the state of Veracruz became just the fourth of Mexico\u2019s 32 regions to decriminalize abortion.\n\nMexico\u2019s leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has carefully avoided taking a stand on the matter, as he did again on Tuesday morning in the run-up to the ruling.\n\nWhen asked at a news conference for his opinion on abortion, he sidestepped the question, saying it was up to the court.\n\n\u201cDue my presidential office, I can\u2019t expose myself to wear and tear, so I have to look after myself, and this is quite a controversial issue,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his winning 2018 election campaign, he forged an alliance with a small political party founded by Christian conservatives known for their strong opposition to abortion.\n\nBy contrast, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was mayor of Mexico City when the capital legalized abortion in 2007, breaking new ground for the country, celebrated the court ruling on Twitter as a \u201cgreat day for the rights of women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat advances there have been in progressive causes in our country!!!\u201d wrote Ebrard, one of the leading contenders to succeed Lopez Obrador when his six-year term ends in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m really delighted!!\u201d",

          "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians rallied across the country on Tuesday in support of far-right populist President Jair Bolsonaro and his embattled administration, while calling for the removal of Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe demonstrations, encouraged by Bolsonaro who then verbally antagonised the court in speeches at two separate rallies, will likely exacerbate a crisis between the executive and the judiciary that has escalated in recent months.\n\n\u201cEither the head of this power gets in line or this power can suffer what we do not want,\u201d the former army captain said at a demonstration in the capital Brasilia on Tuesday morning, in what was widely considered an unspecified threat against the court.\n\nIn recent months, the Supreme Court has authorised investigations into Bolsonaro and his allies for alleged attacks on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cThey release bandits [from prison] and arrest conservatives,\u201d hospital worker Carlos Alberto Juliao, 45, who attended a pro-Bolsonaro demonstration in Sao Paulo, said of the court.\n\nAmid growing scandals, rising inflation, high unemployment and one of the world\u2019s worst COVID-19 death tolls, Bolsonaro\u2019s approval ratings have sunk to record lows.\n\nElections are scheduled for October next year and opinion polls suggest Bolsonaro would lose by a wide margin against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Worker\u2019s Party if he decides to run.\n\nOther left-leaning or centre-right candidates, such as the former governor of the northeastern state of Ceara, Ciro Gomes, or current Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria, would also beat Bolsonaro in a second-round runoff, polls suggest.\n\nThe far-right leader has however hinted that he will refuse to accept defeat if Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system is not changed for paper ballots, a demand that was recently defeated in Congress.\n\nBolsonaro has insisted \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the electronic system is vulnerable to fraud, a claim rejected by judicial experts and other experts, and which critics say is part of a plan to contest next year\u2019s election results.\n\n\u201cOnly God will take me out of Brasilia,\u201d he told a crowd of 114,000 supporters on Sao Paulo\u2019s Paulista Avenue on Tuesday afternoon, according to local military police estimates.\n\nThe rallies were attended by protesters wearing the canary and green colours of the Brazilian flag, with some carrying banners and placards calling for \u201cmilitary invention with Bolsonaro as president\u201d.\n\nBolsonaro himself is an outspoken advocate of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, during which hundreds of political opponents of the regime were murdered and thousands more tortured.\n\nWith political tensions high in Brazil, fears of violent clashes similar to the riot that broke out at the United States Capitol on January 6 had been mounting in the run-up to the rallies.\n\nIn the end, however, unrest was mostly restricted to some Bolsonaro supporters trying to breach police barricades in the capital Brasilia before being driven back with pepper spray.\n\nTurnout, while not small, also was lower than had been expected in Sao Paulo and Brasilia.\n\nWhile the president may have gained a temporary boost after the demonstrations by re-energising his hardcore supporters, few analysts see his prospects of re-election improving.\n\n\u201cIn the end, what counts is reality. And the reality today is one of inflation, overpriced food and fuel, energy crisis and an increase in the population in poverty and social vulnerability,\u201d said Naue de Azevedo, a political scientist based in the Brazilian capital.",

          "text": "Teenager Leylah Fernandez produced another fearless performance to beat Elina Svitolina and set up a US Open semi-final with Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nCanada\u2019s Fernandez, who turned 19 on Monday, showed all of her devastating power to win a tense tie-break 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in New York.\n\nSvitolina, 26, had overturned a 5-2 deficit in the third but could not stop Fernandez\u2019s thrilling, powerful play.\n\nSecond seed Sabalenka dominated French Open winner Barbora Krejcikova 6-1 6-4.\n\nFernandez has beaten defending champion Naomi Osaka, 2016 winner Angelique Kerber and now Olympic bronze medallist Svitolina in her run to her first major semi-final.\n\nShe has shown remarkable composure in New York, backing up her easy power with a calmness and composure on court.\n\nAs Svitolina sent a return of serve long on match point, Fernandez fell to her knees and teared up as she was given a lengthy ovation by the fans on Arthur Ashe.\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea what I\u2019m feeling right now. I was so nervous throughout the whole match,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was honoured to have a fight with Svitolina. I just told myself to go for every point. I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\nFernandez is the youngest women to reach the US Open singles semi-finals since Maria Sharapova in 2005, getting there a day after her 19th birthday.\n\nThe teenagers have made a breakthrough in this year\u2019s US Open, with 18-year-olds Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alvaraz also reaching the fourth round along with Fernandez.\n\nFernandez has shown them that going one further, no matter the opponent, is possible. She has done it by trusting in her game and her big-hitting weapons, finishing with 42 winners against Svitolina.\n\nAs British tennis player Naomi Broady told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport: \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan. Fernandez has backed it up match after match.\u201d\n\nHer father, who coaches her, is an ex-professional footballer. As a child, Fernandez says she believed she could beat him in games of backyard football \u2013 and it is that self-confidence that has backed up her performances in New York.\n\nShe credited her dad, who is at home with her young sister, with giving her tactical support. Her lively support box is led by her fitness coach Duglas Cordero who constantly asked them to make more noise.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me so many things but today he told me to have fun,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe said fight for every point and to not make the quarter-finals my last match and fight for my dream.\u201d\n\nFernandez started strongly against Svitolina, breaking for a 4-2 lead and smashing winners past her increasingly passive opponent.\n\nAn Olympic bronze medallist in Tokyo, Svitolina was slow to adjust her game, but she mixed defence with offence better in the third to finally break the Fernandez serve.\n\nBut Fernandez simply kept hitting and winning the long rallies, breaking back as Svitolina served for the set at 5-1, and creating four break points in the Ukrainian\u2019s next service game.\n\nThe scream that Svitolina let out when an ace out wide wrapped up the second set showed how frustrated she was, but she made the first dent in the third set.\n\nAgain, Fernandez hit her way out of trouble, choosing her shots carefully and outmanoeuvring Svitolina at the net. Three breaks of serve led to the Canadian serving for the match, but she appeared nervy for the first time, allowing Svitolina an opening.\n\nThe tie-break, however, felt like one-way traffic. Fernandez raced out to a 4-1 lead and the points that went against her were largely of her own making, rather than one last push from Svitolina.\n\nThe Ukrainian fought hard but she could not stem Fernandez\u2019s momentum, with the two sharing a hug and a brief word before Svitolina left the court.\n\nSvitolina is often tipped as a Grand Slam champion in waiting but she has reached just two major semi-finals at the French Open and Flushing Meadows in 2019.\n\nFernandez will now face Sabalenka, who is the highest seed remaining in the women\u2019s draw and has dominated her draw.\n\nThe Belarusian has been a consistently strong performer on the WTA Tour but had struggled at Grand Slams, before finally making her breakthrough at Wimbledon last month where she made the last four.\n\nThe match against Krejcikova, who stormed to her maiden Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros earlier this year, promised much, but the Czech was hampered by either an injury or fatigue.\n\nSabalenka barely had to move out of first gear in the opening set, countering five double faults with 12 winners to sweep past Krejcikova.\n\nAlthough Krejcikova did rally towards the end of the second, Sabalenka was able to serve her way out of trouble, saving five of the six break points she faced to close out the match in one hour 28 minutes.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Katsina Governor Masari Admits Error Negotiating with Bandits, to Ban Open Grazing",
          "text": "Governor of Katsina State in Nigeria\u2019s northwest, Aminu Masari, has said with the benefit of hindsight, his government should never have negotiated with bandits, let alone grant them amnesty. Although Masari said he never regretted his decision at the time, he admitted that information available to him confirmed that engaging the bandits was not the right thing to do.\n\nConsequently, based on current understanding of the situation, the governor said he has set in motion plans to proscribe open grazing of cattle in the state. He said once certain structures were put in place for ranching, nomadic herding would be outlawed in the state.\n\nMasari disclosed these during an interview on a national television station.\n\nHe insisted that open grazing of animals should not be encouraged in any form, adding that the practice is even contrary to Islamic doctrines, which forbid allowing animals into other peoples\u2019 land.\n\nThe governor of the North-west state also identified informants as the greatest challenge to the fight against insecurity in that part of the country.\n\nIn a related development, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday, said President Muhammadu Buhari was worried about the selective abductions and killings in the North-west and North-central zones of the country. Baba said the president had directed all security agencies in the country to ensure immediate end to the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, six additional Tucano fighter jets are expected in the country next week to complement the six already on the ground in the fight against insecurity.\n\nMasari, who had offered marauding gunmen amnesty, after negotiations with them, said looking back in hindsight, he should not have done that.\n\nHe said, \u201cI do not regret it. But the only thing I can say is that with the benefit of hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. We realised: who are you talking with, because they do not have an umbrella.\n\n\u201cThey are not pushing for any ideological view; they are not pushing for any religious view. They are simply bandits, criminals and thieves. Any person in the forest is a potential criminal and should be dealt with as such.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the open grazing controversy, Masari said, \u201cWe intend to ban unnecessary roaming about with cattle. But before we do that, we will make provisions where the animals will stay. I think the situation in the southern part of the country is slightly different from the northern part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the herders are from the northern part of the country. So, for us, we need a law that should be obeyed, not one that will be disregarded. For us to come up with the law we will first of all put some structures on ground, then, we will have the law that can back up the structures so that nobody would roam or move about with cattle.\n\n\u201cEven that is un-Islamic. It says do not have the numbers you cannot feed that you have to stretch over to people\u2019s land or on somebody\u2019s farm. I do not think that it is right. And, certainly, once we put in place ranching for the grazing of all animals, the issue of anybody roaming about will be a past.\u201d\n\nOn the rising incidence of armed criminality in Katsina State, Masari categorically identified majority of those involved in the act as Fulani, saying, \u201cThey are the same people like me; who speak the same language like me; who profess the same religion like me. They are not aliens. So, what we have here on ground is banditry.\n\n\u201cThey are people we know. They are people that had been living with us for 100 of years. They are also people of the Fulani extraction. Majority of those involved in this banditry are Fulani, whether it is palatable or not, but that is the truth.\n\n\u201cI did not say that 100 per cent of them are Fulani, but the majority of them are. They are people who live in the forest and their main occupation is rearing of cattle.\n\n\u201cProbably their fortunes dwindled over time with climate change and their lack of access to education, both Islamic and Western education, also aggravated the situation.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging possible infiltrations from some West and North African countries, the governor stressed that the fall of former Libya leader Muammar Ghadafi had encouraged instability and proliferation of arms and ammunitions. He urged the political leadership in northern Nigeria to summon courage and determination to end the crisis.\n\n\u201cI think it is our responsibility in Katsina and northern Nigeria to be determined to end this,\u201d he said.\n\nMasari added, \u201cThe biggest problem in our efforts and other places is their informants. They are everywhere in the markets and the villages and when they see military or police patrol they will inform.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the support the informants are giving to the bandits, which empowers them with information. Once we are able to cripple the informants, especially, by taking away the networks, the informants can no longer help them. The armed forces have their own way of communicating.\u201d\n\nThe governor explained that the bandits would be fished out and brought to book with the aid of technology and the determination of the armed forces.\n\nHe stated regarding the armed criminal gangs, \u201cThey live in the forests. The terrain is very bad and reaching them is also very difficult. But with the help of technology and what we have seen the air force is trying to do, we will be able to reach some of their camps, get their leaders and bring them to book. The efforts of the military are yielding success in reaching the most difficult areas.\n\n\u201cA lot of these areas are ungoverned, because they are forest areas. Access to them is difficult in rainy season but not impossible. With technology, we will be able to reach wherever they are and fish them out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Baba, who spoke after Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) at State House, Abuja, chaired by Buhari, said the president had directed sustained action to end the menace of selective abduction and killings in the North-central and North-west geopolitical zones.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the close-door meeting, Baba stated, \u201cThe new marching order is that all the service chiefs and intelligence chiefs have been warned to go and reinvigorate efforts and to do more so that the North-central and Nigeria at large should enjoy better security.\u201d\n\nThe IG, who acknowledged government\u2019s responsibility to secure the citizenry, admitted that more needed to be done to change the insecurity narrative pervading the North-central and North-west, as well as other parts of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe president also observed and made a remark that the constitutional responsibility of government is the provision of security, and he is ready to provide such. We should reinvigorate our efforts, which are yielding results in the North-east, South-east.\n\n\u201cBut there is more to be done in the North-central, North-west, where people are worried and he has intelligence and information that schoolchildren and students are abducted, selective abductions and killings are done. This narrative must change.\u201d\n\nThe IG added that the security chiefs had assured the president that they would try their best to improve the security narrative.\n\nBaba said on their meeting with Buhari, \u201cWe have assured him and promised that we will make efforts to do more. He also thanked and praised us for what has been done so far; that we should improve much so that people can go about their lawful businesses within the quickest possible means.\u201d\n\nMinister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), also revealed after the meeting that six more Tucano jets would be in the country by next week to boost the fight against insurgency and other criminalities bedevilling the country. Magashi stressed that the initial six Tucano jets that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of recently were currently being test run while the Chief of Air Staff would soon give further details on the issue.\n\nThe minister told journalists, \u201cWe are just testing the Tucano jets. Six are still coming by the end of, maybe, next week. So, when the 12 of them are here, I think the Chief of Air Staff will brief you on the operations that they are to undertake as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMagashi expressed government\u2019s concern over the unfolding insecurity in Zamfara State and the North-central, but assured the people of military\u2019s determination to change the narrative.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe believe that the rate at which these things are happening in Zamfara State and North-central is a source of concern to the government and to all agencies that are responsible for the execution of the operations in the North-central.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the need for urgency in our dealing with the bandits. We believe they\u2019re becoming a nuisance; killing people, they are doing what they like, they make careless statements, they say what they think they should say in order to solicit the kind of audience they want from the society.\u201d\n\nThe defence minister said the meeting also appraised the developments, generally, which required all hands on deck.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have appraised our position, we\u2019ve found that we are capable, we can do this thing, but we need the cooperation of every Nigerian in order to ensure a free society.\n\n\u201cSecurity, as far as this country is concerned, is the paramount important thing. Without security, nothing will happen and the Commander-in-Chief has emphasised this today that without security, nothing can go on. So, he has directed us to find ways, tactics and style with which we can get out of this and we assured him.\u201d\n\nFurther assuring of the preparedness of the security agencies to end the menace of insecurity in the country, Magashi said, \u201cWe will do our best to ensure the mission is successful and we will do all we can to ensure the completion of this mission, especially, when equipment and other things are available to support the course of our tactical manoeuvres and that we will do very well from now.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",
