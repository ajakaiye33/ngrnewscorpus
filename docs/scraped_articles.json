          "text": "By Dennis Agbo\n\nPursuant to enhancing food security in the country, a Housing and Agricultural development firm, Eastern House Development Ltd, has advised Nigerians to emphasise the establishment of farm estates than Housing.\n\nThe firm said that efforts should move from the construction of houses to farm estates, where available land should be used for agricultural purposes in commercial quantities.\n\nThe firm disclosed that it was ready to partner in the specific development of farm estates for government, groups or individuals interested in the project.\n\nChairman/Group Managing Director of the firm, Mr. Nuel Chinedu while addressing Newsmen in Enugu, urged the Federal and the State Governments, as well as individuals to commence investment in the agricultural sector to create food security and employment.\n\nChinedu\u2019s advice is coming as the country battles the food crisis and worsening challenges in the power sector, with many investors already out of the country, noting that only agriculture would pull the country out of its present woes.\n\n\u201cAgricultural development is essential to any nation\u2019s economic wellbeing. There must be an intensified effort towards ending poverty and ensuring food security, as well as feeding the increasing population figures within the urban and rural communities,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he was already leading efforts to take the country away from building houses to \u201cproviding real estate products solely built for agricultural use.\u201d\n\nWhile calling for collaboration from Enugu State Government, other States, as well as individuals and organizations, he noted that \u201cincreased investor interest suggests that there could be real potential in larger scale commercial investments in the continent.\n\n\u201cThe key question is what type of investments do private developers/investors need to do to significantly grow African agricultural development?\n\n\u201cIt means the development of ultramodern farmlands and farm settlements, poultries, fish farms, cattle ranches, and other agricultural facilities for rearing animals and cultivation of crops in commercial quantities.\n\n\u201cAs in the traditional real estate sector, agricultural real estate will provide homes for rearing animals in a gated distant estate to improve the nation\u2019s agricultural output and boost food security.\n\n\u201cWith widening food insecurity and climate change fatalities on agricultural production, we believe that there is a need to construct extensive farm estates across states, hence the need for creating disruptive real estate style in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe, thereby, make a strong case for mass agricultural real estate construction and seek partners in this regard,\u201d he further stated.",

          "text": "Aig-Imoukhueme,\n\nBy Etim Etim\n\nSustaining public sector effectiveness and enhancing the morale of public servants during economic crisis could be a very daunting task for many leaders in Africa. Faced with competing demands for resources, governments often have to perform a delicate balancing act in resource allocation among the various sectors.\n\nThe dilemma that arises in choosing whether to fund infrastructure and other visible deliverables or allocate resources to public service training is well known to our budget managers in government. But the centrality of public sector workers in the implementation of government policies and programmes is never in doubt. Some Nigerians have also recognized that civil servants must receive the required trainings, exposure, and skills upgrade to operate at optimum level. One of those Nigerians is Aigboje Aig-Imoukhude, who together with his wife, Ofovwe, established a Foundation, which amongst other activities, provides training for senior public servants, preparing them for higher responsibilities.\n\nThe Aig-Imoukhuede Foundation is a public sector-focused philanthropic organisation that seeks to improve the lives of Africans through transformed public-service delivery and improved access to quality primary healthcare. The Foundation\u2019s programmes and initiatives are focused on supporting the development of a more effective public sector. As Mr Aig-Imoukhuede has said, leadership transformation lies at the heart of broader public sector transformation, and so the Foundation is focused on offering programmes that build the capacity of civil servants and other public sector officials. In addition to offering scholarships to public servants to undertake a master\u2019s degree in Public Policy at the University of Oxford, the foundation has created its flagship executive education programme, the AIG Public Leaders Programme (AIG PLP), also delivered in partnership with the University of Oxford, that develops transformative public sector leaders who can drive change in the institutions they lead.\n\nThe AIG PLP is a unique executive programme that affords high-potential Nigerian public servants an opportunity to strengthen the skills they need to build cultures of excellence, effectiveness and integrity throughout the institutions they lead. The programme aims to broaden participant\u2019s public leadership skills and provide them with conceptual and practical tools needed to meet the challenges of leading in the public service in an increasingly complex and changing world.\n\nAfter a rigorous multistage selection process, the inaugural class (Class of 2021) of the programme commenced in September 2021, with 49 participants from across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria, working in different government ministries, departments, and agencies. The programme curriculum is set around six core themes that are mapped out to significantly harness the skills of its participants. They are: Governing in times of challenge and change; Integrity; The pitfalls in decision making; Strengthening organisations; Harnessing technology and Leadership.\n\nAfter completing five weeks of intense classroom work, participants were required to develop projects, ideas or initiatives that would have transformational impact in their workplaces in particular and the public service in general. All the 49 programme participants successfully developed and implemented projects in their institutions, with long ranging implications for improved productivity, effectiveness, and service delivery across the public sector. It is amazing how these ideas and initiatives, developed from what they learned in the classroom, have created so much impacts in the various departments where they work.\n\nEach participant\u2019s project defined the problems in their workplace; the initiative or intervention expected to address the problems; steps taken to tackle the challenges and the results achieved. Take the case of Abdullahi Ali Buhari, a deputy director in the Human Resources Dept of NDIC. After attending the programme, he designed and implemented an automated short message service for employee payroll payment notification. This service enhances effective payroll payment system communication through which employees are advised of their compensation and benefits entitlements at every point of payment before it gets to the bank.\n\nPoor internal communication is a major problem in the public service, and it\u2019s a challenge Ada Phil-Ugochukwu is very familiar with. After attending the course, Ada led a team that designed measures to address systemic weakness in internal communication in her organization. Her initiatives include creation of a shared online corporate activity calendar; distribution of post event communiqu\u00e9 to staff; bi-annual staff pulse check to obtain feedback, etc. To mitigate and overcome bias against management, corporate decisions are made collectively, communicated timely and clearly to the right persons and through the right channels.\n\nImproving technical competencies of his team was Adedayo Adereti\u2019s major goal before he was admitted for the programme. A Chemical Engineer at Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, Adereti returned to Lagos empowered to address his concerns. He conducted capacity needs assessment of his staff and training opportunities were identified. He also collaborated with the Ministry of Establishment & Training and relevant training organizations to generate adequate funding for his team.\n\nOther impactful ideas generated by the participants centred on improving work habits of public servants through extrinsic and intrinsic motivation; unsuitable manual filing of accounts; improving organizational effectiveness through digitization and application of auditable performance appraisal system to enhance workplace productivity. I am particularly fascinated by Chinenye Ekwealor\u2019s initiative on Improvement of evidence-based decision-making through implementation of an improved KPI monitoring process at her department at the NAFDAC. Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) in her department was inefficient because it only monitored a portion of the laboratory\u2019s overall testing process.\n\nFurthermore, heads of various lab units confirmed their inability to use the KPI monitoring procedure to accurately assess their units\u2019 overall performance. But Chinenye was able to apply the theory she learned at the AIG PL Programme to improve the laboratory\u2019s KPI monitoring, reporting and review process through the development of a new protocol and KPI dashboard, allowing for a faster, visual and more accurate assessment of the lab\u2019s performance against specified performance targets.\n\nClearly, the impacts of the various projects undertaken by these 49 participants of the programme have been felt at the various organizations they work for. The compound benefits of the programme will come over time as more and more civil servants pass through the programme. The graduates are returning to their work with enhanced problem-solving skills and job satisfaction and improved self esteem that comes with it. My expectation is that with consistent implementation of this programme over the next several years, a critical mass of public service icons would have emerged to drive the change we all need. I should also suggest that this programme be extended to our politicians, especially those who are occupying leadership positions. Most of them just don\u2019t have the requisite exposure and skills for the positions they occupy.\n\nThe Foundation is currently receiving applications for the next cycle and will welcome applications from public servants across the different African countries who want to strengthen the skills they require to be effective in their roles and to enhance their career.\n\nEtim, a journalist and retired banker, lives in Abuja",

          "text": "Dr. Ese Owie\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senatorial Aspirant in Edo South Senatorial District and Former Executive Chairman of Edo State Internal Revenue Service, Dr. Ese Owie, has commenced consultations with leaders and delegates of the Party across the 7 Local Government Areas that make up the Senatorial District, with a view to securing their support ahead of the primaries slated for May 2022.\n\nOwie began the tour on Wednesday with a visit to the Party\u2019s leadership in Oredo Local Government Area where his team was hosted by the Chairman and Members of the LGA Executive, 12 Ward Chairmen, Women Leaders, Youth Leaders, and other leaders from across the local government.\n\nSpeaking at the expanded leadership meeting which had over 50 statutory delegates in attendance, Dr. Owie stated that his decision to kickstart the LGA consultations from Oredo is because Oredo remains the epicenter of Edo South and ancestral home of the Benin Nation.\n\n\u201cAs the capital of Edo State and the political headquarters of Edo South Senatorial District, it is absolutely proper to commence our engagement with the leadership of our great party at the LGA level in Oredo, the land of our forbears and capital of the Great Benin Empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank all the leaders gathered here today for finding time to converge on this historic venue in Ogbe Quarters to share ideas on the most efficient ways of leapfrogging Edo South into its next developmental epoch.\u201d Owie stated.\n\n\u201cIn line with our legislative agenda, we shall, by the Grace of the Almighty, channel our efforts on 5 Thematic Pillars, around which we intend to focus our developmental interventions.'\u201d\n\n\u201cAs stated during our engagement with the leadership of the Senatorial Caucus a few days ago, these pillars are Education, Infrastructure, Health, Agriculture and Wealth Creation'\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the peculiarity of Oredo as the spiritual and cultural home of the Benin Kingdom, developing its infrastructure remains a key priority of all tiers of Government. To that extent, therefore, we shall ensure that the Federal Government prioritises the completion of Phase 2 of the Benin By-Pass which runs from Sapele Road back to Oluku, so as to open up the outskirts of the city, and ease traffic flow\u201d, Owie added.\n\n\u2018We shall use the instrumentality of legislative oversight to ensure that the NNPC\u2019s exploration and production arm \u2013 the NPDC \u2013 fulfils its host community obligations to Oredo LGA and the wider Edo South.\u201d\n\nIn the Agriculture sector, beyond optimizing the operations of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN), Iyanomo and the Benin Owena River Basin Development Authority, BORBDA, we shall facilitate the establishment of Produce Grading Centres in Edo South. This will stem the trend of taking produce outside for grading; and our local farmers can have their produce graded and the production volume tracked for produce aggregation, while simultaneously ramping up processing capabilities.\u201d We shall also engage the Federal Department of Agriculture to ensure that subsidized farm inputs including improved planting materials and fertilizers are accessible to our local farmers.\n\nResponding, the Chairman of the PDP in Oredo, Prince Oduwa Igbinosun thanked Dr. Owie for his visit and assured him of their support. Other leaders present at the event include Leader of Oredo PDP, Hon. Martin Osakue, Senatorial Woman Leader (Edo South) Mrs West Irabor, amongst other dignitaries.\n\nSimilarly, in Iguobazuwa, headquarters of Ovia South West LGA, Dr. Owie was received by the PDP Leadership led by the Chairman Hon Felix Onaiwu. Also present were Hon Monday Ihama, Chief Oliha, Kemi Aimufua, All 10 Ward Chairmen, Youth Leaders, Women Leaders and critical stakeholders from across the LGA.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, Owie, again shared his legislative agenda for Edo South and emphasized the imperative of developing the local government by escalating the deplorable state of infrastructure, especially in the coastal, oil producing areas, in Siluko, Ofunama, and Okomu.\n\nDecrying the poverty and squalor in those communities, Owie insisted that the NPDC, Oil Majors, and the NDDC shall be engaged to fulfill their obligations to the indigenes of these communities so as to engender sustainable development.\n\nAssuring the delegates of his commitment to vigorously tackle the problem of erosion, Owie promised to ensure that the Ecological Funds Office priortizes the implementation of the Udo and Usen Flood and Erosion Control programmes, amongst other projects.\n\nAt both Local Government Areas, Owie met with over 100 Statutory delegates who assured him of their support and prayed the Lord to grant him victory at the primaries",

          "title": "Again, Umahi attacks Wike for mocking him on national television",
          "text": "Embattled Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has stated that the judgement by Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, who ordered him and his deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe, to vacate their offices for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) poses no threat to his presidential ambition.\n\nUmahi, who met with President Muhammadu Buhari along with his colleagues from the APC in respect of the March 26 convention, described the judgement as a blessing in disguise, stressing that a counter pronouncement by a Federal High Court in Abuja, has affirmed that he enjoys immunity as an elected governor, and that votes secured during an election legally belongs to the candidate and not a political party.\n\nUmahi, while referring to the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, but failed to mention his name, lauded him for admitting on national television that he was behind the hatchet job.\n\nTaking a swipe on Wike, the Ebonyi state governor likened him (Wike) to biblical Judas Iscariot, noting that as a man who relies on the breath of God like any other mortal, he cannot determine his fate.\n\nAccording to him, he serves only the living God while that of his unnamed counterpart, might be based on alcohol.\n\nAsked if he was perturbed about the court judgement, Umahi said: \u201cDo I look worried? You see, God has plans for everything. And I think that God allowed one court to give judgment that I go nowhere, allowed another court to say, because we defected, that the votes belong to the party.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m very worried because the highest court has said that votes belong to the candidates. And that\u2019s why even though APC won the election in Bayelsa State, but the deputy governors credentials, were defective.\n\n\u201cAnd even a day to swearing in, the Supreme Court ruled disqualifying the candidate of APC that won the election because of his deputy. And so if votes belonged to the party, it would have been that the Supreme Court in its wisdom would have just asked for the man that won election for the party to bring the substitutes to do that.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not worried. Because in the first place, there is no constitutional provision that says that the governor can be sued in the first place, so I\u2019m not sue-able. You know, but a court judgment is a court judgment, I\u2019m not in the position to interpret it but the Constitution, we swore to uphold, I can speak to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAnd the Constitution says that, once you\u2019re elected, you enjoy immunity, and Supreme Court says votes cast in an election belong to the candidate. And that\u2019s why you have qualifications of a candidate and not qualifications of a political party. So I\u2019m not worried.\n\n\u201cBut you see, God allowed it so that where I couldn\u2019t reach in terms of my consultation, this situation has made it possible for me to reach those places. And to truly see that Nigerians love me and they want me and that is the reason for that.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to thank the PDP and even the man that boosted that he did that hatchet job. If the people that crucify Christ knew that it will bring salvation to the whole world, they wouldn\u2019t have done that. So the hatchet man that boasted is liken to Judas Iscariot. And so I have no worry because the Constitution is clear. I have confidence in the judiciary and so you can see I have added some weight in these few days and looking more handsome.\u201d\n\nAsked if he and his unnamed counterpart had personal grouse aside the politics of decamping to APC, he said: \u201cProbably the difference between us will be our faith. I serve the living God and he probably a lot of alcohol. I don\u2019t drink. So that is the differences between us otherwise he remains my friend and my brother and I have nothing against him.\u201d\n\nWhen pressured to name the governor he was referring to, Umahi said: \u201cYou should be the one telling me. You heard him on Channels boasting that he is behind. A mere man that depends on the breath of God. I pity illiteracy. It\u2019s a shame. You are boosting to remove another governor.\n\n\u201cWhat qualifies you just because you\u2019re packing money that is public fund? Not intellectual material but by just packing money from public funds and you are boasting about it. Otherwise, who were you?\n\n\u201cI became a billionaire at the age of 25. I\u2019ve worked all my life and I have asked him to come for public debates.\n\n\u201cI do not commission 3.4 kilometer road. I commission 35 kilometer roads. I commissioned twin flyovers running to one kilometer. I commission mega projects with little resources.\n\n\u201cSo, if he says he has done well and he is Mr this or that, let him come for public debate with me. Let\u2019s start with our childhoods. So I\u2019m not disturbed.\u201d\n\nAsked whether his presidential ambition has died he said: \u201cIt could be just your own imagination because there is no such thing. You can see us in the various media houses, you know, social media. You can see my supporters everywhere, you can see my consultation.",

The monarch occupies prominent place in the history of Yoruba land. As such the burial of any Olubadan as a prominent monarch in Yoruba land should be more traditional than religious.\n\n\u201cThis is the truth because the myth and respect that are attached to every Yoruba Obas across the southwest is legendary. Traditional rites is the soul of every traditional institution. Once it is removed, the institution remains empty and lacks the true respect.\n\n\u201cWhat this implies is that even if an Olubadan subscribes to a religion, it does not matter when it comes to the issues of rites of passage or the core tradition.\n\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, Yoruba traditional rites is sacred and unique. It is what really defines our core values as a race.\n\n\u201cSo, I am appealing to Kabiesi to look into this obvious lapses and find a way of restoring the values and glories of the traditional institution in Ibadan land.

          "text": "The United States has accused Russian forces of war crimes.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken made the allegation in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin \u201chas unleashed unrelenting violence that has caused death and destruction across Ukraine\u201d.\n\nBlinken quoted reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians. \u201cRussia\u2019s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Many of the sites Russia\u2019s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians. This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital, as the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressly noted in a March 11 report. It also includes a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word \u201c\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438\u201d \u2014 Russian for \u201cchildren\u201d \u2014 in huge letters visible from the sky. Putin\u2019s forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people. Their attempt to do so in Ukraine has again shocked the world and, as President Zelenskyy has soberly attested, \u201cbathed the people of Ukraine in blood and tears.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day that Russia\u2019s forces continue their brutal attacks, the number of innocent civilians killed and wounded, including women and children, climbs. As of March 22, officials in besieged Mariupol said that more than 2,400 civilians had been killed in that city alone. Not including the Mariupol devastation, the United Nations has officially confirmed more than 2,500 civilian casualties, including dead and wounded, and emphasizes the actual toll is likely higher,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken added that the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime.\n\nHe said the Department of State and other U.S. government experts were documenting and assessing potential war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia\u2019s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOur assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources. As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases.

Each car also comes with a panic button to be used in case of assault or emergency. The panic button is also on mobile application and is connected to the Control and Command Centre.\n\nSanwo-Olu also hinted the automobile assembly plant being set up in Lagos \u2013 another component of the partnership with CIG Motors, is 60 per cent completed, with an anticipated launch and start of operations expected in September.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing today is that Lagos is moving away from the era of rickety kabu kabu to brand-new, comfortable and safe transport system.\n\n\u2018The multiplier effect of this initiative on job creation, youth employment and economic growth and development in the state cannot be overstated,\u201d he stated.\n\nCommissioner for Transportation Frederic Oladeinde described the scheme as \u2018another milestone achievement\u2019 by the government.\n\nHe noted that the initiative has joined an array of other innovative solutions initiated in the transport sector which are targeted at redefining public transportation.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nAs of press time Wednesday, firefighters were still battling to quell the fire because they could not access its source under the bridge. They thus resorted to working from the top of the bridge.\n\nHeads of Ministries, Agencies and Parastatals (MDAs) of the Federal and Lagos State government addressed reporters on top of the bridge when they visited to assess the situation.\n\nThe Director of Highways, Bridges and Design in the Federal Ministry of Works, Oluropo Oyetade, who represented the minister, said: \u201cAll occupants under our bridges, particularly in Lagos now, have seven days, starting today, to leave. By March 31, the task force will begin to forcefully evict recalcitrant persons. Such persons would also pay to remove their goods.\n\n\u2018By March 31, we will start cleaning up our bridges because if there were no illegal occupants of the space under this bridge, this fire would have been contained. The Eko Bridge has just been awarded for repairs, the contractor has not started work yet and now this has happened. Government cannot keep committing huge resources to maintain infrastructure while some unscrupulous elements will continue to draw us back by damaging them.\n\n\u2018The enforcement order will also be extended to other states after now because we can\u2019t continue to record such cases.\u2019\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

He reiterated that the bridge was a federal one, but the state maintains it and would partner it on whatever must be done.\n\n\u2018The fire started from under the bridge and though it\u2019s not as serious as before, it has not been quelled because it\u2019s been difficult for the firefighters to get under the bridge because of illegal encroachment by containers and various activities going on there. They have no access to the source.\n\n\u2018We have done our best to contain the fire, and the firefighters will remain here to keep the fire under check so it doesn\u2019t extend beyond control.\u2019\n\nSpecial Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye, described the situation as sad.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a sad day for us but this was clearly avoidable. We have said many times that the bridges are not places you store explosives and chemicals. People who live under the bridges don\u2019t even know this. There are many containers here and we don\u2019t know who is who, and this has compounded the fire because it\u2019s difficult to contain it due to lack of accessibility. Even the water trucks cannot get close enough because everywhere is clogged. It looks like we brought this upon ourselves. We heaped this upon ourselves.\u2019\n\nDirector of Lagos Fire and Rescue Service Margaret Adeseye promised that the agency will ensure the fire is extinguished before leaving the site. She however urged the public to take fire safety seriously.\n\n\u2018We need to be fire conscious, the best fire fought is the one prevented. Let us prevent fire everywhere we find ourselves and obey rules regarding that,\u2019 Adeseye said.",

But where people still choose to go against the grain, whatever the party constitution allows them, because we wouldn\u2019t do anything undemocratic.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u2018Mr President has always urged consensus for all positions because consensus is in accordance with the democratic tenets and once you have leaders who are established, who are working towards the same goal, yes, we might have our individual differences, like was once carefully explained by Governor El-Rufa\u2019i, but on the principle of ensuring that we get leadership that will hit the ground running, we are united, and to that extent, we will support any process that will lead to consensus and the emergence of leaders without the need for an election.\u2019\n\nOn if there is likely going to be surprises at the convention, the chairman of PGF said: \u2018No, the governors are united. The governors are unanimous in support of Mr President. The governors are unanimous in the support of the caretaker committee, we thank the Caretaker Committee for what they have been doing.\n\n\u2018Naturally, there will be hiccups one day, but we have overcome them and we are a human organization, which is bound sometimes to generate emotions and anxiety, but we are united and unanimous and by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019ll have a very successful and peaceful National Convention.\u2019\n\nEarlier, Bagudu said the forum briefed President Buhari on what the governors have been doing in support of the March 26 National Convention, which is coming up in a few days.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u2018We restated our commitment to our unity and support for Mr President to acknowledge the progress made under the APC.\u201d\n\nOn Buhari\u2019s letter to him as chairman of PGF and the series of actions that followed, Bagudu said it led to their recommitment to ensure the party succeeds.\n\n\u2018Some of you may recall that last week there was a letter that was widely circulated in the media, addressed to me as the Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and copied to a number of others, including the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, the acting Chairman of the Caretaker Committee and indeed the Secretary to the Government of the Federation,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018That letter led to a series of actions, including meetings between the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee, Acting Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State, as he was then, and myself.\n\n\u2018We all restated our commitment to working together to ensure that the convention takes place on March 26, 2022, and then we agreed to support all the decisions that were taken by the Caretaker Committee, both acting as a working committee and acting with the donated powers given to it by the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u2018Indeed, the Chairman of the Caretaker, upon his return, also appreciated what the Caretaker Committee did and the decisions that were taken in his absence.\n\n\u2018Today we all briefed Mr President on that, of course, included on that is the issue of distributing political party offices to the respective zones and our support for Mr President\u2019s endorsement of the candidate for the National Chairman of the party and the various geo-political zones took turns to brief Mr President, on what they have been doing to generate consensus in their respective zones amongst the National Working Committee and zonal party positions that have been either allocated to the zones or which the zones are entitled to.\n\n\u2018Most of the zones have been allocated National Working Committee positions that are fewer than the number of states, but however, there are zonal executive committees from which the zones are working to produce a consensus list.\n\n\u2018So, this afternoon, the respective zones; Governor Abu Bello on behalf of the North-Central; His Excellency, Governor Babagana Zulum Umara, on behalf of the Northeast; His Excellency, Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State on behalf of Northwest; His Excellency, Governor Dave Umahi, on behalf of Southeast. Governor Kayode Fayemi briefed the President on the South West. I further mention the position of the South-South to Mr President, as I had on paper.\n\n\u2018So, Mr President appreciated the briefing and restated his gratitude for the work the governors have been doing in support for them in support of the party and preparation for the National Convention.\u2019\n\nIn attendance were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and 16 governors of Kebbi, Plateau, Kogi, Yobe, Ogun, Kaduna, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Imo, Niger, Jigawa, Kwara, Zamfara, Nasarawa, Borno, and Osun States.",

          "title": "Just In: PDP Govs Meet in Abia, Say APC Unfit to Contest 2023 General Election",
          "text": "Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo\n\nThe governors under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) have declared the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) unfit to participate in the 2023 general elction, saying that the ruling party has become \u201cuncaring and a menace to Nigerians\u201d.\n\nThe opposition governors under te aegis of PDP Governors Forum passed the damning verdict on the APC led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari at its regular meeting held on Wednesday at the Umuobiakwa country home of its Vice-chairman and Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu with 12 governors and a deputy governor in attendance.\n\nAccording to the Forum, it was a surprise that \u201cin the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023\u201d.\n\nShould APC insist on contesting the forthcoming general election despite it woeful failure in every aspects of national life, the PDP Governors said that Nigerians should outrightly reject the ruling party at the polls.\n\n\u201cThe Forum urges Nigerians to reject the APC, a party run undemocratically by a Committee contrary to the Constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates. It is impossible for a party so disorganized to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn a nine-point communique read by the chairman of the Forum and Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, the go enjoys lamented \u201cexcruciating hardships and suffering being meted out to Nigerians by a failed APC led Federal Government\u201d, which is enough reason for Nigerians to reject the party.\n\nThey also stated that APC is no longer viable as a political party and is \u201cat the point of near collapse\u201d, adding that Nigerians should hinge their hope on \u201cthe readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation\u201d.\n\nWe lament the terrible pain and hardship facing Nigerians in virtually all aspects of life. The meeting noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC,\u201d the PDP Governors said.\n\nUsing comparative indicators \u201cobtained mainly\u201d from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBC), the PDP Governors said that\n\ndiesel which is critical for running of SMEs was N131.47 in 2015, but it now costs above N700.\n\n\u201cFuel: Official and Black-Market was N87/155 in 2015, it now costs N167/350.\n\nAviation Fuel/Air Ticket Rate on Domestic Flights was N110 per Litre/N18,000 in 2015, it now hovers around N700 per Litre/N70,000, where available.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the scarcity of fuel which has resulted in loss of several man hours is a disgrace to Nigeria,\u201d the Governors said, adding that \u201cthe collapse of the National Grid (126 times in 7 years \u2013 (June 2015 to March 2022) and its consequences of non-availability of power is most unfortunate\u201d.\n\n\u201cKerosene (NHK) used by the ordinary Nigerian for cooking and power was N180 in 2015, it now sells at \u20a6450.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \u2013 12.5kg Cylinder sold for N2,400 in 2015, is now sold at between N8,750 and N10, 000\u2033.\n\nThe main opposition party governors noted that Nigerians now find it extremely difficult to put bread on their tables as \u201cprices of basic food stuffs are now three times higher than what they used to be in 2015\u201d.\n\n\u201cStaple foods such as rice, beans, cassava flakes are now slipping out of the hands of average Nigerians. Indeed, a Bag of Rice sold for N8500 in 2015 is now N39,000\u201d while electricity was N14.23 per kilowatt in 2015, but is now N38.530, and not even available.\n\n\u201cUnemployment rate was 11.4% in 2015, it is now over 33%, one the highest in the world.\n\nThe poverty rate in 2015 was 11.3% but now about 42.8%.\n\nAccumulated Inflation in 2015 was about 4%, it is now 15.50%; Inflation Rate was 9.01% in 2015 and now 15.7%.\n\nPerhaps the Exchange Rate has been one of the most disastrous. N150 to a dollar was the parallel market (patronised by most businessmen and Nigerians) rate in 2015, it is now about N580 to $1 in the parrel market and still rising.\n\nOn Debt and Debt Servicing, the Forum said:\n\n\u201cDomestic Debt of N8.4T and External Debt of USD 7.3bn was incurred between 1999-2015.\n\nWhile Domestic Debt of N7.63T (June 2015-Dec 2020) and USD28.57bn as at Dec 2020 was incurred. External debt of USD21.27bn was incurred between June 2015 and 2021.\n\nNational Debt to GDP Ratio was 23.41% (2016) it is now 36.88% (2022)\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Corruption Index has risen from 136 in 2015 to 150 now. Nigeria\u2019s Misery Index, an indicator used in determining how economically well off the citizens of a country are, is usually calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the annual inflation rate, has moved from 14.75 percent in 2015 to 50.48 (2021).\n\n\u201cThe major threat to the agricultural sector and food security in Nigeria is insecurity. In the northeast of Nigeria, it is estimated that no fewer than 70,000 hectares of arable farmland have been abandoned in the affected States and Local Government areas. The trend is the same all over the country. This further contributes to food inflation. The APC led Federal Government must take steps to cooperate with States to bring security down to the grassroots.\n\nOn the economic front, the Forum took a swipe at the ruling party, expressing \u201cconcern and alarm over various reports and claims of incidents of stealing of crude oil ranging from 80% to 95% of production made by industry practitioners and called on the Federal Government to set up an appropriate mechanism to reverse this trend and bring perpetrators to account.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors once again decried the inability of the NNPC to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, inspite of Oil selling at above $110. It is patently unconstitutional for NNPC to determine at its whim and discretion when and what to pay to the Federation Account, as it is a mere trustee of the funds for the three tiers of Government: Federal, States and Local Governments. We once again, call for investigations and audit of the quantity of consumption of fuel ascribed to Nigerians and for deployment of technology at the filling stations to determine in a transparent manner the volume of consumption.\n\n\u201cThe Governors would resist any further attempt by NNPC to ascribe unsubstantiated subsidy claims to other tiers of government.\u201d\n\nOther PDP Governors that attended the meeting include, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri \u2013 Adamawa State; Udom Emmanuel \u2013 Akwa Ibom State; Bala Mohammed -Bauchi State; Sen. Douye Diri \u2013 Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom \u2014 Benue State;\n\nDr. Ifeanyi Okowa \u2013 Delta State; Godwin Obaseki \u2013 Edo State; Gov Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi \u2013 Enugu State;\n\nEngr. Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde \u2013 Oyo State;\n\nNyesom Wike \u2013 Rivers State; and\n\nHon Haruna Manu, Deputy Governor \u2013 Taraba State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A resolution has been reached by the lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives to appeal a judgement which directed the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to delete Section 84 (12) of the newly signed Electoral Act.\n\nThe decision was made following a deliberation on the court order during Wednesday\u2019s plenary in both chambers of the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had objected to the provisions of Section 84 (12), which read, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nThe President believes the section constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at conventions or congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election.\n\nHe later asked the National Assembly to amend the section of the Act, but the request was rejected by the lawmakers.\n\nOn Friday last week, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State ordered the AGF to delete the section from the Act.\n\nShe held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and could not stand, saying it was in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, during the Wednesday\u2019s plenary, Senator George Sekibo and scores of other senators at the Senate sponsored a motion on the urgent need to appeal the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umuahia on the suit on the controversial section of the Act.\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi who seconded the motion described the move as a timely intervention, saying its content was straightforward.\n\nSenator Gabriel Suswam, who also supported the motion, believes time is of the essence and the motion is straightforward for the appropriate channel to appeal.\n\n\u201cIn making an appeal, we do not necessarily need the guidance of the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should just go ahead and pass this motion as presented.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers, in their resolution, agreed to appeal the judgement in suit marked FHC/MU/SC/26/2022 to set aside the decision of the court.\n\nFor members in the lower chamber, the clause in question is directed at political appointees and not civil servants.\n\nThey insisted that the court passed a judgement on a matter which was not included in the Electoral Act passed by the National Assembly.\n\nThey also questioned why the National Assembly was not joined as a respondent to the suit, stressing that the action of the judge was an \u2018aberration\u2019.\n\nWhile the lawmakers hinted at writing a petition to the National Judicial Council (NJC), the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, said he would not allow the National Assembly to be ridiculed.\n\nJust like his colleagues, he queried why the judgement was obtained in faraway Abia State, insisting that only the National Assembly had the constitutional authority to alter any part of the legislation which it passed.\n\nGbajabiamila, therefore, appealed to the AGF not to hastily implement the court judgement, and not to get into the legitimate functions of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Scientists in the United States (US) say they have developed a non-hormonal contraceptive pill for males.\n\nThe researchers from the University of Minnesota presented the results of their trial on Wednesday at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).\n\nThere are currently two effective birth control options for men \u2014 condoms and vasectomy.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on the pill, Gunda Georg, head of the medicinal chemistry department at the university, said testing of the pill \u2014 YCT529 \u2014 which was found to be \u201c99 percent effective in mice\u201d, will be used in human clinical trials to begin in the third or fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause it can be difficult to predict if a compound that looks good in animal studies will also pan out in human trials, we\u2019re currently exploring other compounds as well,\u201d Georg said.\n\nA statement by the ACS also noted that the pill, which limits chances of impregnating females, loses effect when no longer taken.\n\n\u201cTo develop their non-hormonal male contraceptive, the researchers targeted a protein called the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-\u03b1). This protein is one of a family of three nuclear receptors that bind retinoic acid, a form of vitamin A that plays important roles in cell growth, differentiation (including sperm formation) and embryonic development,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKnocking out the RAR-\u03b1 gene in male mice makes them sterile, without any obvious side effects. Other scientists have developed an oral compound that inhibits all three members of the RAR family (RAR-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3) and causes reversible sterility in male mice, but Georg\u2019s team and their reproductive biology collaborators wanted to find a drug that was specific for RAR-\u03b1 and therefore less likely to cause side effects.\n\n\u201cSo the researchers closely examined crystal structures of RAR-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 bound to retinoic acid, identifying structural differences in the ways the three receptors bind to their common ligand.\n\n\u201cWith this information, they designed and synthesized approximately 100 compounds and evaluated their ability to selectively inhibit RAR-\u03b1 in cells. They identified a compound, which was named YCT529, that inhibited RAR-\u03b1 almost 500 times more potently than it did RAR-\u03b2 and -\u03b3.\n\n\u201cWhen given orally to male mice for 4 weeks, YCT529 dramatically reduced sperm counts and was 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, without any observable side effects. The mice could father pups again 4-6 weeks after they stopped receiving the compound.\u201d",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support Big Cabal Media at a pivotal moment. Independent tech media like BCM are key pillars of society,\u201d said Abdul Noormohamed, Vice-president Africa at Luminate. \u201cAt Luminate, we are convinced that these digital media disruptors will continue to create engaging content and thereby contribute to the political and societal change we all want to see.\u201d\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, March 9, 2022, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order on cryptocurrencies to address the risks and harness the opportunities digital currencies offer. Less than a week later, Ukraine, a European country currently at war with neighbouring Russia, legalised cryptocurrencies after raising more than $54 million in crypto donations.\n\nWith the war leaving the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to a crash and its financial system less than fully operational, the Eastern European country sought donations from individuals and institutions worldwide. And in less than a week, it received more than $54 million in crypto; this was only possible because cryptocurrencies cross borders easily.\n\nHowever, Russia can also get an edge in the ongoing war with cryptocurrencies. Experts like Morris Ebieroma, Quidax Co-founder, believe that Russia might also take to cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions by the US and European Union (EU).\n\nIn contrast, Binance Founder, Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, in an interview with The Guardian, said, \u201ccrypto is too small for Russia\u201d and is not an alternative. As one of the largest economies in the world, Russia\u2019s transactions on the blockchain would be massive and easily traceable with blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further said that \u201cless than 0.3% of the global net worth today is in crypto, and this percentage applies equally to Russia.\u201d\n\nThe US creates crypto regulation plans while Ukraine legalises crypto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President, Joe Biden. Source: NextAdvisor\n\nTime will tell if Russia will resort to crypto, but the US is currently seeking to understand digital currencies better, as it plans to stay ahead of other nations in harnessing any opportunities they offer.\n\nThe fact sheet released by the White House on Wednesday, March 9, 2022, contains details of what the executive order hopes to accomplish with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe priority is protecting US investors, businesses, and consumers of digital currencies. It directed the Department of Treasury to develop policy recommendations that \u201caddress the implications of the growing digital asset sector and changes in financial markets.\u201d\n\nThe call for protection can be attributed to the number of crypto-related crimes that have seen unsuspecting investors and businesses lose large sums of money. An example is the Bitfinex hack that led to the loss of $3.6 billion in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies have gained a rep for being used for illegal activities, the US admits that it has experienced \u201cexplosive growth in recent years, surpassing a $3 trillion market cap last November and up from $14 billion just five years prior.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also expressed its desire to remain the leader in the global financial system. According to the factsheet, \u201cThe United States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers, businesses, and the broader financial system.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways the US plans to keep an eye on the global financial market is to explore a US Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). It will place urgency on the research and development of a US CBDC to lead the promotion of CBDCs globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the US is still working on figuring out the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, Ukraine has legalised them, becoming the second country in the world after El Salvador to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCivilian and soldiers taking cover. Souce: Aljazeera.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 16, 2022, Cointelegraph reported that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill to legalise cryptocurrencies and create a framework for their regulation.\n\nGoing by El Salvador\u2019s move to make cryptocurrencies a legal tender, Ukraine\u2019s crypto legalisation might not affect the crypto market.\n\nIn terms of economic effects, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged El Salvador to reverse its decision on making crypto a legal tender. According to CoinDesk, the likelihood of El Salvador defaulting on its debt payment has increased by four times since it legalised Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, given how cryptocurrencies have been instrumental to the Russia-Ukraine war, helping the country raise $54 million in donations, legalising crypto could play out differently than it did in El Salvador.\n\nWhat this means for crypto and the decentralised finance system\n\nFinancial commentator and YouTuber, Andrei Jikh, believes the executive order will be a good thing for the cryptocurrency market. He thinks the executive order will improve cryptocurrency regulations and stabilise the market.\n\nCiting the existence of 18,356 cryptocurrencies, he pointed out that it is easy for anyone to create a digital currency, increasing the frequency of crypto-related scams.\n\nJikh believes that regulation could also make integrating crypto with traditional finance seamless. He added that proper regulation could decide if Bitcoin will reach the $100,000 mark.\n\nAmerican diplomat and technologist, Tomicah Tillemann also revealed that the executive order could be a turning point for crypto and the entire Web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe Web3 ecosystem goes beyond finance; it is an ecosystem that is growing to change how the Internet works, turning it into a decentralised World Wide Web that gives ownership and control to users.\n\nTillemann said in a blog post that \u201cWeb3 represents a more efficient, accountable alternative to broken legacy systems.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIf you\u2019re an African football fan, you\u2019re probably aware that the international break will bring us the latest instalment of one of Africa\u2019s biggest football rivalries. If you\u2019re still lost, I\u2019m referring to the World Cup qualifiers between Ghana and Nigeria on March 25 and 29, 2022. The first leg takes place in Kumasi, Ghana, with the second leg in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nThe Nigerian tech space was abuzz on Monday, March 21, 2022, following the report on Bento\u2019s work culture. For over seven hours, thousands of Nigerians shared their experiences of toxic work environments.\n\nHowever, after the outrage has died down, what can be done to ensure employees have a conducive environment to work in? We discussed that and more on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Do listen and share with your friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn today\u2019s email:\n\nThriveAgric\u2019s debt funding\n\nFaster Internet for Oyo residents\n\nLessons from Egypt\n\nThriveAgric\u2019s debt funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY Combinator-backed ThriveAgric has raised $56.4 million in debt funding from institutional investors and local commercial banks. The raise also includes a grant of $1.75 million from the USAID-funded West Africa Trade & Investment Hub.\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric provides farmers with financing, access to premium markets, and tech-enabled solutions for their farms. At first, the startup used a crowdfunding model to raise capital which it deployed to the farmers.\n\nHowever, following disruptions to its supply chain by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup faced difficulties repaying its users and received backlash from angry users.\n\nConsequently, it moved away from its crowdfunding model to raise capital from institutional investors. About the same time, its Co-founder, Uka Eje, had to step down from his role as CEO temporarily, and Adia Sowho was brought in to steady the ship. Those decisions seem to have paid off, with the startup finally paying off its debt to investors in 2021.\n\nWith this raise, the startup intends to expand its operations to other African countries, starting with Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia. It also wants to add to its database of over 200,000 farmers.\n\nAccording to Eje, \u201cThe new investment takes us one step closer to fulfilling our mission of building the largest network of profitable African farmers using technology to ensure food security. We look ahead with renewed confidence knowing that our smallholder farmers will benefit financially even more from this new investment.\u201d\n\nFaster Internet for Oyo residents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents of Oyo, a state in South-Western Nigeria, are about to witness improved Internet speeds following a partnership between Tizeti and Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough the Microsoft Airband Initiative, the two organisations will leverage low-cost wireless technology to make Internet connection easier and cheaper for state residents.\n\nIn a statement, Tizeti\u2019s CEO, Kendall Ananyi, said, \u201cWe are happy to work with Microsoft on the Airband Initiative as it extends our mission of bringing affordable and reliable internet to more Nigerians outside the digital envelope.\u201d\n\nDespite the giant strides made by Africans in technology, there are still many on the continent who cannot afford to access the Internet. Consequently, they cannot benefit from opportunities that come with an Internet connection.\n\nWith a high unemployment rate and a youthful population, connecting more Nigerians to the Internet could go a long way to access more job opportunities.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Ananyi and Ifeanyi Okonkwo, Tizeti provides low-cost Internet access to Africans. The 2017 Y Combinator alumni currently serve Nigeria and Ghana and have previously raised a $2.1 million seed funding and $3 million in a Series A round.\n\nLessons from Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, the Egyptian startup ecosystem has received more attention as its startups attract multi-million dollar investments. This growth has been partially aided by policies that favoured the creation of startups.\n\nThis week, some of Egypt\u2019s largest banks have decided to throw their weight and money behind the country\u2019s fintech startups with the launch of Nclude, a fintech-focused fund. The banks include the National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire, eFinance Investment Group, Egyptian Banks Company, and Banque Misr.\n\nThe banks have partnered with Global Ventures in an $85 million investment. Already, the coalition has invested in four startups, including Lucky, Khazna, Paymob, and Mozare3.\n\nIn a statement, Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, said, \u201cThis step is an implementation of the directives of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to support innovative youth in the fintech and fintech-enabled sectors, as well as CBE\u2019s fintech and innovation strategy which aims to create an enabling environment for the fintech industry and adopt more innovative fintech solutions capable of delivering banking and financial services to all segments of society more easily and at less cost, as a crucial step to transform Egypt into a regional centre for the fintech industry in the Arab World and Africa.\u201d\n\nPoor financial services have meant Africa\u2019s predominantly youthful population slowly gravitating towards fintech startups. In response, traditional banks have launched similar services to stay competitive.\n\nOn the flip side, these startups have also been on the receiving end of harsh government policies. However, this approach by Egypt\u2019s biggest banks is a welcome development and could foster collaboration between banks and fintech startups in the country. Rather than stifle growth, other African countries will do well to borrow a leaf from Egypt.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nFantasy sports apps are driving a surge in gambling addiction in India.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nIt was a black Monday in China yesterday following a crash of flight MU5735 in Guangxi province. According to reports, a 6-year-old Boeing 737-800 carrying 132 people crashed after it sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 feet to 3,225 feet in three minutes.\n\nMy reaction to the unfortunate news was, \u201cBoeing, not again!\u201d after I remembered a Netflix documentary, Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, detailing the Boeing MAX 737 scandal.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I mentioned how real-crime documentaries leave me upset and how I\u2019m, unfortunately, obsessed with them. If you\u2019re wondering what upsets me about these documentaries outside the crimes, it\u2019s how little justice is served if ever it gets done. There\u2019s only so much the heart can take, you know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, let\u2019s get into what we\u2019re discussing this today:\n\nOf scandals and toxic work cultures\n\nLendsqr: Shopify for African lenders\n\nFund rain in Kenya\n\nOf toxic workplace cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian Tech Twitter came alive yesterday following an investigative piece by TechCabal\u2019s Damilare Dosumu about Nigerian payroll startup, Bento Africa\u2019s co-founder/CEO, Ebun Okubanjo, who was accused of verbal abuse, undeserved termination of employment, inappropriate behaviour, and overall toxicity at the workplace.\n\nThe article, which incited a lot of emotions, took a long time to put together before a break came in March, as revealed by the author. This was after initial efforts to be granted interviews by former employees failed. Eventually, some ex-staff and current workers at the startup contributed to the piece either anonymously or with full disclosure.\n\nGet the full gist: Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa\n\nThe central topic of discussion \u2014 toxic workplace cultures \u2014 has been escalated by different people who have either been recipients of such harsh conditions at other organisations or have had to come to the rescue of someone who was. Asides from that, there\u2019s been a lot of finger-pointing, too many to keep track of.\n\nIf anything, the attending reactions have encouraged more people to speak up; some legal personnel were seen promising support to anyone interested in litigation and health workers encouraged victims to consider therapy. Consequently, a Twitter Space with over 17,000 participants at its peak and ran for more than five hours had people sharing experiences.\n\nAll these leave some questions behind. When the initial rage wears out, what would be the long term implications of discoveries like this? Would it push employers to be deliberate about promoting a healthy workplace culture? Could it encourage more aggrieved employees to speak out in real-time to expose any infringement on rights? Does this mean Africans will give sincere reviews about companies without fear on platforms like Glassdoor?\n\nFor a moment, it appears we\u2019re moving away from the reality that protecting employee interest in the Nigerian tech space is harder than it looks. And, I think that\u2019s great. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopify for African lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Founder, Lendsqr\n\nEfforts to help Africans build strong credit muscles didn\u2019t start today, and they are coming in different forms. From digital lending platforms to buy-now-pay-later models, to loan retrieval solutions.\n\nIn a recent development, Adedeji Olowe, Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria, came up with a solution to give credit access to Africans, a pretty tricky space to play, in my opinion. However, leaning on his neck-deep experience in the fintech space, he seems to have covered the basics.\n\nRead his story here: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nThe deets: Deciding not to go the conventional way, the resulting startup, Lendsqr\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\nHow is it doing this? Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nSo far, the founder claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of information to unpack, why don\u2019t you enjoy the full story as written by Emmanuel Paul.\n\nRead here: Lendsqr is building the Shopify for lending in Africa\n\nFund rain in Kenya: Powered by People, Apollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Eli Pollak (Co-founder & CEO), Benjamin Njenga (Co-founder & CCO), and Earl St Sauver (Co-founder). Source: Supplied\n\nAfrica\u2019s eCommerce scene seems to be getting streams of investments despite the argument that the industry is barely thriving on the continent.\n\nEmmanuel tried to make sense of this a few months ago, and you can catch a bit of a similar conversation on Techpoint Africa Podcast latest release (Ignore the warning).\n\nBack to the gist. Doesn\u2019t it seem investors are seeing what many people aren\u2019t? Last week, it was Wasoko(formerly, Sokowatch) raising $125m series B led by Tiger Global. Months before that, five other eCommerce startups have raised $275m combined in VC fund and debt financing.\n\nYesterday, Kenya-based Powered by People raised a $5m seed led by Susa Ventures and Golden Ventures with participation from a number of investors including Flexport Ventures, J Ventures, and the founders of DraftKings and Fabric.\n\nThe startup powers a B2B eCommerce marketplace to connect small businesses with retailers while removing any supply chain inconveniences, thereby giving them visibility into both local and international retail markets.\n\nPowered by People also offers credit facilities to businesses to help speed up production so as to meet up with demand. The fund raised is to get more clients and increase the startup\u2019s reach across borders.\n\nConsidering its trajectory, the three-year-old startup expects to grow its annual run rate to $25m from $15m.\n\nRead more: Kenya-based Powered by People gets $5 million seed to scale operations of its wholesale e-commerce platform\n\nIn another news, Kenyan-founded agritech startup, Apollo raised $40m in a Series B round led by Softbank with participation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Yara Growth Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst, CDC, among others. This is coming after a $6m Series A in 2020 and $1m in debt financing in 2021.\n\nListen to Apollo\u2019s story here.\n\nFounded in 2016, the startup provides small-scale farmers with all they need to boost their productivity, like credit facilities, product financing, and insurance.\n\nWith this raise, Apollo plans to spread its tentacles into West Africa and other parts of East Africa.\n\nRead more: Kenya-based agritech Apollo raises $40 million in Softbank-led round, joined by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, CDC\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nAmazon\u2019s Africa headquarters may be put on hold over indigenous people\u2019s concerns.

As many as 4 in 10 Nigerians live below the national poverty line,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt added that shaping the specifics of Nigeria\u2019s poverty-reducing policies will depend strongly on redoubling efforts to gather and analyze data regularly.\n\nCommenting on the report, Tara Vishwanath, World Bank Lead Economist and co-author of the report noted that as conflict is spreading and intensifying across Nigeria, it is important to implement programs to support poor and vulnerable Nigerians that are simple and flexible while also limiting the risk of exacerbating fragility and conflict.\n\n\u201cData can provide vital guidance on how to design, monitor, and evaluate pro-poor projects and programs, giving a voice to poor and vulnerable Nigerians\u201d added Jonathan Lain, World Bank Economist and co-author of the report.\n\nRead also: Many rich Nigerians one shock away from poverty \u2013 W/Bank\n\nThe report further notes that jobs do not translate Nigerians\u2019 hard work into an exit from poverty, as most workers are engaged in small-scale household farm and non-farm enterprises; just 17 percent of Nigerian workers hold the wage jobs best able to lift people out of poverty.\n\n\u201cThe report adds that climate and conflict shocks, which disproportionately affect Nigeria\u2019s poor are multiplying, and their effects have been compounded by COVID-19; yet government support for households is scant.\n\n\u201cHouseholds have adopted dangerous coping strategies, including reducing education and scaling back food consumption, which could have negative long-run consequences for their human capital.\u201d\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria said,\u201cIt is clear that much needs to be done to help lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty, including boosting health and education, bolstering productive jobs, and expanding social protection.\n\n\u201cYet implementing pro-poor initiatives requires unlocking fiscal space; reforming expensive subsidies including fuel subsidies will be essential, alongside countervailing measures to protect the poor as reforms are effected.\u201d",

          "text": "The World Bank has said in a new report that many rich Nigerians are only one small shock away from falling into poverty.\n\nThe multilateral lender, in its \u2018Nigeria Poverty Assessment 2022\u2019 report, said the COVID-19 crisis was driving up Nigeria\u2019s poverty rate, pushing more than five million additional people into poverty by 2022.\n\n\u201cWith real per capita GDP growth being negative in all sectors in 2020, poverty is projected to have deepened for the current poor, while those households that were just above the poverty line prior to the COVID-19 crisis would be likely to fall into poverty,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the report, given the effects of the crisis, the country\u2019s poverty headcount rate is projected to jump from 40.1 percent in 2018/19 to 42.0 percent in 2020 and 42.6 percent in 2022, implying that the number of poor people was 89.0 million in 2020 and would be 95.1 million in 2022.\n\nIt said compounding macroeconomic frailties, shocks and uncertainty might blight Nigeria\u2019s progress on poverty reduction, adding that climate change could intensify shocks, further limiting opportunities to spread the proceeds of growth.\n\n\u201cMany non-poor Nigerians are only one small shock away from falling into poverty, while those who are already poor could be pushed into even deeper deprivation,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nAccording to the report, climate-related shocks \u2013 such as floods and droughts \u2013 are particularly harmful because they threaten the rain-fed agricultural and pastoral activities that are common among households living below or just above the poverty line.\n\nRead also: CIBN Partners ACAMB to bridge management gap in Nigeria\u2019s Banking Sector\n\nIt said, \u201cUncertainty about when such shocks may hit, combined with a lack of coping or insurance mechanisms, can trap households in poverty by discouraging the adoption of high-risk, high-reward technologies or investment in human and physical capital.\n\n\u201cThis problem may currently be getting worse: climate change threatens to make floods and droughts more frequent and more severe, compounding this challenge for poverty reduction in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGiven the influence of shocks on income generation, it becomes even harder for any growth to percolate to Nigerian households and raise their living standards. Alongside increasing climate shocks, conflict events have proliferated, displacing populations, disrupting markets, and interrupting Nigerians\u2019 livelihoods.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank noted that fatal conflict events had become more widespread across Nigeria in the past two decades, especially in the country\u2019s north.\n\nIt said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s dependence on oil exports is one of the leading causes of its frail growth prospects; it may also prevent any growth from being broad-based.\n\n\u201cLow revenue mobilisation also leaves Nigeria fiscally constrained, making it more difficult for the government to invest in the infrastructure, human capital, and social protection needed to promote inclusive growth.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank said other distortionary policies, especially on exchange rates and trade, could further weaken Nigeria\u2019s prospects for inclusive growth and poverty reduction.\n\nIt said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s multiple exchange rates for different types of transactions and the country\u2019s trade restrictions including bans on certain goods and the 2019 border closure may reduce investor confidence.\n\n\u201cThis, in turn, could limit foreign direct investment and competition, factors required to support firms and the job creation needed for broad based growth.\u201d\n\nThe report said such policies could also have immediate negative effects on poverty reduction through the price channel, as trade restrictions could make the goods that poor households consume, especially food items more expensive, reducing people\u2019s purchasing power and welfare in turn.\n\n\u201cThe pro-poor government spending that could broaden the base of growth is currently lacking in Nigeria,\u201d the World Bank added.",

This emphasizes the special relationship that Edo State, as a sub-national, and the Italian government enjoys. We have had a long-standing relationship as you pointed out and are very glad that, under your leadership, we are hitting the ground running.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs you know, we are currently working on a lot of initiatives with the federal government and the Italian authorities, and this derives from what we have done in the past. In the past five years, we have been working with the Italian authorities and have been able to significantly limit and reduce the incidents of irregular migration and human trafficking in Edo.\n\n\u201cMigration has become a global phenomenon; you cannot stop it, but can only manage it. Our people love to travel; many have established and they are doing well, which serves as an impetus for many more who want to go.\n\n\u201cBut we have to regulate that process. That is where we would be discussing with you and the federal authorities. The conversation has started on the new structure for our response to migration; we call it migration 2.0.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHere, we are saying that in addition to what have been doing in the last five years, which is first to resettle those who want to come back home and integrate them into the society, as well as try to deal with the root causes of migration so that we can reduce the number of people who want to migrate as migration is linked to development.\u201d\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cIn this new policy, we want to amend our laws on human trafficking and irregular migration and in addition, try to put in pathways for regular migration. We should move from migration to trade and investment.\n\n\u201cWe are creating the enabling environment for businesses to thrive in Edo State. Whatever businesses they are doing there, there is really no reason why they cannot bring some of the capital back home.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Italian Ambassador, who reassured the continuous support of the Italian government, hailed the governor\u2019s efforts in the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nHe noted, \u201cGlobal migration is a phenomenon that is unstoppable. This visit is another opportunity to look at it as a game-changer and fully share your vision and outline how we can work together, starting from the work you did in the fight against human trafficking.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to look at the migration clause that is legal and then create opportunities to attract investments from Europe, especially from Italy. I think these are the common ground on which we can work together.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We don\u2019t just want to strengthen our TVET schools, we want to mainstream TVET so that from primary school, our pupils are exposed to handiwork.\n\n\u201cWe call it pre-apprenticeship training. With this, any pupil that wants to go to a TVET school can do so. If they go the TVET route, that doesn\u2019t mean that is where their education stops; they can decide to go on to read medicine or go to a polytechnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We just want to ensure that basic education, as stipulated by the 2004 UBE Act, which first 10 years of education, is free and compulsory, and by the time a student is graduating from JSS 3, we want them not only to be literate and numerate, we also want them to be skilled,\u201d she added.\n\nOn formalizing the informal skilled sector in the state, the Commissioner noted that going forward, the state would ensure that all electricians, plumbers, welders and tailors among other artisans operating in the state, work in line with the guidelines of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\n\u201cSo, for our informal apprenticeship sector, we want to link that with our adult education system. If you are already an artisan; a master craftsperson, but you don\u2019t know how to read, we can send you to our adult education school; it is free. That is for those who are already established.\n\n\u201cFor new apprenticeship that will be coming into the system, we are now going to say you must know how to read and write.\u201d\n\nThe mainstreaming of skill acquisition, technical and vocational studies, Oviawe explained, would be extended to Special Needs Schools in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, mainstreaming skilled acquisition, technical and vocational is not just in our regular schools, the governor has mandated that we should extend to our Special Needs schools.\n\n\u201cWe want to train the next generation to be self-sufficient.

          "title": "PDP governors meet, decry prevailing economic hardship, promise to rescue Nigeria from APC",
          "text": "Governors elected under the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, on Wednesday, met in Aba Abia State to access the performance of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in 2015, and returned with the verdict that the country is now worse off than it was in 2015.\n\nRegretting the state of insecurity and rapid increase in prices of food and other essential commodities, the governors noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC.\n\nThe governors in a communique issued at the end of their meeting, said the APC has continued to inflict excruciating hardship on Nigerians, even as they noted that the party was its way to collapsing.\n\nThe meeting which was attended by every other PDP governor, apart from Darius Ishaku of Taraba State who was represented by the deputy governor, Haruna Manu, offered the governors an opportunity to access the performance of the President Muhammadu Buhari led APC government since its inception in 2015.\n\nAfter assessing the performance of the ruling party, the governors concluded that Nigeria was failing under its watch and asked that they be given the opportunity to save it in 2023.\n\nThe communique read the in full: \u201cThe PDP Governors\u2019 Forum comprising all elected Governors of the Peoples Democratic Party held its regular meeting on Wednesday, 23rd March, 2022, at Aba, Abia State.\n\nThe meeting reviewed the excruciating hardship and suffering being meted out to Nigerians by a failed APC led Federal Government; the near collapse of the APC as a viable political party, the readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation and issued the following Communique:\n\n1. We lament the terrible pain and hardship facing Nigerians in virtually all aspects of life. The meeting noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC as exemplified in the following Comparative Indicators obtained mainly from the National Bureau of Statistics:\n\na. Diesel which is critical for running of SMEs was N131.47 in 2015, it now costs above N700\n\nb. Fuel: Official and Black-Market was N87/155 in 2015, it now costs N167/350.\n\nc. Aviation Fuel/Air Ticket Rate on Domestic Flights was N110 per Litre/N18,000 in 2015, it now hovers around N700 per Litre/N70,000, where available. Indeed, the scarcity of fuel which has resulted in loss of several man hours is a disgrace to Nigeria.\n\nd. The collapse of the National Grid (126 times in 7 years \u2013 (June 2015 to March 2022) and its consequences for non-availability of power is most unfortunate.\n\ne. Kerosene (NHK) used by the ordinary Nigerian for cooking and power was N180 in 2015, it now sells at \u20a6450.\n\nf. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \u2013 12.5kg Cylinder sold for N2,400 in 2015, is now sold at between N8,750 and N10, 000.\n\ng. Prices of basic food stuffs are now three times higher than what they used to be in 2015. Staple foods such as rice, beans, cassava flakes are now slipping out of the hands of average Nigerians. Indeed, a Bag of Rice sold for N8500 in 2015 is now N39,000.\n\nh. Electricity was N14.23 per kilowatt in 2015, it is now N38.530, and not even available.\n\ni. Unemployment rate was 11.4% in 2015, it is now over 33%, one the highest in the world.\n\nj. The poverty rate in 2015 was 11.3% but now about 42.8%.\n\nk. Accumulated Inflation in 2015 was about 4%, it is now 15.50%; Inflation Rate was 9.01% in 2015 and now 15.7%.\n\nl. Perhaps the Exchange Rate has been one of the most disastrous. N150 to a dollar was the parallel market (patronised by most businessmen and Nigerians) rate in 2015, it is now about N580 to $1 in the parrel market and still rising.\n\nm. Debt and Debt Servicing:\n\nDomestic Debt of N8.4T and External Debt of USD 7.3b was incurred between 1999-2015.\n\nWhile Domestic Debt of N7.63T (June 2015-Dec 2020) and USD28.57b as at Dec 2020 was incurred. External debt of USD21.27b was incurred between June 2015 and 2021.\n\nn. National Debt to GDP Ratio was 23.41% (2016) it is now 36.88% (2022).\n\no. The Corruption Index has risen from 136 in 2015 to 150 now.\n\np. Nigeria\u2019s Misery Index, an indicator used in determining how economically well off the citizens of a country are, is usually calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the annual inflation rate, has moved from 14.75 percent in 2015 to 50.48 (2021).\n\nq. The major threat to the agricultural sector and food security in Nigeria is insecurity. In the northeast of Nigeria, it is estimated that no fewer than 70,000 hectares of arable farmland have been abandoned in the affected States and Local Government areas. The trend is the same all over the country. This further contributes to food inflation. The APC led Federal Government must take steps to cooperate with States to bring security down to the grassroots.\n\n2. The Forum is surprised that in the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023.\n\nThis shows how uncaring and insensitive the APC is. IT HAS BECOME A MENACE TO NIGERIA.\n\n3. The Forum urges Nigerians to reject the APC, a party run undemocratically by a Committee contrary to the Constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates. It is impossible for a party so disorganized to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria.\n\n4. The meeting expressed concern and alarm over various reports and claims of incidents of stealing of crude oil ranging from 80% to 95% of production made by industry practitioners and called on the Federal Government to set up an appropriate mechanism to reverse this trend and bring perpetrators to account.\n\n5. The PDP Governors once again decried the inability of the NNPC to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, inspite of Oil selling at above $110. It is patently unconstitutional for NNPC to determine at its whim and discretion when and what to pay to the Federation Account, as it is a mere trustee of the funds for the three tiers of Government: Federal, States and Local Governments. We once again, call for investigations and audit of the quantity of consumption of fuel ascribed to Nigerians and for deployment of technology at the filling stations to determine in a transparent manner the volume of consumption.\n\nThe Governors would resist any further attempt by NNPC to ascribe unsubstantiated subsidy claims to other tiers of government.\n\n6. Furthermore, S.162 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended stipulates that \u201cThe Federation shall maintain a special account to be called \u201cthe Federation Account\u201d into which shall be\n\npaid all revenues collected by the Government of the Federation\u2026\u201d\n\nand S.162 (10) states that \u201cFor the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, \u201crevenue\u201d means any income or return accruing to or derived by the Government of the Federation from any source and includes \u2013\n\n(a) any receipt, however described, arising from the operation of any law;\n\n(b) any return, however described, arising from or in respect of any property held by the Government of the Federation;\n\n(c) any return by way of interest on loans and dividends in respect of shares or interest held by the Government of the Federation in any company or statutory body\u201d\n\na. As of today, 18 (Eighteen) Federation Revenue Agencies are not paying/remitting any revenue to the FAAC Account. These include (i) Central Bank of Nigeria (ii) Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) (iii) Nigeria Liquefied National Gas (NLNG) (iv) Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) (v) Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) (vi) NPA (vii) Security and Exchange Commission etc\n\n(b) FIRS and DPR takes cost of collection of 4% (Four percent) of Revenue collected while Customs collects 7%. In March 2022 for instance, FIRS took N15.4Billion as cost of collection and Customs took N8.4b. If these are annualised, FIRS and Customs collects about N1.84Billion and Customs N100B per annum. Obviously, some states of the Federation\u2019s capital budget does not come close to these.\n\n(c) Nigeria Federation has 49% shareholding in NLNG. According to the Minister of Finance during the 2020 budget performance brief at the National Assembly stated that the federation received dividend of N144billion (One Hundred and Forty Four Billion) from NLNG. These figure to the best of our knowledge was never paid into the Federation Account.\n\n(d)) NNPC deducts N8.33Billion monthly for the rehabilitation of the Refineries in Nigeria. Till date no refinery is working.\n\n(e) On priority projects of the Nation\u2019s oil industry, NNPC deducted N788.78Billion for various investments between 2018-2021 without recourse to FAAC.\n\n(f) NNPC in 2021 alone claimed to have paid over One Trillion Naira as petroleum subsidy. Indeed, the month of March 2022, N220Billion was deducted as oil subsidy with a promise that N328Billion will be deducted in April 2022. This is unacceptable.\n\n(g) NNPC and FIRS as well as other remitting Agencies continue to apply an exchange rate of N389/$1 as against the Import and Export window of N416/$1. The extent of this leakage can be better felt, if this rate is compared to the current N570/$1.\n\n(h) From available records about N7.6T is withheld between 2012 and 2021, by NNPC from the Federation Account. All these are said to be payments for oil subsidy.\n\n(i) Conclusively, we believe that all these leakages in NNPC have been made possible because the President is also the Minister of Petroleum. The urgent separation of these two portfolios have become necessary\n\n7. The Forum noted the approval by the PDP NEC of the Time Table and Timelines for Congresses and Convention of the Party and urged all party members and party leadership to remain focused and united to win power in 2023, to tackle the myriads of problems facing the country.\n\n8. The PDP Governors congratulated the host, His Excellency, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum Vice Chairman, for his generosity and hospitality in the hosting of the meeting.\n\n9. In attendance are:\n\n\u2022 Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal \u2013 Sokoto State \u2013 Chairman\n\n\u2022 Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu \u2013 Abia State \u2013 Vice Chairman\n\n\u2022 Gov.

Her rendition of the piano piece elicited wide applause from audiences across the three cities.\n\nDuring one of her media interviews, Pauline explained to students that U.S. universities encourage musicians to double major in a subject outside of music.

          "title": "Russia keeps mum over heavy military losses in Ukraine",
          "text": "Russian military officials are keeping mum over the heavy losses sustained in the Ukrainian war since the last report on 2 March.\n\nThen the Ministry of Defence put the dead soldiers at 498. It has not updated its troop casualties till today.\n\nUkraine puts the figure at 15,600 dead soldiers, including senior officers.\n\nNATO paints a more grim picture of casualties, up to 40,000 Russian troops killed, wounded, taken prisoner or are missing in Ukraine.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization calculates the figure based on information provided by Ukrainian authorities and information obtained from Russia\u2013both officially and unintentionally, the official said.\n\nNATO estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24. Using statistical averages from past conflicts that for every casualty roughly three soldiers are wounded, NATO analysts reach their total figure.\n\nRussia began its invasion with roughly 190,000 troops. It has since brought in additional troops from Chechnya, Syria and other locations\n\nOn Wednesday a funeral service was held for Andrei Paliy, the deputy commander of its Black Sea Fleet in annexed Crimea, the latest in what Ukraine says is a string of high-ranking Russian military casualties since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak on Sunday named six Russian generals who he said had been killed in Ukraine along with dozens of colonels and other officers.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry has not confirmed any of those casualties.\n\nLocal Russian government in the southern port of Novorossiysk confirmed the death on Feb. 28 of Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky in a statement on its website. It said he had served in Syria, the North Caucasus and Abkhazia.\n\nKonrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, said the Ukrainian estimates of Russian high-ranking casualties were plausible, but they were difficult to verify and the actual figure was probably smaller.\n\n\u201cEven if we are talking about two generals, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not only talking about generals, we\u2019re also talking about colonels who are of course also really high in the organisation.\u201d\n\nHe said such casualties suggested Russia didn\u2019t have a good understanding of Ukrainian artillery positions and Ukraine was having success in pinpointing the location of senior Russian officers, possibly via their mobile phone signals.\n\n\u2018TOO MANY COLONELS, TOO FEW CORPORALS\u2019\n\nA senior foreign diplomat in Moscow told Reuters: \u201cFor me what is important is the reported heavy casualties at colonel and above, the backbone of the Russian army, not just generals,\u201d\n\nThe diplomat said the Russian army was heavily centralised and hierarchical, and lacking in empowered Western-style junior officers. \u201cThere are too many colonels, too few corporals. So what happens is tasks requiring resolution, which in the West would be resolved at much lower levels, get passed up the chain for decision,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe diplomat said that the hierarchical structure drew senior officers to the front to sort out problems or revitalise the effort, leaving them vulnerable to attack.\n\n\u201cCentralisation of command and control, lack of dispersal, and paucity of secure communication also puts them in locations where they can be identified and picked off by Ukrainian UAVs,\u201d the diplomat said, referring to unmanned drones.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States.\n\nRussia says its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the \u201cgenocide\u201d of Russian speakers by Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has dismissed those claims.\n\nReuters via NAN",

          "text": "The immediate past Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Akan Okon, said he still keeps a warm relationship with the governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, despite the governor\u2019s endorsement of someone else as his preferred successor.\n\nMr. Okon, who is also contesting for the governorship of Akwa Ibom state, said the Governor has been his friend for more than 40 years, he said he will not sacrifice his relationship with the Governor because of politics.\n\n\u201cGovernor Udom Emmanuel is my friend. This is my 40th year of friendship with the Governor. Nothing will stand in the way of our relationship. Akwa Ibom people will continue to see us together.\u201d\n\nMr. Okon resigned his appointment as Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport on Monday 14th March, to contest for the governorship of the State.\n\nAt a post-resignation press conference on Sunday, Mr. Okon said having been part of the Udom Emmanuel administration, he better understands the policy direction of the government and will ensure that there is no dislocation in completion of all ongoing projects.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Governor Udom Emmanuel has done well. He has embarked on several projects that are legacy projects. And some of these projects cannot be completed in the lifespan of this administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s need for someone who has an understanding of the system, and who will be able to continue with these projects so as to ensure that they are completed to serve the purpose it was intended for the Akwa Ibom people.\n\n\u201cGovernor Emmanuel\u2019s development of the state is based on three gateways, that\u2019s the land, the sea and the air. And fortunately, I am the one who handled all the projects in these three areas.\n\n\u201cAt 34, Akwa Ibom State cannot afford to be an experimental field where people come to learn leadership in public service.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who has been around, and who understands the various sectors of the economy and the challenges that are facing our people so that from day one; he will hit the ground running in embarking on those programmes and policies that will lead to an improvement to the standard of living of our people.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I am better equipped to be able to continue with what His Excellency has done so that Akwa Ibom State can be what we all want it to be\u201d, he said.\n\nThe governorship aspirant said the state has a lot of intelligent and very enterprising young men and women who are looking for opportunities to serve their fatherland, adding that he has what it takes to create such an environment.\n\n\u201cFor our young men and women who have business ideas, we will get in place business incubation centres that will focus on training of these young people in respect of their ideas and we will develop and support them in all ramifications.\n\n\u201cAs the economic development commissioner, I obtained approval for a 30\u2013year development plan for our state because we cannot continue to base our development on annual budget.\n\n\u201cWhat is obtainable in other climes is that they have long term plans and with this long term plan, they use a medium term expenditure framework to implement it.\n\n\u201cWith that in focus, there is a direction.

          "text": "The Chairman Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has said more than anything, the factor of demography would determine who becomes president in 2023.\n\nHe also declared that any thought about Muslim-Muslim or Christian \u2013 Christian ticket in the nation\u2019s political permutation in the next general elections \u201cis dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nBy the dictionary meaning, demography means \u201cthe study of statistics such as births, deaths, income, or the incidence of disease, which illustrate the changing structure of human populations.\u201d\n\nHe spoke Tuesday during a meeting with former Presiding Officers of State Assemblies and House of Representatives at Fraser Suit, Central Business District Abuja.\n\nRather than dwelling on zoning, Tambuwal, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives (2011-2015), charged the PDP to be concerned about winning election and sharing power thereafter.\n\nTambuwal, who described himself as the most qualified to lead Nigeria come 2023 said, \u201cfrom the array of those that are running now I don\u2019t know of tomorrow, all the names being mentioned that are at the forefront of this consideration for 2023, I am the youngest of them all. Go and check our bio data, check the genuine one.\u201d\n\nOn the choice of his party as it concerns zoning and its next candidate, the governor appealed to PDP to study previous election results ahead of next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs leaders of our party, who are working towards winning election, not zoning, not winning tickets. Yes we can share ticket and everybody can take his piece and go to his zone. But you must plan to win election. That\u2019s the reality of it. It\u2019s not anybody\u2019s making.\n\n\u201cSo we must accept these realities as a party and work with these realities to win election. After we win, we can then say okay, let\u2019s share power. Win election first, don\u2019t win zoning, win the election and then we\u2019ll come and share power, because the President and the Vice President cannot come from the same zone. They cannot even come from the same religion.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they can hardly be of the same faith. If you have president and vice president; Muslim-Muslim, dead on arrival. In the current Nigerian situation, if you have both of them as Christian-Christian, dead on arrival. So you must balance the ticket.\u201d\n\nTo be Nigeria\u2019s president, he said, requires a lot of energy and intellectual capacity.\n\nLooking at how governorship and House of Representatives elections were contested and won in Anambra and Plateau states respectively, he concluded that demographics, intra-party wrangling in the All Progressives Congress (APC), voter education and others would determine the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, demography is an issue that is why after the election, I appealed to PDP to study the outcome of previous elections as we proceed to 2023.\u201d\n\nOn Jonathan\u2019s emergence as president\n\nThe former lawmaker also recalled his role in the emergence of then Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as president following the demise of President Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen it was time for the House of Representatives to go along the Senate on the issue of Doctrine of Necessity that made Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan President, my brother and friend, Dimeji Bankole was not willing to do so. My brother and friend, Senator Dickson Seriake, who was leading the squad for ex-President Jonathan to be made acting president, was doing it the wrong way.\n\n\u201cThere was tension and almost chaos in the House of Representatives. And we called Dickson. I sat him down. I said Dickson, if you go through that route of raising sentiments, this thing will not fly. Let\u2019s look at it objectively, speak about Nigeria and how to save our country. If you agree, take the backseat. I am the principal officer from the North-west zone of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. We\u2019re very aware of the situation of the country. So let me drive it and let me see who that person is that will have more affinity and affiliation to President Yar\u2019Adua than myself- the principal officer from the zone.\n\n\u201cDickson now accepted to take the back seat. We had several meetings. We had with Nafada, Ihedioha, Austin Okpara, who was outside the House of Reps but still our leader at that time. I drafted the motion that made Jonathan acting president in the House of Reps. Speaker Dimeji was a bit lackadaisical, he was not too sure. I walked up to him, as he was presiding. I said, Mr. Speaker, \u2018I know that I and you have been supportive of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. It\u2019s not about an individual now; it\u2019s not about the President it is about this country. I must appeal to you to support this initiative.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was a bit emotional. I said look Mr Speaker, it\u2019s about this country and we must do the right thing. I brought out the motion. I said this is the motion. I drafted it. So please, allow this to go. And that was how the motion for the Doctrine of Necessity was passed in the House.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the speedy concession of four new airport terminals constructed by a Chinese company at the international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the new terminal at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammad Airport in Lagos, the president also ordered the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed to source for funds for the country to immediately commence the construction of a second runway at the Abuja airport.\n\nThe facilities were constructed by the China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC) with a $500 million loan secured from the China Exim Bank, while the Nigerian government provided a counterpart funding of $100 million.\n\nWhile affirming that the concession of the four terminals would propel development of the aviation sector and grow the Nigerian economy, the president directed the finance ministry to work with the aviation ministry in ensuring the delivery of the two projects.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind the importance of airport infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, Foreign Direct Investment and development globally, this administration decided to prioritize the completion and delivery of five brand new international terminals, which were at 11% completion level when we came into power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis aligns perfectly with our Aviation Roadmap, which was developed in 2016, for the purposes of establishing critical infrastructure, including a National Carrier, Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul Centre and improved Airports Terminals through concession, to boost aviation practice and take the industry to the next level, reflecting global standards,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cGovernment is responding by further investments and partnerships in the sector to tend to this challenge. Consequently, the Minister of Aviation has been directed to fast track the airport concession programme. Similarly, the Abuja second runway is being fast tracked.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of FB&NP has been directed to source special funding for the project while the MFCT is directed to conclude the titling of the approved 12,000 hectares of land to accommodate the runway and other developmental projects.\u201d\n\nSirika\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Minister of Aviation Senator Hadi Sirika said the commissioning was a testament to the fact that President Buhari meant business for the aviation industry.\n\nSirika affirmed that the aviation industry remained the only way by which the 2063 agenda of the African Union (AU) could be realised.\n\nThe minister declared that one of the aims of the ministry was to grow aviation contributions to the GDP to 5 per cent at $4.7 billion from its present 0.06 per cent in the next few years.\n\nHe explained that there would be air-rail connectivity between the domestic and international airports to shorten the traffic time between both terminals.\n\nBesides, Sirika mentioned foreign exchange and Jet A1 as some of the challenges confronting the aviation industry, lamenting that these had led to numerous setbacks for the sector.\n\nHe appealed to President Buhari to direct the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to import Jet fuel in good quantity for operators in the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to mention that we stand to gain significant benefits in restoring and maintaining connectivity within, to and from the country. Analysis from IATA shows that aviation sector provides N341bn GDP contribution, 160,000 local jobs created and N535bn expenditure from visitors will be solely generated from restoring and maintaining this connectivity.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Sir, these are the numbers at risk if that connectivity is threatened by the continuous travel restrictions due to current pandemic. Mr. President, aviation business suffers from issue of access to foreign exchange by local and foreign airlines and the ability to repatriate blocked funds.\n\n\u201cNigeria currently holds $283m of foreign airlines funds blocked in the country. I would like to humbly request the support of the Central Bank, through the directive of Mr. President, to prioritise access to forex for all carriers both local and foreign and to work out a mechanism to clear the existing backlog urgently and prevent subsequent build up,\u201d the minister said.\n\nSanwo-Olu\n\nAlso in his remarks, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu lauded Buhari for giving infrastructure priority in its government.\n\nHe noted that the three projects commissioned Tuesday namely; Fertiliser, Lekki refinery and the new terminal would change the country\u2019s status.\n\nThe governor said all of these would not only create jobs for the teeming populace, but also open up the country to foreign investments and opportunities.\n\nThe new Lagos terminal has the capacity to process 14 million passengers per annum and built on a land mass of approximately 56,000 square metres with 66 check-in counters.\n\nOther facilities in the terminal include five baggage collection carousels, 16 Immigration desks at arrival, 28 Immigration desks at departure, eight security screening points, six passenger boarding bridges (out of which two have already been installed), two food courts, four premium lounges and 22 guest rooms and spa.\n\nOther facilities are 16 airline ticketing offices, visa on arrival and port health facility, as well as praying area, more than 3,000 square metres of duty free space and approximately 5,000 square metres of lettable utility space.\n\nCCECC commenced construction of four new terminals at Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt airports in 2013 with completion period fixed for 20 months.\n\nIts president, Yuan Li, had told the government during the visit of Nigeria\u2019s high-powered delegation to China that the quality of the work to be done at the airports would be of the highest international standard comparable to similar projects executed by the company in other parts of the world.",

          "text": "A Support Group \u201cNo Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019\u201d that worked assiduously for the re-election of President Mohamudu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the 2019 general elections, has described a national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the only qualified candidate to sustain president Buhari\u2019s endearing legacies in 2023.\n\nThe group in a statement issued on Wednesday by National Coordinator, Vincent Uba, said now that the Buhari administration is coming to an end, there\u2019s need to carefully look and select the best person to continue the good work of the president. This, they say is no other person than former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bolas Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe support group further stated that Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s religious tolerance is unequalled among the others, a man, despite the fact that he is a Muslim not just married one woman but chose a Christian as a wife.\n\nThey say with Tinubu as our president, forget about discriminating against other religions because there is no known case of him discriminating against his wife or any other person.\n\nThe statement reads further:\n\n\u201cWhy will President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo be seen as blessings to Nigeria in the face of economic hardship and security challenges? The answer is, God who sees beyond us chose the two great men to run the affairs of Nigeria, knowing that we would soon experience two global crises that would shake and humble the world.\n\n\u201cRecall the oil glut of 2015, which resulted in most countries of the world, including Nigeria, witnessing economic crisis that the citizens experienced excruciating hardship, affecting exchange rates of currencies. For Nigeria, it was not business as usual as our foreign reserve depleted that sourcing of foreign exchange to do international businesses became difficult.\n\n\u201cRecall also the Covid-19 pandemic that brought all countries of the world to their knees, which effects are still ravaging the world till date.\n\n\u201cThe combined devastating effects of these global crises and the already existing rot Nigeria suffered in the hands of the previous administrations of PDP would have made it almost impossible for any ordinary persons to steer the country out of the crises. This is where the supremacy of God who is all knowing comes in.\n\n\u201cHas anyone thought of or imagined what our fate as a country would have been if God had allowed the previous administrations that mismanaged the country in times of oil boom and plenty? Yes, what we complained of and suffer today would have been a child\u2019s play if that had happened.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo not only prudently managed the scarce resources of our country but also put in place infrastructures that are second to none, in comparison with the previous administrations. Rather than complain and blame President Buhari for the current harsh economic situations, we should applaud him and thank God for giving him to us at these trying times.\n\n\u201cNow that President Buhari\u2019s administration is coming to an end, there is the compelling need to look for and pray for someone that will not only carry on with the good legacies but also begin to build and improve on them. We, No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019, having critically observed and examined the state of the nation as it affects religious wars, ethnicity and leadership issues, decided to go for the man who the cap fits to tackle the above mentioned national problems.\n\n\u201cLooking at the array of persons aspiring for the presidency of this country in 2023, the only person, out of the lots who has the trappings and or paraphernalia to handle the affairs of the country is no other person than Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Yes, there is no alternative to Tinubu in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn Tinubu, we see a man whose religious tolerance is unequalled among the others, a man, despite the fact that he is a Muslim not just married one woman but chose a Christian as a wife. With Tinubu as our president, forget about discriminating against other religions because there is no known case of him discriminating against his wife or any other on the basis of religion.\n\n\u201cIn Tinubu we see a man who will not discriminate against any tribe in running the affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If Tinubu would display nationalistic tendencies in running Lagos State as a governor by accommodating and appointing people of other tribes in his cabinet, then the issue of discriminating against other tribes in governance as a president would not arise.\n\n\u201cHis track record of empowering people across ethnic and religious boundaries stands out. A noble man who has the gift of sourcing for round pegs to put in round holes or square pegs in square holes.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t know Tinubu and the stuff he\u2019s made of, a cursory look at his friends, associates, the quality of men and women he has made and empowered politically, financially and professionally gives you a perfect picture of who he is. Hence the dictum, \u201cShow me your friends and I will tell you who you are\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis man, Tinubu, will use the wisdom of age and experience to fix this country and lay a solid foundation for generations yet unborn, just as he laid an enduring solid foundation for the modern Lagos. In Tinubu, we see a man who has been known, tested and trusted such that Nigeria does not need an unknown Angel to take this country to the promised land of prosperity.\n\n\u201cRecall that Tinubu answered the divine call and aligned himself prior to 2015 with Buhari who had the divine mandate to keep this country going as a united country in the face of internal and global crisis. In the light of the above, No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 unequivocally not only endorses Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu for 2023 presidency of Nigeria, but also will put in place activities that will be geared towards supporting his campaigns.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 ( NATBO 2019) will now be known and referred to as No Alternative to Tinubu 2023 (NATT 2023),\u201d the group concluded.",

          "text": "Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sales from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, sending European gas prices soaring on concerns the move would exacerbate the region\u2019s energy crunch.\n\nEuropean countries\u2019 dependence on Russian gas and other exports has been thrown into the spotlight since Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically.\n\n\u201cRussia will continue, of course, to supply natural gas in accordance with volumes and prices \u2026 fixed in previously concluded contracts,\u201d Putin said at a televised meeting with top government ministers.\n\n\u201cThe changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,\u201d he said.\n\nRussian gas accounts for some 40% of Europe\u2019s total consumption and EU gas imports from Russia have fluctuated between 200 million to 800 million euros ($880 million) a day so far this year. The possibility a change of currency could throw that trade into disarray sent some European and British wholesale gas prices up around 15-20% on Wednesday.\n\nThe Russian rouble briefly leapt to a three-week high past 95 against the dollar before settling close to 100 after the shock announcement.\n\nPutin said the government and central bank had one week to come up with a solution on how to move these operations into the Russian currency and that gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) would be ordered to make the corresponding changes to gas contracts.\n\nWith major banks reluctant to trade in Russian assets, some big Russian gas buyers in the European Union were not immediately able to clarify how they might pay for gas going forward.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we do not yet wish to comment. We will be in touch once we have formed an opinion,\u201d said a spokesman at Germany\u2019s Uniper.\n\nMoscow calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d its neighbour. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.\n\nA BREACH OF RULES\n\nAccording to Gazprom, 58% of its sales of natural gas to Europe and other countries as of Jan. 27 were settled in euros. U.S. dollars accounted for about 39% of gross sales and sterling around 3%.\n\nThe European Commission has said it plans to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel \u201cwell before 2030\u201d.\n\nBut unlike the United States and Britain, EU states have not agreed to sanction Russia\u2019s energy sector, given their dependency.\n\nThe Commission, the 27-country EU\u2019s executive, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThere are questions over whether Russia\u2019s decision constitutes a breach of contract rules.\n\n\u201cThis would constitute a breach to payment rules included in the current contracts,\u201d said a senior Polish government source, adding that Poland has no intention of signing new contracts with Gazprom after their current long-term agreement expires at the end of this year.\n\nRussia drew up a list of \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions. Among other things, deals with companies and individuals from those countries have to be approved by a government commission.\n\nThe list of countries includes the United States, European Union member states, Britain, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and Ukraine.\n\nSome of these countries, including the United States and Norway, do not purchase Russian gas.",

          "text": "Members of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives Committee on Power on Tuesday criticised the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu mandating him to take concrete actions aimed at solving the current nationwide blackout rather than always presenting theories that do not translate into power supply to Nigerians.\n\nThe Committee, led by Hon. Magaji Da\u2019u Aliyu at a meeting with the minister, expressed disappointment over the lackadaisical attitude of the ministry towards power issues whenever there was national emergency, saying there was nothing in his presentation to show that the ministry was solving the challenge of increased power outages being experienced by the country.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Nebolisa Anoka, had enumerated the challenges facing the sector, ranging from low gas supply, low hydro levels, high cost of gas, as well as disequilibrium between power generation, transmission and distribution. This, he said had led to the collapse of the national grid and as well what the ministry was doing to salvage the situation.\n\nHe explained that in response to the challenges facing power generation, the ministry recently hosted an emergency meeting with key stakeholders in the gas-to-power value chain, during which far-reaching resolutions were arrived at on key measures needed to ameliorate the situation.\n\nReacting to the presentation, Aliyu, who earlier explained that the special interactive session was necessitated by the fact that Nigerians were facing the worst energy crisis in recent times, lamented that the situation had affected businesses, both small and large, which according to him had been attracting huge public outcry.\n\nHe called for the return of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET), under the supervision of the Power Ministry, saying that there was not much both the Ministry and the Committee could do if the agency remained elsewhere.\n\nAccording to him, these were part of the sectoral problems affecting the country in terms of power, as the agency which was tasked with the responsibility of evacuating unused electricity and bridging the gap debit gap between Gencos and Discos is not properly supervised.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is nothing on ground to show that there will be light or generation of up to 5000 megawatts, but we keep hearing about 30,000 megawatts of installed capacity across the power stations.\n\n\u201cIt may be recalled that Nigerians whom we represent experience one of the worst moment of electricity supply across the country. This development has caused variety of problems affecting peoples\u2019 welfare which makes social living condition very uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt has caused collapse of small businesses whose operations depend on stable electricity supply. The situation has also aggravated increased process in commodities and services especially those that require electricity supply.\n\n\u201cThe overheated socio-economic environment due to very poor electricity supply attracted huge public outcry for immediate solutions, especially given the contractual nature of provision of power and energy services in the post privatization era by the Nigerian Power Supply Industry.\n\n\u201cAgainst this background and acting as peoples\u2019 representatives, this interactive session is organised to request the Minister to among others: Explain the remote and immediate causes of the current deplorable power supply across the country; explain the technical, operational and administrative measures taken by the ministry to address the challenges and its devastating consequences against life, welfare and economy; and suggest in your highlight the areas which the House of Representatives or indeed the National Assembly can provide legislative support to overcome the challenges apparently disturbing all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Aliyu statement, members of the Committee, took turns to lament the unending projections by the Ministry that have never come to fruition.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Sada Soli (APC, Katsina), noted that the concern raised by Gencos as the major reason for the blackout, was the N1.4 trillion debt NBET was owing them as cost of generated but unused electricity.\n\nHe also noted three major concerns ranging from the quantity, quality and cost of gas delivered to them for their operations. Also, Hon. Aisha Dukku wondered if the ministry won\u2019t be able to resolve the problem till end of next year\n\nShe said: \u201cMr. Chairman, what the Permanent Secretary is telling us is end of next year. So, that means we will continue to be in darkness until end of 2023? Haba! No, no!\u201d\n\nOn his part, Hon. Muraino Ajibola, said, \u201cThese problems are not starting now. For instance, we know, every year, there will be shortage of water. We also know that most of time during the period of January to March, there is always this shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe have abundance of gas but we are not making use of it. What we do is fire brigade approach. Mr. Chairman, the summary of it is that we are not prepared to give our power and I think it\u2019s very sad. They also bring light when they want to send estimated bills to us.\u201d\n\nThereafter, the Chairman of the Committee ruled that the Permanent Secretary should return on Friday with more practical evidences of intended interventions.",

          "text": "The World Bank has identified sluggish growth, low human capital, labor market weaknesses and exposure to shocks as factors holding Nigeria\u2019s poverty reduction back.\n\nThe Washington-based institution stated this in its latest report titled: \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: Nigeria Poverty Assessment 2022,\u201d obtained Tuesday.\n\nThe report represented the culmination of the World Bank\u2019s engagement on poverty- and inequality-relevant data and analytics in Nigeria in the past two years.\n\nIt drew primarily on the 2018/19 Nigerian Living Standards Survey (NLSS), which provided Nigeria\u2019s first official poverty numbers in almost a decade, as well as the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS).\n\nThe surveys were implemented by Nigeria\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in collaboration with the World Bank.\n\nAccording to the report, which brought together the latest evidence on the profile and drivers of poverty in Nigeria, as many as four in 10 Nigerians live below the national poverty line.\n\nIt noted that many Nigerians \u2013 especially in the country\u2019s north \u2013 also lacked education and access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and improved sanitation.\n\nThe report further noted that jobs do not translate Nigerians\u2019 hard work into an exit from poverty, \u201cas most workers are engaged in small-scale household farm and non-farm enterprises; just 17 per cent of Nigerian workers hold the wage jobs best able to lift people out of poverty.\u201d\n\nThe report added that climate and conflict shocks \u2013 which disproportionately affect Nigeria\u2019s poor \u2013 were multiplying, and their effects had been compounded by COVID-19; \u201cyet government support for households was scant.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cHouseholds have adopted dangerous coping strategies, including reducing education and scaling back food consumption, which could have negative long-run consequences for their human capital.\n\n\u201cThese issues affect some parts of Nigeria more than others; the report captures this spatial inequality by providing statistics at the state level, which is crucial given Nigeria\u2019s federal structure.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that much needs to be done to help lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty, including boosting health and education, bolstering productive jobs, and expanding social protection,\u201d World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri said.\n\nHe added: \u201cYet implementing pro-poor initiatives requires unlocking fiscal space; reforming expensive subsidies \u2013 including fuel subsidies \u2013 will be essential, alongside countervailing measures to protect the poor as reforms are effected.\u201d\n\nThe report suggested at least three types of deep, long-term reforms to foster and sustain pro-poor growth and raise Nigerians out of poverty. These included: Macroeconomic reforms (including fiscal, trade, and exchange rate policy); policies to boost the productivity of farm and non-farm household enterprises; and improving access to electricity, water, and sanitation while bolstering information and communication technologies.\n\n\u201cThese reforms together could help diversify the economy, invigorate structural transformation, create good, productive jobs, and support social protection programs as well as other redistributive government policies.\n\n\u201cThe report emphasises that these reforms are urgent as Nigeria\u2019s population continues to grow; now is the time to ensure that the country seizes the promise of its young people for economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cIt adds that shaping the specifics of Nigeria\u2019s poverty-reducing policies will depend strongly on redoubling efforts to gather and analyse data regularly.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist and co-author of the report, Tara Vishwanath said: \u201cConflict is spreading and intensifying across Nigeria, so it is important to implement programs to support poor and vulnerable Nigerians that are simple and flexible while also limiting the risk of exacerbating fragility and conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cData can provide vital guidance on how to design, monitor, and evaluate pro-poor projects and programs, giving a voice to poor and vulnerable Nigerians,\u201d World Bank Economist and co-author of the report, Jonathan Lain added.\n\nThe report disclosed that new official household survey data, due to be collected later in 2022, would provide far more detailed insights into the dynamics of and the key constraints on poverty reduction, as well as new pro-poor policies.\n\nBy investing in data, Nigeria could build trust, accountability, and transparency, taking substantial strides on its pathway to poverty reduction.",
