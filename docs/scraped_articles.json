          "title": "Nothing must happen to Sowore -Adegboruwa",
          "text": "A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has warned that nothing must happen to #RevolutionNow activist, Omoyele Sowore.\n\nThe human rights lawyer said this after reports that Sowore was injured by a tear gas canister shot by a police officer during a rally in Abuja on Monday.\n\nThe police had since denied shooting Sowore, saying. \u201cThe protesters, who went on the rampage, were resisted by police operatives in order to prevent them from causing a breakdown of the law and order. There is no record of such an incident as of the time of this release.\u201d\n\nReacting, Adegboruwa asked the international community to hold the government of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), responsible for anything that happens to Sowore.\n\nThe lawyer also noted that Sowore was exercising his fundamental rights by joining a rally to demand good governance and an end to insecurity.\n\nHe said, \u201cInformation reaching me indicates that early this morning in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Comrade Omoyele Sowore and other activists gathered at the Unity Fountain for a peaceful protest but they were denied access to the public facility which was cordoned off by the police. From the live Facebook video that I personally monitored, I saw Mr. Sowore engaging some policemen on the illegality of locking up the Unity Fountain.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was civil and without any incident till the short video was terminated. I have however now been informed that shortly thereafter, some armed policemen stormed the Unity Fountain and released what appeared to be live bullets and tear gas into the crowd, with the consequent result that Mr. Sowore is presently in the hospital. It will be heartwarming to know that he has not been hit with any bullet from the alleged shooting.\n\n\u201cI urge all Nigerians and indeed the international community to hold the government of President Muhammadu Buhari responsible for anything that befalls Mr. Sowore on account of the lawful exercise of his fundamental rights. The Unity Fountain is a public place, where other citizens have held protests in support of the Buhari administration in the recent past, without let or hindrance and even with police escorts.\n\n\u201cIn the period when President Muhammadu Buhari was leading the opposition politicians, he led several protests across the country, without anyone shooting at him or other protesters. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in its section 40 allows freedom of assembly and in section 39, it grants to every citizen freedom of expression. I urge the police authorities to accord full respect for the fundamental rights of all citizens without the usual provocations.\n\n\u201cMr. Sowore has been the target of criminal prosecution, on account of his non-violent campaign for good governance and accountability. In consequence, he has been restricted to the city of Abuja, outside his home and workplace, away from his family and loved ones. I urge the government to allow Mr. Sowore to be and not to deploy the instruments of state coercion against a single individual, all in the attempt to break and silence him.\n\n\u201cThe lesson of the EndSARS campaign is to get all law enforcement agencies to embrace universal rules of civil engagements in order to avoid the usual casualties that follow their intervention in civil interactions with citizens.\n\n\u201cWe cannot run a nation where everyone is held captive and hounded into compulsory silence. Consequently, I urge all protesters to remain peaceful and law-abiding, while the government and its agents should follow the procedure of the rule of law in the maintenance of law and order.\u201d",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ochuko Akuopha\n\nUGHELLI \u2013 FORMER General Secretary of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, Chief Frank Kokori, has said that the Presidency, National Assembly and governors had let Nigerians down in tackling the worsening spate of insecurity bedeviling the country.\n\nKokori, who spoke on telephone, yesterday, wondered why President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cwill not want to talk to anyone about holding a national discourse\u201d saying that it was time to change the country\u2019s constitution once and for all.\n\nDescribing insecurity in the country as a national emergency, he urged the federal government to sit up and \u201cbe serious\u201d.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe president is the commander-in-chief and he should act. If he does not act, then the national assembly will put him on the spot. We elected him to protect us, he should protect the country. The country is going down the drain, people can\u2019t travel, people can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore, I was an opponent of restructuring, but today I am a supporter of restructuring. Before, I did\u2019t want to hear anything about state police because I felt the governors will abuse it the way they are abusing the state electoral commissions.\n\n\u201cEvery state should have a solid well equipped vigilante or what you call state civil defence or state vigilante. Fulani herdsmen don\u2019t have license before they have their arms. They (state police) should have licence and get their guns.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in the world or any point in history where you don\u2019t protect yourself . When there is war, you protect yourself, you don\u2019t use bare hands to protect yourself. Those Fulani herdsmen roaming around with AK47, who gave them license?\n\n\u201cThe federal government should sit up, they should be serious. All herdsmen from all over West Africa coming to Nigeria armed to the teeth, and you cant arrest them, you can\u2019t jail them, you cant do anything.\n\n\u201cYou even demoralize the police, because if the police arrest some of them, they say they should release them. That is the story I am hearing. Herdmen are killing and kidnapping people. There is a way government can storm kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhen kidnappers kidnap people, a solid government will storm them, there will be collateral damage yes. Everyday, you go and be paying ransom to kidnappers. When you pay ransom to them, then that\u2019s all.\n\n\u201cWhat is the military trained for? Military should have parachuters, that is what happens all over the world. They come with parachutters and storm the place. There will be collateral damage. You do that two, three times, the people will run away and nobody will be a kidnapper in this country agian.\n\n\u201cNow you are negotiating with them and they are collecting billions from people and you say you are running a government. The governors themselves should be ashamed of themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at this country, we just fought for this country for nothing. We have been talking of democracy, democracy came, they wasted it and destroyed the whole system. The governors, National Assembly and the Presidency should be ashamed of themselves. They let down the country.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nDele Sobowale\n\n\u201cTo know that which before us lies in daily life is the prime wisdom\u2026\u201d \u2013 John Milton, 1608-1674, Vanguard Book of Quotations, VBQ, P.275\n\nAfricans in general, and Nigerians, in particular, are slow learners. That is why the giant of Africa (Nigeria) will never go to the Moon or Mars \u2013 long after Fiji Island (population 200,000) had got there. From the information at my disposal, those citizens of the island state, at least, don\u2019t deceive themselves. Nigerians have never been honest with themselves.\n\nWe are in serious danger now, not just because of insecurity and the parlous economy, but because we too readily lie to ourselves. Worse still, we pretend to believe what we know is untrue and we want others to believe it too.\n\nWhen the N380/litre fuel is introduced, we would have reached the Next Level of national catastrophe. We are responsible for what will unfold from the minute the new fuel price is announced. We elected the Buhari government which will make our lives miserable to the end of its days.\n\nForecasting economic outcomes is an art and science\n\n\u201cEvery government is run by liars; and nothing they say should be believed.\u201d- I. F. Stone, 1907-1989\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t derive much pleasure anymore from being right most of the time. Virtually every article I have written in the last ten years on the Business/ Economy pages of newspapers had either involved forecasting the future economic outcome in one aspect of Nigerian life; or telling Nigerians \u201cI told you so\u201d.\n\nGovernments will always lie to the people. That is why the media exists in society. It is our sacred duty to let the people have the facts \u2013 without fear or favour. It is an obligation we don\u2019t always discharge as we should. We evade truths that hurt some individuals or in order to be popular. Yet, column writing is a trust. The columnist should not be engaging in popularity contest, but, in the search for and rendition of truth as close as he can get to it. What follows will not make you happy; but, it will be the truth.\n\n\u201cAllow an untenable economic situation to go on for too long; and, suddenly, there are no good options left.\u201d- Arthur Burns, former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nFor too long, any economist worth his salt had known that fuel subsidy was an economic mistake at first; it has turned to lunacy at last. Governments, from Babangida to Buhari now, had grappled with the attempt to end the intractable issue of fuel subsidy, but, every one of them had lacked the courage.\n\nThey have all caved in when the political fall-outs prove too irresistible. Yet, fuel subsidy, where and when it exists, amounts to government encouraging the people to live beyond their means. And, when such handout is financed by borrowing, it ends up as mortgaging the future for the benefit of the present generation. We are consuming now and passing the bill to our children and grand-children to pay. This is most unkind of our generation of adults. But, all things come to an end eventually. Fuel subsidy must end now.\n\n\u201cNGF mulls N380/litre fuel price.\u201d \u2013 News Report, May 20, 2021.\n\nThis bad news which was released by Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State needs to be quoted as delivered. According to him, \u201cThe committee recommends PMS pump price increment from the current N162 per litre to N408.5 per litre (negotiations on with organised labour unions. N380 per litre settlement with organised labour.\u201d)\n\nWhy El-Rufai accepted to be the spokesman for the Governors, given the monumental problems he faces in Kaduna State, is a mystery. I strongly believe the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum should have picked another spokesman to deliver this explosive message.\n\nThat said; let me interpret the message delivered in \u201cgovernmentese\u201d \u2013 an alien language to most Nigerians.\n\nIt is full of riddles. First, fuel subsidy removal is imminent \u2013 either totally or partially; either once and for all time or still trending.\n\nSecond, the governors, after demonstrating lack of courage and foresight, have been slugged by reality to acknowledge the fact that they cannot expect higher monthly revenue allocations from the Federation Account unless fuel subsidy is totally or partially removed. Third, the Federal Government, FG, which will eventually have to announce the bad news to Nigerians, has delegated its responsibilities for now.\n\nBut, the FG cannot chicken out for ever. It must address the nation because of the consequences that will follow. And, they will be severe on Nigerians everywhere in this country. Prayers cannot help us.\n\n\u201cWhatever a man prays for, he prays for a miracle. Every prayer reduces itself to this; Great God, grant that twice two be not four.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Ivan Turgenev, 1818-1883.\n\nI have received several calls from our readers wanting to know if indeed there is a subsidy to be removed; whether N380/litre fuel price should be acceptable and what would be the consequences of that quantum increase in fuel price. Too often, the callers don\u2019t voice their anxiety, namely, how to avoid the inevitable hyper-inflation. Let me address the last issue first.\n\nIncreasing fuel price from N162/litre to N380/litre, or 200 per cent, amounts to unofficial devaluation of the Naira. Prices of goods and services will escalate by at least 50 to 100 per cent. Aggregate inflation will rise above 30 per cent for the rest of the year.\n\nMost of us might not like to hear it, but, it needs to be said clearly. There is subsidy to remove. The landing cost of fuel exceeds the pump price by a wide margin. Unless we close it, the FG and states will become ungovernable. None will be able to pay the Minimum Wage to which they were foolishly committed in 2019.\n\nForget about the refineries\n\nEach time fuel price increase returns to the front of the national agenda, Nigerians ask the same foolish question. Don\u2019t ask me about our refineries. I am sick and tired of repeating the same thing about the scraps we call refineries. What is quoted above is what we were told in May this year. If you believe that, you will certainly believe anything. Three obvious reasons should inform your scepticism about that announcement.\n\nBuhari has only 24 months to go. No government has delivered any project on time. They would have exhausted the $1 billion before they go; the successor will have no funds to complete the job.\n\nTo be continued\u2026.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Geoffrey Anyanwu Enugu, Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nTension and anxiety have pervaded the whole of the South East and parts of South South states ahead of the sit-at-home ordered by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB).\n\nPro-Biafra groups had shifted the observance which is usually on May 30 to today because this year\u2019s anniversary fell on Sunday. However, many of their members used yesterday for prayers in the churches.\n\nIPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had warned, at the weekend, that any person that flouted the directive in the region would have him or herself to blame.\n\nSimilarly, MASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu, yesterday, warned the Nigeria security agencies that their threats would not hold waters. He advised them to steer clear during the commemoration of the Biafra day anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe can never be cowed or intimidated by empty threats of cowardice security agencies. Sit-at-home exercise must hold tomorrow. Our people will once again prove they want Biafra. The declaration of Biafra independence by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu must always stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThis came as the various police commands threatened to crush any form of procession or gathering relating to Biafra today.\n\nIn Onitsha, tension started building up on Saturday, May 29, following an alleged shooting of soldiers at Ihiala Local Government Area of the state by suspected gunmen which caused gridlock for hours at the Onitsha bridgehead due to tight security check there.\n\nThere was show-of-force patrol by joint-security forces along roads and streets of Onitsha and its environs, ostensibly to instil fear in anybody trying to cause breach of peace and breakdown of law and order.\n\nWithin the week, there was rush by people to the markets to make purchases and stock foodstuff due to fear of unknown during the exercise.\n\nAnnouncements were made in various churches in Onitsha during the services, advising worshippers to obey the sit-at-home order today to avoid any possible attack or being hit by stray bullets.\n\nAttendance in many churches was scanty due to fear, as many people assumed the sit-at-home started yesterday as it used to.\n\nChairman of Onitsha Main Market Association, Kenneth Onyeka, said the market will remain open for business.\n\nOne of the traders, Johnson Dikemba, told Daily Sun that for the past few years when Biafra Day was marked, the major markets in the Onitsha shut down to respect their fathers, grandfathers and mothers who lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nDecide what you want, Umahi tells residents\n\nEbonyi Governor, David Umahi, yesterday, seemingly recanted as he asked residents of the state to feel free to participate in the sit-at-home exercise if they so wished.\n\nThe governor had, on a statewide broadcast on Saturday evening to mark his six years in office, directed Ebonyi people to go about their normal businesses today.\n\nUmahi also said he had withdrawn his earlier threat to punish any trader who closed his shop in obedience to the order, saying it was within the rights of anyone to sit at home.\n\nHis Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, who addressed a press conference in Abakaliki, yesterday, said: \u201cEbonyi government has received several requests from some families and residents of the state, requesting they would like to remain indoors today to organise private family prayers in honour of their loved ones who were murdered during the civil war. Some of the people with this special request own shops in some of our markets across the state.\n\n\u201cWhile as a government, we remain resolute in the protection of lives and property of Ebonyians and all residents of Ebonyi State, we are aware that it is the right of anyone to remain at home or go about his/her normal businesses in this regard.\n\n\u201cFollowing the foregoing, Governor Umahi, who is highly in touch with the people has directed that those who may wish to remain at home with their shop(s) locked should neither be penalised, nor their shop(s) seized as it is their constitutional right while the rights of those who may wish to go about their normal businesses should not be infringed upon as it is equally their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nAnambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia set for sit-at-home\n\nIn Anambra, preparations for the sit-at-home appeared to have started on Saturday as there was panic buying by the residents of the state. Many residents thronged the markets to buy food stuffs that would last them till Tuesday.\n\nFood stuff markets all opened yesterday for business as those returning from churches were also seen stopping over to buy food items.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command said it was adequately prepared to ensure there would be no breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Daily Sun: \u201cWe are not deterred by the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate of protecting lives and property.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, said: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, today (yesterday) is the anniversary of the creation of Biafra. And Anambra State Government, in 2016, became the first and only administration in history to honour the memory of those who died in the fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cAmong the people who attended the solemn ceremony at Ekwueme Square was Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s first vice president. So, tomorrow (today) is not a public holiday.\u201d\n\nAsked if the civil service and schools would open today, he responded with a question: \u201cDid you hear that the government is closing down any school or declaring a public holiday or work free day? Tomorrow is just another day.\u201d\n\nAs at late yesterday evening, Imo residents appeared set to comply with the order IPOB order.\n\nRoads were getting completely deserted while most shops which normally opened on Sundays remained locked.\n\nAlso, many churches in the urban areas witnessed low turnout of worshipers while those that managed to hold services hurriedly closed.\n\nHowever, the police had assured residents of their safety, noting they had activated every tactical means to make sure no lives or property would be lost in the state today.\n\nSimilarly, a wave of uncertainty enveloped Enugu State, yesterday, ostensibly because of recent security threats.\n\nSo, many residents said they would like to stay indoors today to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n\nSome who are Federal Government workers said they would watch out first before taking any action, \u201cnow that the Federal Government facilities are targets.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, warned anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the relative peace and security enjoyed in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt would be vehemently resisted.\n\nHowever, residents of Abia State have braced up for the exercise even as police called on the people to ignore the order.\n\nMost residents of the state already see today as a public holiday as they bought most of what they would use on Monday, on Friday and Saturday.\n\nIn some churches across the state, yesterday, adherents were asked to remain at home as not to be victims of any clash between security agents and Biafra agitators.\n\nCommercial vehicle and tricycle operators spoken to said they would be off the streets in compliance with the order.\n\nAlthough, the state government did not issue order for closure of markets, some traders, who spoke to Daily Sun, said they would stay at home to avoid any trouble.\n\nDeal with troublemakers \u2013Delta CP\n\nCommissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammed Ali, yesterday, urged his officers to deal decisively with troublemakers in any part of the state.\n\nAli warned that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting Biafra flag in whatever guise in the state.\n\nHis warning is coming on the heels of the sit-at-home order for today by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAli, in a statement, yesterday, by the acting Public Relations Officer of the command, Bright Edafe, said undercover police detectives have been deployed across the state to arrest anyone caught carrying Biafra flag, and ensure they are dealt with accordance with the law of the land.",

All passengers are advised to avoid the long arm of the law and act in good conscience by adhering to the guidelines to protect the lives and livelihood of all Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the new guidelines and the ban on non-Nigerians travelling from three countries (India, Brazil and Turkey) into Nigeria, Lagos State has recorded 568 in-bound passengers, who have been permitted to enter Nigeria from these three countries. We have isolated 433 passengers in our various accredited hotels and facilities; 262 are in Isolation and 154 passengers have been discharged with a negative COVID-19 test.\n\n\u201cNine have tested positive to COVID-19 and successfully isolated to prevent community transmission. Of the remaining 135 passengers, 119 have refused isolation and 16 are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn May 24, 2021, the Presidential Steering Committee led by Mr. Boss Mustapha and working together with the COVID-19 response in Lagos State, led by the Incident Commander, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, published a first list of defaulters of the laid down protocols travelling through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport as it relates to the red listed countries (India, Brazil and Turkey).\n\n\u201cAll passengers affected should contact the lead of our Case Management Unit, Dr. Abimbola Bowale, on [email protected] who will verify their status. The list of names who may have been mistakenly placed on this list and have been cleared will be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee for removal from the published names.\n\n\u201cHowever, all passengers that have been confirmed absconders will have their passports deactivated for a minimum of 1 year, if Nigerian and if foreign, will have their resident permits cancelled and deported as stated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAll absconders will also face the penalties of the coronavirus pandemic Law 2021 of Lagos State, including varying lengths of prison time up to one year and fines of up to N500,000. All affected passengers are to present themselves to the Yaba Mainland Hospital for assessment and COVID-19 tests to evaluate their status.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner who warned against third wave of the COVID-19 wave, said regardless of the reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the state is yet to reach its target. \u201cGiven the requirement for achieving herd immunity (60 per cent of total population vaccinated), the state still needs to vaccinate about 14,000,000 (14 Million).\n\n\u201cHowever, the state would ensure ramp up testing by carrying out COVID-19 tests on all travelers.",

Imo State government must give an account of those who killed Gulak. The continuous killing of northerners and destruction of security facilities in Imo State will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nIt said government should take note that it would not allow the killers of Gulak go unpunished, stressing that the governor, who is the chief security officer, must bring those involved in the assassination to justice.\n\nThe group urged the Federal Government to rise to its constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and property and act appropriately to avoid the current situation from escalating to a civil war.\n\nBuhari outraged, says resources\u2019ll be deployed to fish out perpetrators\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed outrage and disgust over \u201cthe heinous murder\u201d of Gulak.\n\nIn a statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari vowed that resources would be deployed to fish out the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cLet me warn however that nobody or group of people who engages in such despicable acts should expect to go free.

They said the investigation has become necessary in the current circumstances as a result of the magnitude of recent attacks.\n\nIn a statement signed by chairman of the South East caucus, Ike Ekweremadu, Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, among others, siad majority of Igbo are opposed to any form of violence in furtherance of any cause.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cWe urge the Inspector General of Police to dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen determined to create a state of anarchy in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has become necessary in the circumstance because of the magnitude of the attacks. More so as the region had not witnessed such in the past.\n\n\u201cWe advise the security agencies to continue to show restraint in the discharge of its mission to restore peace in the Southeast. Security operatives must remember, at all times, that the majority of Igbos are opposed to any form of violence in furtherance of any cause.\n\n\u201cWe, the South-East Caucus of the NASS, as leaders and major stakeholders in the region, have observed with surprise the sudden spike in violence in the region known for its calm, love and peaceful disposition to visitors irrespective of tribe and religion.\n\n\u201cWe have had cause always to deploy the instrumentalities of the institution of state to alert the government of Nigeria about some of the vexed issues of injustice, inequity and obvious marginalisation of the South East in governance structure. Nonetheless, we have not lost hope that the authorities will eventually do the right thing for the continued peaceful coexistence of all people in a united Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we are worried over recent developments in the South East, which has thrown the zone into violence and confusion. Igbos are not known to kill or waste lives. Igbos are not known for this unfortunate violent disposition, no matter the provocation.\n\n\u201cWe note the increasing agitation for restructuring of Nigeria and increasing separatist agitations across the country due to perceived and real issues of marginalisation. On these issues, we, the leaders across board, have consistently cautioned that such agitations must be strictly in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and must be peaceful and devoid of violence.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Police allay fears as residents stockpile food items, others over sit-at-home order\n\nChristopher Isiguzo, Gideon Arinze in Enugu, Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki, Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nTension has enveloped the five states in the South-east as secessionist agitators ramped up attacks on security facilities and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) assets, in a fashion reminiscent of the onset of the Boko Haram insurgency that has now crippled the North-east.\n\nThe separatist agitations in the South-east is being championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which police and other security agencies have accused of waging a terror campaign in the South-east through its paramilitary organisation, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nHowever, the separatist group has serially disclaimed allegations of being behind the attacks on state institutions in the South-east.\n\nBoko Haram, founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf, to campaign against Western education and to seek the imposition of Islamic rule on Nigeria, had transmuted into a terror group about a year after the police killed its leader in July 2009.\n\nIt started its terror campaign with attacks on soft targets and progressed to assaulting police formations, including the Force Headquarters, Abuja, and the United Nations building, in Abuja.\n\nIn adopting the Boko Haram strategy, the separatists in the South-east, besides attacking police facilities in the South-east, have widened their targets to include INEC offices and the correctional facilities in the zone.\n\nInvestigation by THISDAY showed that many police stations and INEC offices and assets have been attacked in the zone in the past few months.\n\nIn Imo State, two INEC offices in Ahiazu Mbaise and Njaba LGA were attacked this year.\n\nThe police facilities attacked included the State Command Headquarters, Owerri, Orlu Police Station, Owerri Police Station, Njaba Divisional Headquarters, Okigwe South Area Command Headquarters, Mbaitoli Police Station and Umulowo Police Division in Obowo Local Government Area.\n\nIn Enugu State, the Separatists have attacked INEC offices, including Udenu LGA head office in Obollo Afor, state headquarters in Enugu and Igbo Eze South LGA headquarters.\n\nThey also attacked police stations in Ezeagu and Uzo Uwani.\n\nAlso, INEC offices attacked in Ebonyi State included the ones in Ezza North LGA, Ebonyi LGA and Izzi LGA.\n\nThe separatists have also attacked police stations such as CPS Abakaliki, Kpiripkiri Police Station, also in Abakaliki, Ekeabo Police Station, also in Abakakili, Onueke Police Station, Uburu Police Station in Ohaozora, Ezza North, Ebonyi LGA police station, Okposhi Police Station also in Ohaozora, the Police Divisional Headquarters in Isu, Onicha Local Government Area and Iboko Divisional Police Station in Izzi Local Government Area\n\nHowever, the only INEC office burnt in Abia State is in Ohafia.\n\nBut the separatists have attacked the following police stations: Abayi Divisional police Headquarters in Aba, Bende Divisional Headquarters, Apumiri Ubakala Police Station in Umuahia South, Mike Okiro Police Station, Omoba Police Station in Isiala Ngwa LGA and the state Police Criminal Investigation Department in Umuahia, the state capital, assaulted on Saturday.\n\nIn Anambra State, gunmen attacked the state headquarters of INEC in Awka, the state capital.\n\nThey also attacked Ekwulobia Police Station, Nanka; police checkpoint at Neni, Anaocha LGA; Obosi Police Station in Idemili North LGA; B Police Division in Awka; Ozubulu Police Station in Ekwusigo Local Government Area and zonal police headquarters in Ukpor, Dunukofia LGA.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the five states of Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi, at the weekend stockpiled foods and other necessities ahead of today\u2019s sit-at-home order issued by IPOB in honour of those who died during the Nigeria-Biafra Civil war.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that residents of the five states have been involved in panic-buying for fear of the unknown.\n\nIPOB had asked states in the South-east to observe a sit-at-home today in remembrance of gallant soldiers and others who lost their lives during the Biafran civil war.\n\nIn Enugu State, the police, however, have assured residents of the state that there is no cause for alarm as steps have been taken to ensure the protection of lives and property.\n\nBut the residents in the state over the weekend, trooped to the popular Ogbete market to shop for their various needs ahead of today\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the market on Friday and Saturday, there was a surge in the number of people who went to shop for food items and other needs.\n\nThose who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, said they were going to comply with the sit-at-home order.\n\nHowever, the Enugu State Police Command has asked residents of the state to disregard the sit-at-home order and to go about their normal business.\n\nIn a statement given to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Mr. Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, enjoined residents to disregard the order.\n\nHe warned any anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the peace in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt will be resisted.\n\nAliyu assured the residents of the commitment of the police to collaborate with other security agencies to guarantee public security and safety.\n\nHe called on parents and guardians as well as religious, traditional, town union, market, youth and other leaders to caution their subjects against allowing themselves to be used to cause trouble.\n\nHe also urged residents to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they go about their legitimate businesses, and promptly report criminal elements to the nearest police station.\n\nInvestigation revealed that there may be a compliance with the sit-at-home order in Ebonyi State, following the fear of possible attack on violators.\n\nA businessman who spoke to THISDAY that no one would risk his life to go to shop.\n\nMajority of residents who spoke on the directive said they would obey it.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, has threatened to seize any shop not opened for business in compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe governor also directed security agencies to protect Ebonyi people against attacks from non-state actors seeking to enforce compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cI have been getting voices from some agitators that tomorrow there will be no movement. This is foolishness. If there is no movement in South-east, will there be no movement in the whole country?\n\n\u201cWhat an Ebonyi man will never accept is to go into second slavery under any guise. We know the Biafra we need, it is to have money so that we can cleanse off the toga of slavery that our brothers and sisters subjected us into. If you love Ebonyi State, bring money, come and put up one construction.\n\n\u201cWe want to see your investment in Ebonyi State. I want to say there will be free movement throughout today, throughout tomorrow and going forward and I challenge the youths, security agencies, local government chairmen to ensure that nobody is molested.\u201d\n\nResidents of Abia State were also in a panic mode yesterday following the weekend attacks on the State Crime Investigation Department(CID) in Umuahia and the sit-at-home order.\n\nPeople barely managed to attend church services yesterday amidst the already tensed situation. They rushed home as soon as church services were over.\n\nPeople were seen drifting to Isi Gate, the only area of the city where they could buy household needs as regular markets and most shops do not usually open on Sundays.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring,\u201d said Nazi Uzoma Udoka, a resident of Umuahia as he waited with his family to board a tricycle home after the church service.\n\nHe told THISDAY that \u201cevery day comes with uncertainties\u201d adding that \u201cthese days when people go out in the morning, they find it very difficult to return home at the end of the day as ugly incident would have happened and cause the police to block the roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to comply with the stay-at-home order because if you venture out the outcome could be unpleasant,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, a Superintendent of Police, did not pick calls when THISDAY telephoned him to find out preparations to protect the people.\n\nThere was also tension in Anambra State over today\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Eke Awka market, a major market that serves the Anambra State capital and environs on Saturday, residents were seen making purchases of food items.\n\nMany residents were also seen yesterday at the same market in last-minute purchases.\n\nIn most churches in the state, residents were advised to heed the order, if not for anything, for them to be safe.\n\nBut the state police command has called on the people to disregard the order, saying it is doing all it can to protect the people.\n\nSpokesperson of the command, Toochukwu Ikenga, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, told THISDAY that, \u201cWe are not deterred with the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate in protecting lives and property. Just like any other day is, we shall continue to maintain law and order.\n\n\u201cWe (are) also encouraged by the support we have from the Anambra State Government, the citizens and especially Ndi Anambra. We urge them to sustain it. Together we shall police our state effectively.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, the Imo State capital, the residents observed partial sit-at-home during the weekend due to the worsening insecurity in the state.\n\nThe state police command had earlier warned IPOB fighters against disturbing the peace of the state.\n\nDon\u2019t Hoist \u2018Biafra Flag\u2019 in Delta, Police Warn IPOB\n\nAsaba, the Delta State capital, which shares boundary with Onitsha, the commercial city of Anambra State, was calm and peaceful yesterday.\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command has warned members of IPOB not to hoist the \u2018Biafran Flag\u2019 in any part of the state.\n\nThe command, while expressing its preparedness to maintain law and order, warned that its personnel would \u201cdeal ruthlessly\u201d with any attempt by the IPOB or similar groups to cause trouble in any part of Delta State.\n\nA statement by the Delta Police Command spokesman, Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ari Muhammed Ali, had ordered police personnel to be \u201con red alert\u201d because of the IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home directive.\n\n\u201cThe command is aware of the threat of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) and their intention of parading themselves in some parts of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Delta State, who is determined to maintain peace in the state, has urged officers and men of the state command to be on red alert, watchful, and deal decisively with the trouble makers.\n\n\u201cThe CP, therefore, warns that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting \u2018Biafra flag\u2019 in whatever guise in the state,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 other military personnel who died in the military plane crash in Kaduna on May 21.\n\nIt called on the military authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident to ascertain the actual cause of the crash.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says negotiations ongoing to acquire 20% stake in Dangote Refinery\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has served notice to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) that it will deduct about N126 billion from its remittance to the Federation Account at the next meeting scheduled for June.\n\nThis is coming as the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery has not been concluded.\n\nIn a report signed by NNPC\u2019s Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, a copy of which THISDAY obtained at the weekend, the corporation stated that subsequently, it will begin the subtraction of the balance of an additional N50 billion, being Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery to sustain crude oil production level.\n\nIn the document which detailed the status of the corporation\u2019s finances during its monthly FAAC meeting, which took place between May 19 and 20, the NNPC also confirmed that it did not make any remittance to the Federation Account during the period.\n\nThe development may further throw the three tiers of government, federal, states and local governments, into harsher times next month as they may get less from the Federation Account, as a result of the huge payment the NNPC is paying for subsidy on petrol.\n\nIn April, the corporation had notified the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, that it would not be able to remit any funds to the Federation Account in April for distribution in May.\n\nNNPC said it posted a value shortfall of N111.966 billion in February 2021, which would ultimately impact on its ability to contribute to the joint account shared among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe corporation attributed the N111.966 billion shortfall to the rising average landing cost of petrol, which jumped to N184 per litre in March as opposed to the existing N128 ex-coastal price.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the N111.966 billion incurred as landing cost would be deducted from April oil and gas proceeds due to the federation in May.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the impact on the federation was not as far-reaching as expected because the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), which collects royalties and bonuses on behalf of the federal government, came to the rescue with the remittance of about $500 million it received from the marginal fields it recently put up for bids.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had confirmed the role played by DPR in augmenting the FAAC allocation for April, which was shared in May.\n\nThe minister, however, did not disclose how much was paid into the account.\n\nBut the NNPC had in a reaction to the dust raised by the letter to the accountant general, stated that the corporation wasn\u2019t broke, adding that the zero revenue projection only had to do with the federation revenue stream, which it manages and not a general reflection of its overall financial performance.\n\nIn the fresh notice raised by the corporation to deduct N126 billion from its remittance in June, it said it was still shouldering the burden of the differentials from the sale of petrol, which it prefers to call \u201cunder-recovery\u201d.\n\nThe FAAC document added: \u201cNo remittance to Federation Account in April, 2021 (May, 2021 FAAC) due to recorded value shortfall resulting from difference between landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N61,966,456,903.74 was deducted out of the total March value shortfall of N111,966,456,903.74. This is to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level. The balance $50,000,000,000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, April value shortfall of N126,298,457,944.36 is to be deducted from May federation proceeds in June 2021 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nThe figures further showed that while a net revenue of N90.8 billion was remitted to FAAC in January, N64.1 billion was remitted in February, N41.1 billion was presented in March and zero amount recorded for April.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporation has said that it sold total oil and gas valued at $565.4 million or an equivalent of N214.5 billion in April, according to the document.\n\nNNPC stated that its overall crude oil lifting for both export and domestic in March 2021, recorded 29 per cent decrease relative to the 10.79Mbbls lifted in February 2021.\n\nThe national oil company said Nigeria maintained 1.52 million bpd OPEC production cut in the first quarter of 2021, while export crude oil revenue received in April amounted to $1.89 million, equivalent to N723 million.\n\n\u201cThis represents a 98 per cent decrease compared to March 2021. Domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.13bn,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stated that feedstock valued at $54.6 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.4 million was received during the month, with the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nMCA is a financing agreement whereby the International Oil Companies (IOCs) advance loans to NNPC to invest in upstream projects.\n\nFor other receipts, the corporation stated that $1.25 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in April 2021.\n\nThe data also showed that the exchange rate the CBN sold foreign exchange to the NNPC moved from N379 to N383.47, while N15 billion was spent on government priority projects.\n\nIn the same month, the corporation lost 3.1 million barrels for various reasons, ranging from shut-ins due to repairs, industrial actions, flow line leaks and power failure.\n\nOn the analysis of receipts due in April, gross revenue from JV crude was N124.3 billion, JV gas was N26.1 billion, while N5.8 billion was received from miscellaneous sources, amounting to N156.3 billion.\n\nAfter deduction of royalty, JV cost recovery, profit before tax and taxes, receipts from JV crude came down to N5.5 billion, while that of JV gas stood at N7.8 billion.\n\nOf the March domestic crude oil payable in June by the NNPC, in line with the 90-day payment plan, Chevron Nigeria Limited has roughly 2.89 million barrels valued at N72.6 billion while Eroton\u2019s share is 130,000 barrels valued at N3.1 billion.\n\nAlso, Mobil Producing has 2.84 million litres, valued at N68 billion, Seplat\u2019s is N3.36 billion, SPDC\u2019s share of the JV is N33.6 billion while the value of Total\u2019s crude oil payable in June is N3.1 billion, totalling approximately N184.5 billion or equivalent of $487 million.\n\nAs of March 31, total pre-2016 JV cash call arrears repayment status indicated that JV negotiated debt remained at $4.68 billion, total payment till date is $3.1 billion, while outstanding balance is $1.54 billion, with the exception of Mobil which has been fully paid by the NNPC.\n\nIn April, N938.9 million was spent on security and maintenance, while strategic holdings of the NNPC gulped N740 million, amounting to N1.679 billion.\n\nIn all, 37 vessels imported petrol for the month under review, with landing cost ranging from between N169 and N199.90. Also, a total of N1.48 billion litres were imported for the month, 1.99 billion litres were sold, with depot price remaining at N128 and the recorded loss put at N111.9 billion.\n\nNNPC: Negotiations Ongoing to Acquire Stake in Dangote Refinery,\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote has not been concluded.\n\nKyari, in a text message in response to enquiries by THISDAY on the matter, said the terms of the agreement were being finalised and could be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\nHe added that the NNPC is interested in acquiring a stake in any private refinery with a capacity in excess of 50,000 barrels per day and not just the Dangote Refinery alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Dangote Refinery acquisition, it\u2019s actually an ongoing negotiations that was disclosed by one of our executives. We haven\u2019t concluded; terms are being finalised and may be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to discuss the details at this point. However, the decision is for NNPC to expand her portfolio as is the common practice amongst national oil companies as matter of energy security considerations and risk management. We will take equity from any refinery that plans to process in excess of 50,000 barrels per day, not just the Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated Dangote Refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene, is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce about 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and four million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The aircraft crashed-landed the next day; the authorities are hiding the incident. The crash occurred in the morning. It was a solely military affair and they prevented anyone of us from taking photographs of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt crash-landed at the Akure airport two weeks ago but they hid it. About 15 to 20 personnel were on board to the South-East.\u201d\n\nIn about three months, the NAF jets have crashed in the North-Central, North-East, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and now South-West regions, raising fears about the maintenance culture of the military aircrafts.\n\nSaharaReporters last Friday reported that the families of two Nigerian Air Force pilots \u2013 Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele \u2013 are still in the dark about their loved ones onboard an Alpha Jet which went missing since March 31.\n\nSee Also Military Pains For Pilots\u2019 Families As Nigerian Air Force Fails To Locate Missing Alpha Jet After Two Months\n\nThe NAF has yet to provide an update on the location of the missing Alpha Jet NAF 475 which believably crashed on March 30 in Borno State as well as on the bodies of the late pilots, giving the families a great concern.\n\n\u201cThe families are in distress. Nobody is talking about the two pilots on the Alpha Jet. The NAF\u2019s investigation is taking forever. Now that another crash of bigger national importance has happened, the authorities may not even revert to the missing jet in Borno State, so as not to put up too many negativities into the public domain,\u201d a source had said.\n\nThe fighter jet went missing on Wednesday, March 30, around 5pm, amidst fears that it might have been captured or shot down by the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThe Alpha Jet, a light attack jet and advanced jet trainer aircraft, has played a significant role in Nigeria\u2019s counter-insurgency campaign in the North-East theatre of operation.\n\nIt was acquired by NAF in 2014 from the United States of America air force.\n\nThe last update the NAF gave was on April 2, when the NAF authorities said that intelligence gathered so far indicated that the jet might have crashed although it had yet to know the whereabouts of the jet or the two pilots on board.\n\nMilitary sources had said at that time that the jet crashed in the Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State, although the NAF did not confirm the location.\n\nIt will be recalled that in February 2021, a NAF Beechcraft King Air 350i Surveillance Aircraft also crashed in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe outcome of NAF\u2019s supposed investigations into the crash had yet to be made public.",

The aircraft crashed-landed the next day; the authorities are hiding the incident. The crash occurred in the morning. It was a solely military affair and they prevented anyone of us from taking photographs of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt crash-landed at the Akure airport two weeks ago but they hid it. About 15 to 20 personnel were on board to the South-East.\u201d\n\nIn about three months, the NAF jets have crashed in the North-Central, North-East, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and now South-West regions, raising fears about the maintenance culture of the military aircrafts.\n\nSaharaReporters last Friday reported that the families of two Nigerian Air Force pilots \u2013 Flight Lieutenant John Abolarinwa and Flight Lieutenant Ebiakpo Chapele \u2013 are still in the dark about their loved ones onboard an Alpha Jet which went missing since March 31.\n\nSee Also Military Pains For Pilots\u2019 Families As Nigerian Air Force Fails To Locate Missing Alpha Jet After Two Months\n\nThe NAF has yet to provide an update on the location of the missing Alpha Jet NAF 475 which believably crashed on March 30 in Borno State as well as on the bodies of the late pilots, giving the families a great concern.\n\n\u201cThe families are in distress. Nobody is talking about the two pilots on the Alpha Jet. The NAF\u2019s investigation is taking forever. Now that another crash of bigger national importance has happened, the authorities may not even revert to the missing jet in Borno State, so as not to put up too many negativities into the public domain,\u201d a source had said.\n\nThe fighter jet went missing on Wednesday, March 30, around 5pm, amidst fears that it might have been captured or shot down by the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThe Alpha Jet, a light attack jet and advanced jet trainer aircraft, has played a significant role in Nigeria\u2019s counter-insurgency campaign in the North-East theatre of operation.\n\nIt was acquired by NAF in 2014 from the United States of America air force.\n\nThe last update the NAF gave was on April 2, when the NAF authorities said that intelligence gathered so far indicated that the jet might have crashed although it had yet to know the whereabouts of the jet or the two pilots on board.\n\nMilitary sources had said at that time that the jet crashed in the Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State, although the NAF did not confirm the location.\n\nIt will be recalled that in February 2021, a NAF Beechcraft King Air 350i Surveillance Aircraft also crashed in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe outcome of NAF\u2019s supposed investigations into the crash had yet to be made public.",

          "text": "Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa, has raised $6.5m in a Series B round led by Partech from its Africa Fund.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2016 when Ihad Fikry and Ibrahim Kamel decided there was a need to cater to the learning needs in the MENA region that were not provided by other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe live in a region with a population of 400 million-plus people but 90% of them cannot learn properly in any other language but Arabic,\u201d Ihab Fikry, Almentor\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says to TechCabal.\n\nThe courses are designed to provide knowledge \u201cin a proper manner without promoting any ideology or religious thoughts,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHow Almentor works\n\nFrom gamified mobile apps to websites that enable streaming, online learning comes in different varieties across the world.\n\nHundreds of educational channels like TED-Ed, Khan Academy and Crash Course have carved a niche on YouTube, without having to build their own technologies. Where does Almentor fit in this universe?\n\nAlmentor can be accessed in multiple countries across Africa but the content is focused on North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFikry describes Almentor as sharing the attributes of renowned platforms like Masterclass, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.\n\nIt charges users a subscription to access its library of 12,000 videos.\n\nThe platform has a video-on-demand component that enables learners to stream content, while a learning management system engages users in classroom-like activities like asking and answering questions, and taking exams.\n\nAlmentor can be accessed anywhere, even in Nigeria, but the focus is to serve the Arabic region.\n\nTheir library includes math, history, natural sciences and training material for corporations. For social sciences where context may vary between countries, creators are selected from various countries to ensure the material is relevant. However, many users can find similarities because virtually every course is available in Arabic.\n\nAlmentor works with subject-matter teachers and professional content creators around the MENA region to create the courses. The company and the creators share revenue from subscriptions based on an agreement on exclusivity and whole ownership of the content by Almentor.\n\nFikry says they have received over 3,000 applications from people who want to create course material on Almentor, but the acceptance rate is currently at 12%. Besides welcoming applications, the startup proactively headhunts already successful lecturers and also engages agencies to recruit mentors for them.\n\nSo far, Almentor has provided 2 million successful learning experiences to users. Fikry explains this metric means the learner has consumed at least 25% of the learning material.\n\nLearning categories vary from basic (30% of their library) to intermediate and advanced levels.\n\nA typical Almentor learner is between ages 18 and 40 years old. 51% of learners are male while 49% are female. 60% are from Egypt, 25% are from Gulf nations like Saudia Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. The rest come from Algeria, Morocco, Niger and Arabs living in the US and UK.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic status, Fikry says Almentor learners are between the middle and upper class.\n\n\u201cFor those in Class A+, they prefer to learn in English though some learn in French. For others, almost 40% can only learn in Arabic,\u201d Fikry, a PhD holder who used to be a management professor and PWC consultant, explains.\n\nSeed to Series B, driven by partnerships\n\nAs much as it is a service targeted as directly serving consumers, a key element of Almentor\u2019s progress has been over 80 partnerships it has entered with organisations and governments.\n\nOne such partnership is with the Ministry of Education in Egypt for a white-label curriculum targeted at 4.5 million students in grades 7 to 9. They have another with the government in the UAE to upskill entrepreneurs in the region.\n\nRegardless of the country or the partnership, Almentor\u2019s promise is that users will \u201clearn from a subject matter expert without being driven to any ideology,\u201d Fikry insists.\n\nIt is a sophisticated commitment that requires a range of management skills, beyond merely setting up technology for streaming and learning. It also needs capital to achieve its potential, Fikry says, which explains why they have sought out investors to continue to build.\n\nAs with having governments on board, working with VCs \u201cgives credibility to the platform as we are serving an area with lots of dynamics,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHe says they particularly sought out Partech for this round owing to the VC\u2019s global spread of portfolio companies spanning fintech, edtech and other sectors.\n\nWith this Series B, Almentor has now raised $14.5 million.\n\nIt opened the funding gates with a $3.5 million seed fund in 2016. In 2019, Almentor\u2019s $4.5 million Series A was led by Sawari Ventures, an Egyptian firm that closed a $71 million fund in April. Sawari also invested in this Series B round as Sango Capital, a firm based in South Africa.\n\nCyril Collon, general partner at Partech, described Fikry and his co-founder as \u201ctwo fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nHe believes Almentor is the leading platform for self-learning in the Middle East and Africa, and is looking forward to helping the company expand access to \u201con-demand cutting-edge personal learning & developments options.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely seven months after a $30 million funding round in which Jeff Bezos participated, Chipper Cash has raised $100 million in a Series C round.\n\nThe round was led by SVB Capital, a US firm investing in an Africa-focused startup for the first time. Existing Chipper Cash investors like Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions and 500 Startups participated. One Way Ventures, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures also joined the round.\n\nChipper Cash enables individuals to transfer money at zero fees between African countries. It also offers Chipper Checkout, a paid service for businesses to receive payments by sharing payment links with customers or integrating a button on a website or app.\n\nBefore now, the startup was present in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. But Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch they have now made their services available in the UK.\n\nThis expansion comes on the heels of a 33% increase in users \u2013 from 3 million in November 2020 to 4 million at present. Within this period, the company introduced new features to its app including virtual VISA cards for online shopping in Nigeria and crypto transactions in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nThis Series C marks a stunning rise for a three-year-old startup. It was founded in 2018 by Serunjogi, a Ugandan, and Maijid Moujaled, a Ghanaian. Three years later, the pair has steered the company to the top bracket of fintech startups on the continent, at least in terms of the amount of venture capital raised.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nSince May 2019 when they raised $2.4m, the startup\u2019s total funding stands at $152.2m. Serunjogi, the Chipper Cash CEO, declined to be specific about what the startup is now worth.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not getting into our valuation, but we\u2019re probably the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round,\u201d he said.\n\nMaijid Moujaled (seated) and Ham Serunjogi, Chipper Cash co-founders\n\nIn March this year, Flutterwave \u2013 a private startup in Africa \u2013 raised $170m and explicitly said they were now valued at more than $1bn. Segunjogi\u2019s comment suggests that Chipper Cash may also now be worth over $1bn, even if they have raised $80m less than the Nigerian fintech.\n\nLike Flutterwave, Chipper Cash is headquartered in San Francisco but has over 200 employees working out of Africa and serving African customers.

Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT Hello, On Tuesday, Stripe announced a feature for merchants to create payment links and sell online without a website. As with many things from Stripe, it sounded unparalleled \u2013 another \u201cgame-changer\u201d in global e-payments. But allow Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s CEO, tell you where the proof of concept came from: \u201c\u2026the thing that\u2019s interesting to me about the payment link \u201cspace\u201d is that it\u2019s a use case that really took off in other markets first \u2014 Nigeria, India, Philippines, etc. I suspect that staying abreast of important new patterns emerging outside US/Europe will become more important for many businesses in the years ahead\u2026\u201d Payments links is one example of how emerging markets can teach developed economies a few tricks for the digital economy. Another space where Nigeria\u2019s example may influence the global space is real-time payments, as we\u2019ll see shortly after a message from our partners. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive in. Exporting e-payments One consequence of last year\u2019s pandemic was a sharp increase in the use of mobile wallets. According to a new report by ACI Worldwide, an American payments system company, mobile wallet adoption increased by 46% in 2020. Growth in 2019 was 40.6% while the mark for 2018 was 18.9%. This trend suggests that payments is becoming: more mobile: through apps available on smartphones, smart watches, etc and less in physical bank branches.\n\nfaster: if people are more confident to make payments online, it must be because both sender and receiver are getting notified of transaction success more quickly too. Indeed, online payments are becoming more real-time around the world. Real-time transaction volumes increased by 41% from 50 billion in 2019 to 70.3 billion in 2020. Transaction value rose by 32.8% from $69 trillion to $92 trillion. So which countries are driving this trend?\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights With 25.5 billion transactions in 2020, India is by far the global leader on real-time payments. China, South Korea, Thailand and the UK make up the top five.\n\nIndia\u2019s real-time payments revolution started in 2016 when the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched. They\u2019ve gone on to build an Immediate Payment System. But before all this, Nigeria made a similar historic move with NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP) in 2011.\n\nNIP is a real-time payment solution that guarantees instant value to beneficiaries. NIBSS (Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme, a company co-owned by banks in Nigeria) built E-bills Pay on the NIP platform to enable account-to-account payments.\n\nBoth creations have been described as part of the foundations for Nigeria\u2019s fintech boom today. Andrew Levin, the chief economics for PwC in Nigeria once called NIBSS the most impactful fintech in Nigeria. What NIBSS did in 2011, many are still in the process of creating. The US\u2019s first real-time payment network is barely four years old. Instant transfers through that network only became available on PayPal\u2019s Venmo in August 2019. The US Federal Reserve Bank plans to launch FedNow, a NIBSS NIP of sorts, in 2023.\n\nBut as good as NIBSS has been in Nigeria, some fintechs are already looking to go further in making transactions more real-time and unifying payments.\n\nTeamApt, a startup founded in 2015, introduced a \u201cvirtual account\u201d system that has become a standard for instant transfers among Nigerian fintechs. This year, a new startup has come out of beta to provide instant settlement for businesses. It is already being called \u201cNIBSS for fintechs.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Nigeria does not have India or China\u2019s population to top real-time payments lists. Nigerian consumers may not be at the income levels in economies like South Korea and the UK. But as Collison said, the West African country is a place to watch for trends that could shape the future of online payments. FROM THE CABAL Nigeria-based fintech OPay is said to be plotting a $400 million fundraise that will see it valued at $1.5 billion. The money will be deployed to deepend its impressive payments processing operation in Nigeria and expansion elsewhere. There\u2019s that will see it valued at $1.5 billion.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "African cross-border payments startup, Chipper Cash has raised a $100 million Series C led by US-based Venture Capital (VC) firm, SVB Capital.\n\nThe three-year-old startup, founded by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018, offers mobile-based, no fee, P2P cross-border payment services, across up to seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya.\n\nPer Techcrunch, the company has also expanded to the UK, the first country it has expanded to outside Africa.\n\nThe company says it plans to use the latest round to introduce more products and grow its team.\n\nRecall that in 2019, the startup raised $8.4 million in two seed rounds, in June 2020 it followed this by raising $13.8m Series A led by Deciens Capital, and by November 2020, it closed a whopping $30m Series B led by Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions.\n\nIt is, perhaps, noteworthy that Chipper Cash has raised up to $152 million in just two years.\n\nLike Bezos Expeditions and Ribbit Capital in the previous round, this will be SVB\u2019s first investment in the African market.\n\nWhile he doesn\u2019t exactly confirm the startup\u2019s unicorn status, Serunjogi tells TechCrunch that Chipper Cash is likely the most valuable private startup in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Flutterwave (a private startup) valued at over $1billion and Jumia (a public company) currently valued at $2.6 billion, this should put Chipper Cash\u2019s valuation anywhere between $1 billion and $2.5 billion.\n\nHowever, Serunjogi refuses to focus on valuations, and would rather set his sights on growing his team and launching interesting new products.\n\nSource: Techcrunch\n\nAs of June 2020, the company stated that it plans to hire over a hundred staff in addition to its 200-man strong workforce. Its users have reportedly increased to 4 million, up 33% from last year. While it claimed to process 80,000 daily transactions in November its current transaction volumes have not been disclosed.\n\nAs for products, the company seems to be planning other products in addition to the crypto platform it launched in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said to TechCrunch.\n\nInterestingly, this comes at a time when Nigeria\u2019s Securities Regulator is planning to bring some form of regulations for Investment-tech platforms that also offer US stocks like Chaka, Bamboo, and Trove.\n\nBut, Serunjogi claims the company is already engaging regulators ahead, and like Flutterwave\u2019s CEO, Gbenga Agboola, he commended regulators like the Central Bank of Nigeria for fostering innovation in the fintech sector.\n\nNonetheless, Chipper Cash is playing in the cross-border payments space that has been historically difficult to crack.\n\nPer the World Bank, sending money within and to Africa remains the world\u2019s most expensive, and that has likely led several people to embrace cryptocurrency.\n\nThough Chipper Cash says it has launched its crypto product, it may no longer be able to directly serve the Nigerian market following the CBN\u2019s move to ban financial institutions from facilitating crypto transactions.\n\nBeing unable to directly facilitate crypto transactions in Nigeria, could offering US stocks with a seemingly lenient SEC be the next best thing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the bright side, Chipper Cash joins the ranks of Jumia, Fawry, Interswitch and Flutterwave as African unicorns in record time. If reports from The Information are to be believed, Nigerian fintech, OPay, could be joining them anytime soon.\n\nFeatured Image Source: TechCrunch\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s NAFEX adoption may be long walk from full unification -",
          "text": "The move by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Tuesday that saw the regulator adopt the NAFEX rate of N410.25 per US dollar on its website received accolades from many industry players as they tagged it a \u2018major step\u2019 towards full exchange rate unification.\n\nBut, analysts say though commendable, it was nothing more than recognising what was due for recognition as more than 90 percent of economic transactions were already using the rate long before it was updated on Tuesday.\n\nThe government had since March adopted the Investors and Exporters window rate (also known as the NAFEX rate) for government transactions, the CBN retained the old N379 per dollar official rate on its website, which created some confusion for investors.\n\nThe CBN pulled down the rate two weeks ago and has followed that action up by officially adopting the I&E window rate on its website where the naira is quoted at a weaker rate of N410.25 per dollar.\n\nIssues around liquidity and restriction on dollar deposits and usage are bigger challenges to full unification than merely recognising an overdue update on the CBN website, analysts said.\n\n\u201cI would not expect any significant impact on the economy,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, investment research analyst at United Capital, said.\n\nRead Also: BDCs tell public to patronize CBN-licenced operators\n\nNigeria, unlike it African peers has continued to operate multiple exchange rate window. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Presidential Economic Advisory Council hold the view that ditching the multiple exchange rate practice, which Nigeria started in 2016 in reaction to lower oil prices, will open up the economy to badly-needed investments.\n\nA Lagos-based economist believes the efforts at regulation of use only create artificial scarcity and ultimately keeps driving the rate down against the dollar.\n\n\u201cInstead of a gradual merge, liberalise the market- allow cash dollars paid into domiciliary accounts for payments and transfers. In no more than 6 months all the noise and speculation will disappear,\u201d an analyst who pleaded anonymity said.\n\nAccording to him, if the market is liberalised the naira will settle at its true value, which is higher than the current NAFEX rate.\n\nThe gap between the CBN official exchange rate and the parallel market, the rate at which most Nigerians access the dollar deepened on Wednesday following the speculation from the recent move by the apex bank.\n\nNaira fell in the parallel market to its lowest level in five months at N493 per dollar on Wednesday, the weakest since November 30, 2020, when the currency depreciated to N510/$.\n\nData collated from the black market implies a gap of N83 between the now official NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate.\n\n\u201cThere is so much cash dollars in the economy but people cannot use it except for no more than $5,000. Even that with so many restrictions,\u201d another analyst who asked not to be quoted said.\n\nAs part of its efforts to curtail demand for forex and reduce the utilization of the banking system to facilitate black market dealing in forex, the apex bank, in a guideline issued last year reduced the amount of cash dollar deposit in domiciliary accounts by 50 percent from $10,000 to $5,000 monthly.\n\nBut despite its effort to curtail the demand for the dollar, the policy by the apex bank has failed to yield result as the value of the naira has continued to depreciate. CBN devalue the currency on two occasions last year.\n\nThe naira at the CBN\u2019s FX window has depreciated by an average of 7.7 percent annually in the last ten years, according to Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nThe continuous devaluation of the naira is a key concern for both local and foreign investors who are looking to preserve the purchasing power of their savings and investment. Foreign investors have had their money trapped in Nigeria\u2019s debt market since March 2020 amid dollar shortage.\n\nDollar supply challenges in Nigeria come from its dependency on the foreign earnings from crude oil which has continued to account for over 90 percent of the export of Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although on the rise, the falling global crude price always reduces FX supply in Nigeria and affect exchange rate like in 2020 and 2016.\n\n\u201cTo have stable currency Nigeria must diversify the sources of its FX supply,\u201d Ebo said.",

          "text": "You have your customer\u2019s attention, here\u2019s how to use it\n\nCreating value, engaging with customers and understanding data are key ways experts have said brands can keep customers attention in a hugely competitive business world.\n\nSpeaking during the second Businessday Masters of Marketing conference, Yinka Adebayo, executive director, Media Investment OMG Weca, said in growing a successful brand, the value proposition cannot be compromised.\n\n\u201cAlthough the pandemic hit many businesses, some companies have leveraged on this opportunity and have created products which are still serving consumers while some other brands have gone out of business within the same time. It is about being more creative and innovative,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\nAt the conference, marketing experts reiterated the need to deploy data optimization, innovation and engaging content to achieve impactful marketing objectives for brands post pandemic.\n\nSpeaking during the second panel session which focused on \u201cRewriting the playbook: Stories from the frontlines of direct-to-consumer marketing\u201d, Otome Uyo, Client Service & Strategy EXP Marketing, said a lot of ideas and activities that used to be revered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had been displaced by the new normal, hence the modification of marketing is in tow.\n\nRead Also: NIPCO\u2019s scorecard shows gas business resilience despite COVID-19\n\nUltimately, activities will hinge on the hybrid approach even when everything reverts to the pre-pandemic way of life because the new normal enforced by the pandemic has an upside giving people the opportunity to be present anywhere and anytime virtually, he said.\n\n\u201cMarketing and products still involve human conversation, however how products are delivered, mode of operations and engagement as well as other crucial marketing variables have changed and this change will still continue hence brands need to find new and interesting ways to connect to consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nA study conducted by Microsoft in 2000 measured how long people focus on one thing for a specific amount of time. The results showed the average person\u2019s attention span was 12 seconds. About 15 years later, it dropped to 8 seconds.\n\nOge Maduagwu, media manager at Unilever West Africa, pointed out that brands must get to the point where whatever message they want to pass across must be done very fast and they must work twice as hard to make their products top notch and relatable.\n\n\u201cI have heard people say content is king but I say storytelling is the kingmaker. It is about telling your story in such a way that it bolsters memorability and brand power,\u201d Maduagwu said.\n\nShe also mentioned that brands must have distinctive assets and key cues within their assets so that without a full-length advertisement, people can relate with your content. It could be a logo or a song that makes your brand stick in people\u2019s mind, like Coca Cola adverts.\n\n\u201cYou must remain salient, because if you don\u2019t remain on air, people will forget you,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts also pointed out that businesses must also be willing to engage in difficult conversations such as gender inequality and other trending issues even though they must tread with caution.\n\nSandra Amachree, senior media & brand PR manager, Nigerian Breweries, said companies need to see this as an opportunity to share their values with their consumers.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to take note that on issues like this there are for and against. So it is not about taking sides but organisations must be willing to do a thorough research and get into the roots of the matter and how it affects people,\u201d Amachree said.\n\nAlero Ladipo, head, Marketing & Customer Experience Old Mutual Nigeria also explained that brands should not just see themselves as an end product but they must be a golden thread that runs through the entire process of servicing their customers.\n\nLadipo also emphasized that it is important for organisations to understand data and tell the story to stakeholders. \u201cBreak it down, decipher it and apply accordingly. it is also important to help your organisation understand the data as well.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that it is important for organisations to pick the right partners and agencies as they will need their assistance over time.\n\nDuring the conference, Ifeoma Dozie, director, marketing/communications SSA Mastercard, made a presentation that showed how Mastercard had evolved over time, its growth strategy and their core focus for the future.\n\nDozie explained that Mastercard now ranked 10th among the best companies in the world following top companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Apple and Coca Cola. This is a huge fit considering it ranked 87th position 10 years ago.\n\nMastercard has gone from storytelling to story making, and has now evolved to story inspiring which is empowering consumers to find the right path for them, she said.\n\n\u201cCustomers want brands that make a meaningful difference in their lives and want to make the world a better place, when they find brands that are able to do that, it will impact their buying decision,\u201d she said.\n\nDozie, making reference to a book \u2018Quantum Marketing\u2019 by Raja Rajamannar also mentioned that marketing should be both a science and an art. The new marketing mindset should be a combination of understanding data, Return on Investment (ROI), understanding bottom line as well as staying innovative and creative in a changing world. Mastercard also has inclusive initiatives such as financial inclusion, women empowerment and green coalition for impact.\n\nHowever, Uyo advised that while proffering solutions to needs, it was necessary for companies to anticipate consumer\u2019s needs and strategize ahead to meet those needs, adding that brands need to revamp their method of communication and marketing to something concise, relatable and interesting.\n\n\u201cFinding basic human truths, turning them into messages that your brand can support, and delivering them in the most powerful way is important. Beyond that consistency is key in order to remain remembered,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) have decried the deplorable conditions at the airport control towers across the nation\u2019s airports including Katsina, Kano, Sokoto and Calabar among other aerodromes saying that no airport in the country has up to 80 percent functioning equipment\n\nThis is as they revealed that Kaduna airport has no control tower to navigate the airlines.\n\nThey disclosed that the country needs no fewer than 650 controllers nationwide to meet the needs of existing and new airports popping up. The Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) employs over 4000 staff of which the core professionals are less than 400, which they say is inadequate to meet present needs.\n\nPresident of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), Abayomi Agoro, alongside his team revealed these in a press briefing, disclosed the lack of a control tower at the Kaduna Airport to lack of a urinary system at the Katsina control tower and failed equipment in Kano stressing that ATCs bear the brunt of the dilapidated system.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe working environment is becoming deplorable. Some airports do not even have functioning equipment. Kaduna does not have a control tower, what they are using there is a watch room (for firefighters) which is not built for that purpose and we have been calling on the government to do something, we go to Sokoto, once it rains, controllers will go to look for umbrellas to sit at the control tower.\n\n\u201cSome of the control towers attached to the terminal buildings were ceded to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) while those standing alone were with NAMA but we have approached the two organizations. just like the lift too, NAMA waits for FAAN to put the lift in order. All these happen as s result of bureaucracy and controllers bear the brunt.\n\n\u201cWe are still battling with terrestrial radio frequency and communication. Calabar also had its own challenges. No airport has all the needed equipment.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, deputy vice president NATCA, Ahmed Adamu Bello expressed dismay at the working conditions in Katsina airport.\n\nFor Katsina airport, Bello said there was no system to answer nature\u2019s call unless the ATC left the building which would be a breach of professional ethics.\n\nBello said,\u201d In Katsina, we have a one-man watch and there is no restroom. He is a human being and may feel the need to urinate at some point and if he descends from the tower, it is a breach of his professional ethics. So, what do you expect that person to do?\u201d\n\nOn Kano, he said,\u201d Kano has a fine building but facilities inside is a failure. We are angry because if the system demands I put my whole life into it, I expect the system to provide me with the working tools to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NATCA President, the Federal Government is allocating money, NAMA also generates money but said he was confused as to where these monies are going as nothing is being touched or improved upon in the towers.\n\nOn staff strength of ATCs nationwide and the impending workload Agoro said it was shameful that NAMA could not employ core professionals in the critical areas who are needed to do the job stating that even as there is a lack of ATCs, redundant staff are sitting while collecting money for doing nothing.\n\nAgoro said,\u201d We should have at least 600 to 650 ATCs because you cannot leave one controller on duty in the tower, it is dangerous.\n\nHe said Kaduna for instance has less than six ATCs yet NAMA has close to 4,000 staff.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbidemi Rufai, a suspended aide of Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, is to be arraigned on fraud charges before a United States Courthouse, in Tacoma, Washington, on June 8, 2021, PREMIUM TIMES reports.\n\nHe will appear before Theresa Fricke, a U.S. magistrate.\n\nThis development comes after a federal grand jury ratified the charges involving conspiracy, wire fraud and \u201caggravated identity theft\u201d. He allegedly used the identity theft as a scheme \u201cto steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department.\u201d\n\nA grand jury in the U.S. is a group of citizens empowered by law to conduct legal proceedings, investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought.\n\nThis newspaper reported that nine counts of wire fraud and five counts of aggravated identity theft were ratified by the grand jury against Mr Rufai.\n\nActing Attorney, Tessa Gorman, in a letter seen by this newspaper on Monday, informed the suspect\u2019s lawyers, Lance Hester and Michael Barrows, that Mr Rufai would be arraigned by 9:00 a.m. on June 8, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt will be necessary that you and your client be present at the time and place indicated above, or via video or teleconference as directed by the Court. The indictment and other documents related to this case are available on the Court\u2019s Electronic Docketing System,\u201d the letter partly read.\n\nGenesis\n\nMr Rufai was nabbed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York while heading to Nigeria on May 14.\n\nHe was said to have used the identities of more than 100 Washington residents to steal more than $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD) during the COVID-19 pandemic last year.\n\nAt the end of a detention hearing held on May 19, 2021, the Magistrate of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Ramon Reyes, agreed with the government that Mr Rufai posed \u201ca serious flight risk\u201d, but found that the risk could be addressed by conditions of release, including a $300,000 bond.\n\nThe magistrate went on to issue an order releasing Mr Rufai based on the bond in which Mr Rufai\u2019s brother, who is licensed as an attorney in New York, was proposed as surety.\n\nControversy\n\nMr Rufai was not released because his brother did not sign the bail bond. The suspect was then remanded pending when he would provide an alternate surety.\n\nFollowing the refusal of Mr Rufai\u2019s brother to stand as a surety, the defendant\u2019s lawyer, Michael Barrows, on May 21, presented Nekpen Soyemi, a registered nurse, whose family comes from Nigeria.\n\nThe U.S. later exposed her as a \u201csuspect in an investigation into an email impersonation scheme.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Idris Soyemi, is also said to have been convicted for wire fraud in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. government on May 24 filed an emergency motion of stay release order before the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma.\n\nLast Tuesday, the judge, Benjamin Settle, granted the government\u2019s motion to stay the release of Mr Rufai as the U.S. uncovered more criminal activities involving the suspect.",

Nonetheless, we have not lost hope that the authorities will eventually do the right thing for the continued peaceful coexistence of all people in a united Nigeria.\n\nHowever, we are worried over recent developments in the South East, which has thrown the zone into violence and confusion.\n\nIgbos are not known to kill or waste lives. Igbos are not known for this unfortunate violent disposition, no matter the provocation.\n\nWe note the increasing agitation for restructuring of Nigeria and increasing separatist agitations across the country due to perceived and real issues of marginalisation. On these issues, we, the leaders across-board, have consistently cautioned that such agitations must be strictly in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and must be peaceful and devoid of violence.\n\nThe Southeast Caucus of NASS commiserates with all who have lost loved ones, friends and colleagues in these unfortunate incidents and trust that our great country is resilient enough to weather and survive the current challenges confronting it.\n\nWe therefore condemn in its totality all forms of violence and killings under any guise. It is unacceptable and must never, for whatever reason, be condoned.\n\nWe urge the Inspector General of Police to dig deep in his investigations to unravel the actual identities of these unknown gunmen determined to create a state of anarchy in the Southeast.\n\nThe investigation has become necessary in the circumstance because of the magnitude of the attacks. More so as the region had not witnessed such in the past.\n\nWe advise the security agencies to continue to show restraint in the discharge of its mission to restore peace in the Southeast.

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe Federal Government is in a dilemma on how to remove fuel subsidy without attracting a public outcry and stiff opposition from the labour.\n\nFaced with dwindling revenues and inability to fund the over N13 trillion 2021 budget, the Federal Government had made several attempts to fully deregulate the downstream oil but has not been able to due to lack of political will and fear of a possible backlash from labour.\n\nThe government succeeded in increasing price from N121.50 to N123.50 per litre in June; N140.80 to N143.80 in July and N148 to N150 in August 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, goverment again pushed the pump price of petrol to N158 and N162, but met stiff opposition when it tried to effect another price hike in December of the same year .\n\nWith the attempt to remove subsidy stalled for over five months, government received a major boost when the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) recommended a petrol price of N408.5 per litre per litre.\n\nWhile presenting the report of the committee to the NGF, a committee chaired by Governor Nazir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said the current subsidy regime was unsustainable. According to him, the removal of subsidies should be immediate to save the nations economy.\n\nBetween N70billion and N210billion is estimated to be spent every month to keep gasoline price at N162 per litre, this is below the cost price and the remittance to the federation account will shrink to less than N50biillion per month or even zero if threats persist.\n\nWe are already at zero. I understand for tomorrow, so this scenario has occurred. Why are we keeping the price at N162? We are keeping the price because the Federal Government and trade unions met and agreed to the suspension of some industrial action months back.\n\nEven though we all supported deregulation of petroleum products prices last year, this agreement was suspended by the Federal Government because of a threat of industrial action by unions. This is the root of the problem and now we are back to losing between N70bn to N210bn per month.\n\nThe committee recommends PMS pump price increment from the current N162per litre to N408.5 per litre and (negotiations with organized labour unions). N380per litre (settlement with organized labour)\u201d, El-Rufai had stated.\n\nThe governors present adopted the report and passed it to the president for implementation.\n\nHowever, Business Hallmark findings revealed that the government, for fear of backlash from labour unions, might continue to bear the burden of about N225.50 subsidy on each litre of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) imported into the country by the NNPC.\n\nHardly had the governors came up with the recommendation to jack up the price of petrol that the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) threatened to shut the nation without notice should the government increase the pump price of petrol with a kobo as clamoured by governors.\n\nIn a communique at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting, the NLC said its leaders viewed the proposal by the NGF for a 300 percent increase in the price of petrol as the height of provocation, arbitrariness, detachment and insensitivity to the current economic realities in the country and the extreme hardship that Nigerians, especially workers were going through.\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba and acting General Secretary, Ishmail Bello, the NLC said: NEC also noted that there is currently no negotiation with government over fuel price increase. The NEC recalled that the last meeting with Government in February 2021 was adjourned sine die. Since then, no other meeting has been called by government. The NEC recalled and reiterated the decision it took on February 17, 2021, after the last meeting between labour and the Federal Government team on fuel price increase.\n\nThe NEC reiterated that it still stands solidly by its decision taken at its meeting which took place on 17th February 2021 to reject further increases in the price of refined petroleum products particularly the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS); The NEC also re-echoed its decision that the only sustainable way out of the crisis of fuel importation and associated dislocations in the downstream petroleum sub sector is for government to rehabilitate all four public refineries in Nigeria and build new ones;\n\nThe NEC resolved that any decision to increase by even one cent the price of refined petroleum products especially PMS will attract an immediate withdrawal of services by Nigerian workers all over the country without any further notice; and NEC resolved to write officially to the Federal Government of Nigeria conveying the plight of Nigerian workers, the concerns of Congress and the resolutions of the NEC on the matter of fresh proposals for an increase in the pump price of fuel especially as informed by the stance of the Nigeria Governors Forum, warned.\n\nWhile the government and the labour are busy squabbling, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said the outcome of governments discussion with labour on subsidy withdrawall will guide it in taking a position on the controversial issue.\n\nNNPC\u2019s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, said the corporation is awaiting the resolution of the government/labour talks, but will continue to retain the current ex-depot price, pending the directive from the Federal Government.\n\nThe GMD made everything clear as to the real situation and the position of things. If it was left to us, we (NNPC) would like to recover the full cost of production. But, the government wants to carry labour along and reach an amicable resolution of the issue as to how it will be done.\n\nThey want to come into agreement as to how deregulation will be effective. So, we (NNPC) are just waiting. But, we will continue to charge the same price.\n\nSo, our ex-depot price will remain until such as agreement is reached. We are just waiting for them to come to that amicable resolution. Once it is communicated to us, we take the next steps, Obateru stated.\n\nWhile commenting on the logjam, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), National Vice President, Abubakar Maigandi, said members of his association were ready to comply with the federal government/labour decision.\n\nWhatever the government resolves with the Labour, we are ready to accept provided the product is available nationwide.",
          "summary": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWAThe Federal Government is in a dilemma on how to remove fuel subsidy without attracting a public outcry and stiff opposition from the labour.\nIn September 2020, goverment again pushed the pump price of petrol to N158 and N162, but met stiff opposition when it tried to effect another price hike in December of the same year .\nWith the attempt to remove subsidy stalled for over five months, government received a major boost when the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) recommended a petrol price of N408.5 per litre per litre.\nThe committee recommends PMS pump price increment from the current N162per litre to N408.5 per litre and (negotiations with organized labour unions).\nWhatever the government resolves with the Labour, we are ready to accept provided the product is available nationwide.",

          "text": "Cheta Nwanze\n\nOn Tuesday, March 26, 2019, a Police Deputy Superintendent, Godwin Oshiogbuwe, was kidnapped from a checkpoint along the Ubiaja-Ewohimi-Agbor road by unknown gunmen. His body was found the next day by a Police tactical team at about 4:40 pm.\n\nIt had been mutilated, and his gun taken away. To my knowledge, none of the men who found the late Oshiogbuwe has ever received any counselling. His killers have, to my knowledge, not been found.\n\nOne thing that has increasingly become a problem in Nigeria is the inability to talk through a problem, because all sorts of people, many of whom are frankly, quite deficient, pollute the discussion with noise. That noise tends to block out nuance.\n\nNuance, in the case of the discussion regarding the Police, means that the nuance that the Police have been very badly behaved, and have thus over time lost the trust of the very population they are meant to be policing, AND at the same time that killing policemen is bad, is absent.\n\nIn February, I wrote a piece about the \u201cEnemies within\u201d in Igboland, where I criticised this new phenomenon of unknown gun men. I got a lot of flak for that from one side of Nigeria\u2019s internecine divide.\n\nEarlier this month I wrote about \u201cBuhari\u2019s new security measures\u201d and got pilloried by the other side. From my viewpoint, both pieces are accurate.\n\nThe President\u2019s hostility towards people of the Igbo ethnic group, my ethnic group, has made the voices of separation a lot stronger among the Igbo. I predicted all this in a 2017 piece about \u201cCreating a hero\u201c. No, I\u2019m no prophet, some things are just too bleeding obvious.\n\nBut I want to talk about the police today.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some numbers.\n\nAs per data compiled by SBM Intelligence from a variety of sources, 497 policemen were killed on duty in various attacks around the country between the start of 2015 and the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe breakdown of these deaths by geopolitical zone shows that 85 of them were killed in the North-Central, 49 in the North-East, 59 in the North-West, 58 in the South-East, 72 in the South-West, while the South-South has been the most dangerous zone for the Police in six years, with 174 of their men killed there.\n\nThis is not to say that the issue isn\u2019t getting worse in the South-East, for instance. In the first quarter of 2021, the South-East trailed only the South-South, which had 20 policemen killed there, and 16 in the South-East.\n\nThe corresponding numbers were two, two, six and two for the North-Central, North-East, North-West and South-West respectively, showing that both the South-East and South-South have a problem that has been amplified in recent times.\n\nIt is impossible to dissociate the amplification (particularly in the South-East) from the call by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) movement on his followers to attack the security services. This call was made at the end of October 2020.\n\nRecently, I saw a video of locals in Owerri, hailing some armed men, and that video broke my heart. That the police has behaved badly towards people in the region, and we will get to that, does not mean that people should take leave of their senses.\n\nSupporting a group of people who will ultimately be unaccountable to you can only end up hurting in the long run as they will ultimately trample on you.\n\nNigeria\u2019s short history is full of examples. For a start, every successful coup in this country\u2019s history was praised by the populace. Then the liberators turned out to be oppressors.\n\nThe problems of the Police are many, and it starts with the structure. Since colonial times, Nigeria\u2019s Police has been structured more as an occupation force than a law-and-order service, which is why policemen are deployed away from their regions of origin, and put in barracks away from the civilian population.\n\nThat will have to change. A policeman can\u2019t be effective if he does not speak the language of those he is meant to police, or understand their cultural contexts.\n\nI once met a policeman named Auwal in Akwa Ibom State, who spoke no Efik or Ibibio, had limited Pidgin English, but was posted to keep the peace in Itu, a community where finding people who could string proper sentences in English was tough. How then would this policeman carry out his job properly in the area?\n\nOur Police have to routinely undergo therapy. Think of the unfortunate men who recovered the late DSP Oshiogbuwe\u2019s body.\n\nThey saw a mutilated corpse, came away with nightmares wondering what kind of anger/hate whoever did that to their colleague harbours for them, and then they will be posted away from Edo State, with the mindset that the people hate them.\n\nImagine if one of those policemen is posted to Orile, Lagos, a place where it has been established on multiple occasions that the locals are hostile to the Police.\n\nImagine the toxic mix that his mindset meeting with the native hostility will brew. Is it a stretch to imagine that he will at some point pick up his gun and shoot someone in that place?\n\nDoes it surprise you thatas at 26 May 2021, the people of Idiroko Road, Ota, Ogun state, blocked the road due to incessant harassment and exhorting of commuters by the police?\n\nThis brings us to the next issue in the matter \u2013 money.\n\nIn the past I have talked about my 2014 encounter with a police inspector during a survey in Lafia, Nasarawa state where he told me that his monthly salary at the time was \u20a652,000 per month.\n\nThe information available to me says that as of the new salary structure approved by President Buhari in November 2018, the said Police Inspector would be earning \u20a687,000 per month.\n\nBelow the rank of Inspector are Sergeant Major, Sergeant, Corporal, Lance Corporal and Constable. Each of these people is given an automatic rifle, and inevitably mounts a checkpoint.\n\nIs it a stretch to imagine that someone earning \u20a643,000 each month (the Constable) would not be tempted to use his gun to supplement his earnings?\n\nFrom the viewpoint of a South-Easterner, the region, Nigeria\u2019s tiniest by landmass, has been feeling under the pressure of excessive policing for years.\n\nIn December 2018, the International Society for Civil Liberties & the Rule of Law published a report that claimed that in the three years prior, the police extorted \u20a6100 billion in roadside bribery and extortion. Shortly before that report, I experienced, and documented, some of that extortion.\n\nIn the absence of any counter research, let us look at these figures. Let us for the sake of argument, assume that each of these incidents of bribery and extortion was done in \u20a61,000 notes.\n\nThis will mean that there were 100,000,000 separate incidents of extortion in three years (1,096 days) or put another way, there were 91,262 incidents of enforced money collection in the South-East each day. Better still, 64 incidents of extortion every minute over the course of three years.\n\nIs that not enough to alienate any population?\n\nCheta Nwanze is a partner at SBM Intelligence.",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has suspended Mali\u2019s membership in response to last week\u2019s coup by Colonel Assimi Goita.\n\nIt also insisted the military junta must stick to the February 2022 deadline for a return to democracy.\n\nThe decisions were taken on Sunday by leaders of the 15-member economic bloc at an emergency summit held in Accra, the Ghanaian capital.\n\nBut the group did not announce new sanctions against the military regime.\n\nThe meeting was called to agree a response to the Malian military\u2019s ouster of a president and prime minister for the second time in nine months.\n\nMali\u2019s neighbours and international powers fear the latest revolt will jeopardise a commitment to hold a presidential election next February, and undermine a regional fight against Islamist militants.\n\nIn a communique after the summit, ECOWAS said Mali\u2019s membership in the bloc was suspended with immediate effect.\n\nHowever it did not announce sanctions like those it imposed after the coup last August, which saw members temporarily close their borders with landlocked Mali and halt financial transactions.\n\nIt also did not call for new interim President Assimi Goita to step down. The army colonel, who led the August coup and last week\u2019s revolt, was declared president on Friday.\n\nInstead, ECOWAS said a new civilian prime minister should be nominated and a new inclusive government formed to proceed with the transition programme.\n\n\u201cThe date of 27th February 2022 already announced for the presidential election should be absolutely maintained,\u201d the leaders\u2019 communique said.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Goita, who attended the summit.\n\nGoita, a 38-year-old special forces commander, was one of several colonels who overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last year.\n\nHe ordered the arrests last Monday of interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Both resigned on Wednesday while still in detention. They were later released.\n\nECOWAS and Western powers including France and the United States worry the political crisis could exacerbate instability in northern and central Mali, a home base for regional affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State.",

As far as the APC is concerned, they will need to redraw the electoral map ahead of 2023 to account for Buhari\u2019s absence in governance and only someone that is an insider can help to rebuild the hopes of Nigerians\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Vice-President has the experience and mature disposition required to govern a multi-ethnic society like Nigeria. Osinbajo is an upright man who stands on the pillar of truth and social justice, who will bring the country out of its present socio-economic problems when he finally becomes the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have realized that youths and women in the country are vital to ensuring Osinbajo and Al-Mustapha ticket, hence, the need to reach out to them.\n\n\u201cThe 2019 Gubernatorial results showed that states like Bauchi and Sokoto which voted for Buhari at the Presidential level did not support APC in the Gubernatorial race. Buhari\u2019s supposed northern appeal has always inferred a guarantee of votes from the heavily populated region, so who do these votes go to in 2023?\u201d.\n\nDr. Gora also disclosed that the Parties of 2019 may not be the powers of 2023.\n\n\u201cFor the APC, the unifying balm of Buhari will still play a vital role to salvage her mistakes and reposition a better Nigeria.

          "text": "A two-day zonal public hearing of the Senate on the review of the 1999 Constitution on Thursday ended with stakeholders from the North-East demanding the creation of additional states, 25 per cent derivation, gender equality, free and compulsory education, among others.\n\nThe exercise was organised by the Senate in 12 centres across the country to collate the views of Nigerians on the key areas to be amended in the 1999 Constitution in order to address agitations in the country.\n\nIn Bauchi centre, the people of Southern Borno comprising nine local government areas on Thursday disagreed with the position of the Borno State government and insisted on the creation of Savannah State.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after presenting their memorandum, a representative of the movement for the creation of Savannah State and former Secretary to Borno State government, Ambassador Dauda Danladi said the southern part of the state is being marginalised, hence the need for the new state.\n\nThe speaker of Borno State House Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan had on Wednesday kicked against the creation of an additional state from Borno, which was demanded by the stakeholders in September last year in a letter to the Senate.\n\nIn the document, the group said the move was necessary as Borno is the largest in the country in terms of landmass to enhance self-determination, compatibility, equitable and even development, and responsive governance.\n\nWith the proposed capital in Damboa, they further said it will comprise nine LGAs in Southern Borno Senatorial District \u2013 Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani.\n\n\u201cWe the people of Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani Local Government Areas of Borno State wish to present our request for the creation of Savannah State out of the present Borno State.\n\n\u201cWe had before now presented requests for the creation of this proposed State at various times in recent years. Between 1982, 1983 and 1996 a request was made by the people of these Local Government Areas of the former Borno State for the Creation of Savannah State to the National Assembly of the Second Republic\n\n\u201cDuring the agitation across the country in 1991 for the creation of more States, requests were made for the creation of two States out of the former Borno State, namely; Savannah and Yobe States. The request for the creation of Yobe State was granted.\n\n\u201cWe had also earlier submitted this request to the National Constitutional Conference through its Committee on the States Creation. The move to kick start the process of reviewing the 1999 constitution then, which could accommodate states and local governments creation along with necessary boundary adjustments was indeed a welcome development and we enthusiastically participated.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, we equally submitted our request to the National Conference Committee on states creation. That effort resulted in the shortlisting of SAVANNAH State as one of the fourteen (14) states recommended for creation in Nigeria. The 2014 Conference report has again clearly shown that SAVANNAH state met all necessary criteria for the creation of the state in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo us, this present move by your humble and esteem selves to Kick-start the process of review of the 1999 Constitution which could accommodate States and Local Government Creation and necessary boundary adjustments, is indeed a welcome stride and we pray that our submission will again receive the blessing of the National Assembly. It is in this regard that we wish to respectfully submit our memorandum for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE with its proposed capital at DAMBOA.\n\n\u201cUnder and in fulfilment of the provisions of section 8(1)(a) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all the democratically elected members at the National, State and local government levels representing the area demanding for the creation of Savannah State, have after consideration of the long time yearnings and aspirations of the people of the proposed state, endorsed this noble request for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunities provided by the State creation to bring Government closer to the people and to foster even and rapid development, the people of the proposed Savannah State who are eager to bring about balanced and accelerated development are making this passionate appeal for your kind consideration of our request for the creation of Savannah State,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter further said \u201cin making our demand for curving out Savannah State out of the present Borno State, we have been motivated by our desire to bring Government closer to our people and to accelerate rapid and even development of the sub-region as well as the need to remain united within the context of the New State and the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the creation of Savannah State out of the present BornoState will make it possible for both states to plan and provide the basis for integrated and even development and thus create more investment and employment opportunities for our people.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Savannah State is richly endowed with Solid Minerals, agricultural products, tourism potentials and human resources that can be harnessed to lay a solid foundation for the transformation of the State.\n\n\u201cIt is an incontrovertible fact that greater part of both the human and material resources of the present Borno state come from the southern part. We are confident that the resources available to the proposed savannah state can sustain it, and make it even more viable than many already established state.\u201d\n\nAmong the mineral resources listed are quartz, limestone, iron ore and magnesium.",

He did not elaborate.\n\nMr Netanyahu accused Mr Bennett of \u201cmisleading the public\u201d and of carrying out \u201cthe fraud of the century\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Yamina party leader\u2019s previous public promises not to join forces with Mr Lapid.\n\nMr Bennett, 49, earlier announced that his party would join talks to form a unity government in a televised address.\n\n\u201cMr Netanyahu is no longer trying to form a right-wing government because he knows full well that there isn\u2019t one. He is seeking to take the whole national camp, and the whole country, with him on his personal last stand,\u201d Mr Bennett said.\n\n\u201cI will do everything to form a national unity government with my friend Yair Lapid.\u201d\n\nBefore the announcement, Israeli media reported that under the proposed terms of the deal, Mr Bennett would replace Mr Netanyahu as prime minister and later give way to centrist leader Yair Lapid, 57, in a rotation agreement. The arrangement has not been officially confirmed.\n\nThe proposed coalition would bring together factions from the right, the left and the centre of Israeli politics. While the parties have little in common politically, they are united in their desire to see Mr Netanyahu\u2019s time in office come to an end.\n\nMr Lapid, a former finance minister, was given until 2 June to form a new coalition government after Mr Netanyahu failed to do so. His Yesh Atid party came second to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud at the last election.\n\nMr Bennett\u2019s party holds a crucial six seats in the 120-member parliament that would help give the proposed opposition coalition a clear majority.\n\nAfter an evening of high political drama on Sunday, Israel is much closer to a new coalition that will unseat its long-time prime minister. But Benjamin Netanyahu should not be written off.\n\nHe was quick to respond to the latest announcement with his own appeal to right-wing members of Naftali Bennett\u2019s Yamina party \u2013 and those of Gideon Saar\u2019s New Hope \u2013 to not join the agreement.\n\nHe taunted them by asking \u201cWho will take care of settlements?\u201d and suggested the proposed unity government would offer a weak security cabinet that would be unable to stand up to Israel\u2019s rival, Iran.\n\nIf he chips away just a couple of members of parliament with these attacks, then the prospective government could tumble.\n\nAnd even if this coalition does get sworn in, it will be a fragile one \u2013 bringing together parties from across the political spectrum with stark ideological differences. To stay in power, it will be forced to kick many sensitive issues into the long grass.\n\nOn Saturday night, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party made an offer to Mr Bennett and the leader of another potential coalition party to share the premiership in a three-way split.\n\nHowever, his offer was rejected. But the prime minister repeated the same option on Sunday.\n\nUnder Israel\u2019s electoral system of proportional representation, it is difficult for a single party to gain enough seats to form a government outright. Smaller parties are usually needed to make up the numbers needed for a coalition.\n\nMr Lapid was initially given a 28-day mandate to form a government, but this was interrupted by the recent 11-day conflict in Gaza.\n\nOne of his potential coalition partners, the Arab Islamist Raam party, broke off talks because of the violence. There were also clashes in Israeli cities between mixed Arab and Jewish populations.",
