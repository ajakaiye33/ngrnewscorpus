          "title": "Buhari orders NDLEA to raid drug hideouts in forests",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). has described Nigeria\u2019s drug war as deadlier than the fight against insurgency and banditry and other threats to the stability of the country.\n\nBuhari said this on Saturday while launching the War Against Drug Abuse initiative by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in commemoration of the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed, \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nAs the Special Guest of Honour at the launch, the President urged the NDLEA to exert more effort to clear out criminal elements habiting the vast forests of the South-South and South-West; from where they plan and execute their criminal attacks and also grow marijuana.\n\nBuhari was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially in the South-West and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people.\n\n\u201cOn this United Nations anti-drug day, I call on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa, said over N90bn worth of cash and drugs have been seized since he assumed office 5 m0nths ago.\n\nMarwa revealed that more than 2,180 traffickers have been arrested, including five drug lords governing different cartels across the country\n\nHe added that the agency has intercepted and seized a whopping 2.05 million kilograms of drugs across the country, and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 jailed by courts.\n\nThe NDLEA Boss said \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Aegean stable in five months.\n\nMarwa broke the disturbing statistics that Nigeria currently ranks the highest in users of cannabis globally, adding that confessions of kidnapped victims who later regained freedom have shown that illicit substances are a prime enabler of the spate of insecurity troubling the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross.\n\n\u201cThe enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, it wasn\u2019t surprising when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who was represented by the Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Francis Agwu, urged the President to okay the employment of 10,000 personnel for the NDLEA which he lamented was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan, who was also represented by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Narcotics Drugs, Senator Ezekiah Dimka, emphasized the need for individual and collective participation to fight drug abuse.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, The United Nations General Assembly, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and to hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nGuterres was represented by the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Oliver Stolpe, who charged law enforcement agents to hunt the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has directed the immediate suspension of the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, popularly known as ACTED.\n\nThe French humanitarian non-governmental organisation was suspended following a discovery on Saturday that it was using a hotel in Maiduguri for training some aid workers on shooting.\n\nZulum\u2019s spokesman, Mallam Isa Gusau, who announced the governor\u2019s directive, said the French NGO was found using toy guns and simulators in training exercises at a hotel located off the Circular Road in Maiduguri, the state capital.\n\nGusau explained that residents near the hotel had reported to officials that they were hearing gunshot sounds from the hotel, following which government officials reported the matter to the GRA Divisional Police Headquarters, which oversees the hotel\u2019s location.\n\nThe police reportedly found some toy pistols at the hotel, while two trainers, both Nigerians, were arrested.\n\nPending the outcome of the police investigation, Zulum has directed the sealing of the hotel and ACTED\u2019s suspension from any humanitarian activity in the state.\n\nGusau said Zulum \u201cacknowledges and deeply appreciates the roles of credible NGOs which have been providing critical humanitarian interventions in different parts of Borno.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe assured them of the government\u2019s continued cooperation and support while also upholding obedience to prevailing laws, policies and rules guiding all activities and actions across the state,\u201d the statement read.\n\nHowever, two ACTED workers arrested by the police, Chinedu Charles and Abdullahi Mustapha, during interrogation said they were using the toy guns to rehearse for a drama in which they were to act as Civilian Joint Task Force members.\n\n\u201cI came out of the hotel with a gun held up in the air and within three minutes, the whole place was filled with people. The gun was a toy gun. We were using it for rehearsal. We were to act as Civilian JTF members in the drama,\u201d Charles told the police.\n\nAlso, Mustapha said, \u201cThe guns are toy guns. One of them was even broken. Women and children started running when they saw the guns. Our officers are French and they were there with us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the state Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development, Saina Buba, said the ACTED\u2019s attitude could not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cThis government is not like other past governments. This is a serious government. We can\u2019t tolerate this kind of attitude in our state. The governor said we should keep them here (at the police station) for now. This particular NGO was banned from the state last week,\u201d Buba said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "East problems will worsen if Nigeria breaks up\u2014 Bishop Gbonigi",
          "text": "Bishop Emmanuel Bolanle Gbonigi\n\n\u2022Narrates how some Yoruba leaders frustrated the efforts of HID Awolowo and his to uplift Yoruba\n\n\u2022\u2018For criticizing govt, Buhari men tried to jail me\u2019\n\n\u2022ADDS: Senate is drain pipe, scrap it; says God is waiting to help Nigeria\n\nBy Dayo Johnson\n\nA former Bishop of Akure Diocese of Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Rev Emmanuel Bolanle Gbonigi, had, at least, three encounters with security agents during the military era because of his positions on national issues. In this interview, Gbonigi reflects on the encounters and speaks on national issues including the agitations for secession which have become loud in the South-West and South-East geopolitical zones, and the place of the Yoruba race in the country.\n\nYou apparently had some encounters with security operatives during the military era because of your stance on national issues. Can you reflect on them?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and I are friends. Between 1984 and1985 when he was military Head of State, I wrote regularly about what his government was doing. He accommodated my criticisms, but his deputy, that man from Ilorin (Major -General) Tunde Idiagbon, didn\u2019t like it. He wanted me to be thrown into detention.\n\nHe ordered the military administrator of Ondo State then, the late Mike Akhigbe, to get me locked up in detention. I was invited thrice by the head of the then-National Security Organisation (NSO) to his office. The first time I went there, I had prepared for detention.\n\nI packed along paraphernalia that I would need, but they didn\u2019t know I was aware they wanted to keep me in their custody. So, when I got there, they said their superior was sent for by the military administrator. At different intervals, they would come to tell me that their boss apologised for keeping me waiting.\n\nThe third time they came, I told them not to bother as I had prepared to spend the night there. They were shocked. So, later they asked me to go. There was another time; they invited me to their office. That day, the Head of State was to visit Ondo State, so they were keeping everything secure. As usual, they asked me different questions and they wanted to detain me.\n\nI was shocked when I saw many people outside. Members of the public, including taxi drivers, were demanding my release. They insisted that if I was not released, they would not go home despite the efforts of security officials to disperse them. When they realised that the people would not budge, they released me.\n\nThe last visit to their office was different. They came to my residence with the official vehicle of their boss and said I would go in the car to their office. But they met the Registrar of our church who was a lawyer with me.\n\nI can\u2019t remember his name now, he is from Ilara. He insisted on going with me. They said they only came for me, but he said since he was present when they came, he would not allow them to take me without going with me.\n\nEventually, they agreed that he should be allowed to come with me. When it was late in the evening, they told the Registrar that they prepared a place for only me to sleep, but he said he would spend the night sitting on the chair. At one point, they surrendered and allowed us to go home.\n\nYou and others fought for the enthronement of democracy in Nigeria\u2026\n\nI will say that what is practised is not true democracy. What democracy means is that power and all the things in the country belong to the people. The people are the owners of the power and all the good things God has bestowed on us.\n\nTo use these things well for the welfare of the people, the people have to elect a few people to represent them. This is what we call the legislature. For instance, at the national level, we have the House of Representatives. They are there to represent the people, their constituencies and not to satisfy themselves.\n\nThey have to listen to the people and do what they want. And they need to work hard so that people get what they need. We also have the Senate. The Senate is expected to do the same thing.\n\nThey are to represent the people and use all resources God has bestowed on us in such a way that the needs of the common people are met, especially the poor, the needy and the unemployed.\n\nWhat do you make of the security situation of the country?\n\nPeople are afraid to leave their houses. Children are afraid to go to school, even teachers are afraid to go to school and tertiary institutions to teach.\n\nAnd farmers are afraid to go to their farms for the fear of being killed or kidnapped.\n\nWe have read about instances where doctors were kidnapped and taken away by gunmen who asked their relatives for ransom in millions of naira if they want their loved ones to come back home alive.\n\nIs it appropriate to describe Nigeria as a failed state?\n\nGovernment, as I said, is not what it ought to be. It is not serving the people the way it should serve. It is not protecting lives and property.\n\nThe type of government we have now is not a good government, it is camouflage. It is highly deceitful.\n\nIn a situation when people want to run for election, they go to the bank to borrow money to buy nomination forms, not to talk of what they pay to their parties, and even the money they spend during campaigns.\n\nWhen Buhari asked to be voted for as President in 2015, I thought he would do well. But the things we are experiencing are not what he promised.\n\nDo you think secession is the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problem as some Yoruba and Igbo elements are advocating?\n\nI do not believe that the way out of the crises is for everyone to go his own way. In 1914, the ethnic groups were joined together by our colonial masters. They joined us together by force. And we had what is called amalgamation.\n\nAnd we have been struggling since then to be one country. Well, it is better for us to pray together and ask God for the grace to help us out of our problems so that we can continue together as one country because, if we break-up, it is not going to be as easy as some people think.\n\nThere will be fighting among states and countries over borders. Look at some of the states in the country, the people fight over land boundaries and, sometimes, it becomes serious. So, if we now break into smaller countries, our problems will be more serious.\n\nSmall countries\n\nMy appeal is that we should not break into small countries. It will not help; rather it will worsen our situation. Let me remind you that those who seek election for possessions are still there, they will be the one jostling for power and still not make things better.\n\nBut if we pray to God, cry to him that we have made mistakes and have done what we ought not to do and repent and change from being selfish, greedy, heartless, lack concern for the needy, and change to become servant leaders, things will change for good.\n\nWhat is your view about the different arms of government that we have in Nigeria?\n\nLet me say this, we don\u2019t need the Senate. We copied it from the United States. America\u2019s economy is strong enough to accommodate two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nBut, in Nigeria, we don\u2019t have the financial strength for such. We copied it from them and we our situation has become worse and we don\u2019t have as much money as America, and our senators take home millions of Naira monthly.\n\nAnd they have not come out to clearly state that it is not so. In a country like ours with no good economy, our senators to take home more than N20 million each while our young, able-bodied, educated citizens are without jobs, and the Federal Government is even contemplating how to reduce workers\u2019 salaries which they do not even pay regularly.\n\nWhat has become of your group, Yoruba Unity Forum?\n\nI am no longer a member of the group. I left when I found out the group was no longer fulfilling the reason for which it was founded. It was founded by the late Chief (Mrs.) HID Awolowo.\n\nShe invited some Yoruba leaders to Ikenne, it got to a point she sent a message to me through an archbishop who is now retired. I told him to kindly tell mama that, at my age, I was now retired.\n\nI said I was more than 70 years old and that what I wanted to do were three things: rest, read and write. God gave me 70 years to serve, I wanted to rest, read and write. She kept pestering me. She said that even if I was in a wheelchair, I should join her. She kept appealing to me to join them\n\nShe said this body that had just been established, they hadn\u2019t named it then, they had made me the chairman and told me I had the freedom to choose the deputy chairman and I told her I needed someone I could trust and was agile and could speak the truth.\n\nOur emphasis was to work hard to make sure we protect Yoruba culture, because psychologists said if the culture of a people dies, the people die. We cannot allow Yoruba culture to die.\n\nThe most important aspect of the culture is the language, and we could see that Yoruba language is dying. Mama said she saw how passionate I had been about Yoruba culture; even when I was a teacher; I had taught Yoruba language to the children on how to do their pastoral job in Yoruba. So, the group was named Yoruba Unity Forum.\n\nYoruba Parapo\n\nBut instead of us working together to protect Yoruba culture, I realized that the majority were using the group as a stepping stone for political offices. And it happened before.\n\nThere was a group called Yoruba Parapo. I was made their chairman. We did very well, but after a while, I found out people were using it to get political offices in Abuja. I was still the Bishop in Akure.\n\nI called them and advised that we work together for the good of all and, in doing that, the good would go round instead of chasing personal ambition.\n\nMost of the time, we held meetings and assigned work to people to help us achieve what we needed to achieve for the welfare of Yoruba people and Yoruba as a whole, but people will just go without carrying out the assignments.\n\nDo you think the Yoruba race has a future in Nigeria?\n\nYes, we are part of the nation. If we do what I have said, repent and do the will of God, God will help us. We have been very selfish and greedy.\n\nIn fact, when you look at what we do from time to time, we are heartless, we don\u2019t have pity on our children, the sick, the weak. They just think of themselves alone and that\u2019s all. If we repent, God will help us, and all things are possible for him to do.\n\nAll powers in heaven and on earth belong to God. But we are like this because we keep doing our will and not His will. If individuals surrender their lives to Him, He will help us and we will be surprised and glorify Him.\n\nGod is waiting to help us, let us go to Him, and Nigeria will become a good county. Nigeria is going to be great.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "File photo of displaced women.\n\nBy Peter Duru, Makurdi; Wole Mosadomi, Minna; Ndahi Marama, Maiduguri, and Ibrahim HassanWuyo, Kaduna\n\n10 years of insurgency in the North-East, raging banditry in the North-West and armed herdsmen menace in the North-Central have left on their trail millions of displaced residents, according to Sunday Vanguard findings.\n\nThe displacement comes with the attendant huge financial and material resources borne by government and humanitarian agencies to cater for victims.\n\nFor instance, although about one million residents displaced in Borno State, the hotbed of the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, have returned home following the restoration of peace in their parts of the state, the state government continues to struggle with the upkeep of at least one million other Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) because there is no enabling environment to return to their ancestral homes.\n\nThere are 31 official IDP camps in the state.\n\nIn essence, the number could be more if unofficial camps are added.\n\nReports from Kaduna State say whereas there are no officially designated IDP camps in the state bogged down by banditry, there may be no fewer than one million IDPs scattered across the state.\n\nBenue is contending with 1,000,007 IDPs sent packing from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen while, whereas there were no official figures on IDPs in Niger where bandits are on the rampage, sacking residents at will, sources said there may be nothing less than 500, 000 IDPs harbored by their different host communities in the state.\n\nBorno\n\nBorno, which bears the greatest brunt of insurgency in the country, initially has a total of over two million IDPs, mostly women and unaccompanied children from Northern, Central and Southern Senatorial Districts.\n\nBut with the liberation of some communities and quite a number of IDPs relocating back to their ancestral homes, over a million of IDPs are still living in camps.\n\nThe National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), it was learnt, has been doing a lot, distributing food and non-food items monthly to the IDPs in addition to other humanitarian assistance from sister agencies.\n\nAlthough Governor Professor Babagana Umara Zulum had said government would close all IDP camps in Borno on or before May 29, 2021 to allow inmates go back to their ancestral homes, the move may not be realistic, considering renewed terror attacks on communities in the last one month which caused huge displacement.\n\nZulum, bemoaning the challenge of taking care of the IDPs while flagging off the distribution of food items donated by an NGO (Baba For All) linked to President Muhammadu Buhari at Muna IDP camp, Maiduguri, said the state government was doing its best, adding that the task was huge for government alone to handle, hence all hands must be on deck to address the challenge.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over the mantle of leadership, we inherited a total of two million IDPs\u201d, he said at the occasion.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have 25 formal camps and 35 non- formal camps. On a serious note, government is finding it very difficult to provide food for this quantum number of our IDPs\u201d.\n\nKaduna\n\nReports from Kaduna State say whereas there are no officially designated IDP camps in the state, there may be no fewer than one million IDPs scattered across the state.\n\nThese are people displaced by the Southern Kaduna conflict and attacks by bandits.\n\nOfficials of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) revealed that there are no officially designated camps for IDPs, saying the one previously used as camp had been given to the military to house female soldiers now providing security on the dreaded Kaduna- Abuja highway.\n\nOn how government is taking care of those that were internally displaced in communities across Kaduna, the officials said they had been integrated into their host communities while government relates with them through Local Emergency Management Committees at the local government level.\n\nSunday Vanguard learned that SEMA officials get quarterly updates on the IDPs from the Local Management Committees\u2019 officials.\n\nSince the IDPs are in the local communities either with relations or other caring citizens, their health concerns are taken care of by Primary Health Care facilities.\n\nThe government is, according to officials, discouraging the setting up of IDP camps in the state because of alleged atrocities committed in such camps.\n\nDonations from NGOs and other groups reach the IDPs through local government officials and traditional leaders.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Agric and the National Commission for Refugees have been donating foodstuff to the IDPs who relocated from communities at Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Kajuru and other troubled areas of Kaduna.\n\nNiger\n\nIn Niger State where 15 of the 25 local government areas have been taken over by bandits, there may be no less than 500, 000 IDPs scattered in different parts of the state.\n\nWorst hit are Shiroro, Munya, Rafi, Mariga, Paiko and Mashegu local government areas.\n\nBecause of the incessant invasion to these communities, residents have either been ejected from their ancestral homes by banditry or they voluntarily fled to the various IDP camps in the state.\n\nAs of now, there are five camps in Niger located in Kuta, Gwada both in Shiroro LGA, one in Rafi, headquarters of Rafi LGA, and one each in Maikunkele, Maitumbi in Bosso and Chanchaga LGAs respectively.\n\nThe one at IBB Primary School in Minna, the state capital has been merged with the one at Gwada.\n\nOfficials said the state government had not relented in its responsibility of catering for the inmates though resources may not be enough due to cash crunch.\n\nReligious organizations, including Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), and individuals have been playing supportive roles in providing various items, including foodstuff, water, detergents and beddings, to assist inmates.\n\nNo doubt, the camps are faced with numerous challenges, including accommodation, feeding, deficiency in provision of health facilities and lack of conveniences like toilets.\n\nBecause the camps are not permanently built to take care of emergencies, schools are mostly used and are grossly inadequate.\n\nNo fewer than 30 to 40 people are clustered in each of the classes available including children.\n\nWater is rationed with no essential drugs to cater for the sick and other emergency cases.\n\nIn other words, the inmates are left in the \u201chands of God\u201d for their survival.\n\nBecause of lack of adequate security at the camps, the store where foodstuff and other essential commodities are kept for the inmates in Gwada was burgled few hours after delivery sometime ago.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the Director General of Niger State Emergency Agency (NSEMA), Alhaji Muhammad Inga, said the exact number of those in various IDP camps in the state could not be determined.\n\nAccording to him, people in the camps keep rising every day.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of security challenges and government is making efforts to make peace prevail in the camps for the people until they return to their ancestral homes\u201d, Inga said.\n\n\u201cIf I give you figures today, in the next one hour, the figure might change and that is why we don\u2019t have the exact number of people in the various camps.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky that despondency has not set in and that is why we are managing the situation professionally because in IDP camps, you have to be careful to know the best strategy to adopt to avoid crisis because if despondency sets in, it will be a bigger issue to manage\u201d.\n\nBenue\n\nIn Benue, since 2018, shortly after the New Year\u2019s Day massacre in Logo and Guma LGAs and the subsequent attacks that followed in the days and months after, the state has been challenged by IDPs sacked from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen who the people believe are on a mission to take over Benue land.\n\nWhile the attacks raged, the state government was compelled to open official IDPs camps for the displaced and presently the officially recognized camps in the state are seven.\n\nAside the official camps, IDPs also reside in host communities since the facilities in the camps lacked carrying capacity for all the displaced persons at a time.\n\nThen there are the unofficial camps where people have also sought refuge.\n\nAccording to records obtained from the Benue State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in the official and unofficial facilities or camps we have records of inmates who moved into the safe haven in 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the 2019 record of IDPs showed that Abagena camp has 8,210 IDPs while the Abagena host community is home to 7,691 inmates. Daudu Camp 1 (UNHCR Shelter) has 5,451 IDPs, Daudu ll has 20,172 while Gbajimba camp is home to 29,500 inmates.\n\nOthers are Anyiin camp with 7,466 inmates, Ugba camp with 3,080, Abeda camp with 2,668 while Abeda host community has 22,948 IDPs.\n\nAgan camp has 4,798 inmates while the host community is home to 5,517 IDPs.\n\nAgatu is home to 65,347 IDPs, Angwan Ochonu has 4,951 IDPs, Anyiin community has 65,496 IDPs, Daudu community is home to 43,344 inmates, FHA camp has 4,353 IDPs, and Gbajimba community is home to 28,875 IDPs.\n\nGwer West has 60,243 IDPs, Ichwa 9,587, Kwande 9,465, LDEA NASME 23,151, LGEA Tyodugh has 5,672 IDPs, NEPA Qtrs 8,008, Ogiri Ajene 9,506, Okpokwu 4,080, Tionsha 20,500 and Ugba community is home to 8,651.\n\nThe total number of IDPs living in official and unofficial camps and host communities since 2019 is 483,692.\n\nThe number of those displaced as a result of herdsmen attacks as updated in June 2020 is 75,811 and a breakdown of the figure indicated that Mbakunu (Kwande) is home to 2,951 IDPs, Mbaper (Kwande) is hosting 1,602 IDPs, Iyon (Kwande) has 489 inmates and Jato Aka/Nyihemba (Kwande) has 37,675 IDPs.\n\nOthers are Ogere (Obi) 17, 858, Torkula (Guma) 817, Agasha (Guma) 1,502, Kaseyo (Guma) 652, Ikponko (Guma) 712 and Uikpam (Guma) is home to 11,554 IDPs.\n\nThese figures, updated in December 2020 as a result of sustained attacks by armed herders in more communities, indicated that more communities in Guma like Uleva community is host to 13,855 IDPs, Iye community is hosting 16,578 displaced persons and Tse Akenyi community has 22,873 IDPs.\n\nLogo has Iorja community hosting 14,000 IDPs, Tse Akpam community 11,369 and Igbatim community with 16,541 inmates.\n\nIn Makurdi, there are 18,000 IDPs in Imande Akpu community while Tse Chagu community is playing host to 6,000 IDPs.\n\nThe total number of persons displaced in 2020 as a result of sustained attacks on Benue communities by suspected herdsmen militia is 205, 027.\n\nMeanwhile, the statistics of displacement as a result of further attacks on several communities in Benue in 2021 showed that Guma LGA, Uikpam IDP camp is home to 27,222 persons, Yogbo community hosts 19,911 persons, Udei community hosts 20,932, Ortese community harbors 17, 654, Umenger has 19,277 while Yelwata community is host to 17,00 IDPs.\n\nIn Gwer West, Naka community harbors 23,070 IDPs, Aondoana community has 15,171 while Tyoughtee community has 19,888 IDPs.\n\nIn Makurdi, there are 16,865 IDPs in Atson community and 11,987 in Anter community. Logo is harboring 13,065 in Tse Agure while 1,765 IDPs are in Tse Akau Akpor community.\n\nKonshisha, where a military operation recently took place to recover the weapons of the soldiers slain by bandits, has 5,958 IDPs in Gungul community. Agidi community is home to 1,143 IDPs, Aku community has 3,852, Adoka community has 702, Bonta 2,250, Gbinde community 1,548, Tse Anyon 1,512 and Guleya Community is home to 2,142 IDPs.\n\nIn Oju LGA, Ukpute community is host to 1,954 IDPs while Agatu LGA has 10,981 IDPs in Okokolo community, 21,098 in Obagaji, 10,400 in Aila, 12,091 in Odugbeho and 11,850 are harbored in Oweto communities.\n\nREAD ALSO: Zulum storms camp at midnight for headcount over fake IDPs\n\nThe total figure of people displaced in Benue communities in 2021 alone is put at 311,288, bringing the overall number of IDPs in Benue to a grand total of 1,000,007.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these IDPs are from different communities of the state including Kwande, Okpokwu Guma, Makurdi, Gwer West, Logo, Oju, Konshisha and Agatu LGAs who were attacked and sacked from their ancestral homes by suspected armed herdsmen.\n\nHowever, those of Konshisha were sacked from their homes after a military operation to recover the weapons of the soldiers slain by bandits in the area.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary of Benue SEMA, Dr. Emmanuel Shior, since the displacement of these persons, the state government took it upon itself to ensure that the needs and security of the IDPs were catered for.\n\nHe explained that the efforts of government is being complemented by NGOs, public spirited individuals and groups who have been providing food, shelter, medical, water sanitation and hygiene activities in the camps.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the Federal Government has not shown enough commitment to the welfare of the IDPs leaving the state government to grapple with the overwhelming challenge of catering for the IDPs,\u201d he said\n\nThe Executive Secretary also pointed out that quantifying the worth of government\u2019s intervention in the camps in terms of Naira and Kobo may be difficult but it runs into millions of Naira monthly.\n\nOn the challenges in the camps he said, \u201cthe challenges we have in these camps are that of food, security and health issues.\n\n\u201cBut I must acknowledge that we have some international and local organisations supporting the government have been doing so in the areas of water supply, health, including WASH.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of outbreak of diseases in the camps, he clarified that the camps had not recorded any of such because inmates were receiving adequate medicare from partners and the state government.\n\n\u201cBut our worry at the moment is that of security in the camps. In all the camps, IDPs are entertaining fears of being attacked due to the recent attack that happened at the Abagena IDPs camp. So there are fears of possible attacks in the camps at the moment\u201d, the SEMA boss said.\n\n\u201cIn fact some of the IDPs, out of fear, look for where to sleep in the host communities for fear of being victims of another herders\u2019 attack\u201d, he said.\n\nSuspected armed herdsmen had, at the wee hours of April 27, 2021, invaded the Abagena IDPs camp in the outskirts of Makurdi town, killing seven inmates.\n\nThe attack, which took place at about 2am, also left many of the nearly 20,000 traumatized IDPs with serious injuries.\n\nThat invasion almost sparked a reprisal by angry Benue youths who recovered the remains of the slain IDPs and laid them on the busy Makurdi-Lafia highway threatening to avenge their death.\n\nThey also demanded to be allowed to carry AK47 rifles to defend themselves just like armed herders.\n\nIt took the personal intervention of Governor Samuel Ortom to prevail on the angry youths to sheath their swords.\n\nAfter convincing the youths, the governor appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to take decisive action against armed herders who had been accused of unleashing mayhem on innocent Nigerians, warning that the people were not convinced that he was doing enough in that regard.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "NEW CONSTITUTION: Reps disagree",
          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu, ABUJA\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives are divided on whether what Nigeria needs is amendments to the 1999 Constitution currently being carried out by the National Assembly or a new Constitution as demanded by a segment of the society, to address fundamental issues in the country.\n\nThey were, however, united in their observation that Section 9 of the 1999 Constitution did not provide for a referendum that will lead to the making of a new Constitution.\n\nSpecifically, some Southern and Middle Belt leaders, under the aegis of Southern and Middle Belt Forum, had, consistently, called for a halt to the ongoing Constitution review to pave the way for a brand new Constitution,\n\nBelow are the submissions of the lawmakers who spoke to Sunday Vanguard.\n\nWe will repeal Section 9 of 1999 Constitution\u2014 Hon. Kingsley Chinda(Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency of Rivers State)\n\n\u201cI sincerely believe that we need a new Constitution and not to continue to patch (by altering) the inappropriate and skewed 1999 Constitution.\n\nFor this reason I am least excited over the Constitution amendment that is ongoing as I don\u2019t believe in the exercise.\n\n\u201cThe zonal tours that we are presently on (Senate and Reps) is a mere formality, I won\u2019t call it jamboree. I doubt if the benefit that will come from the tours will be worth the cost of the exercise.\n\n\u201cI have already proposed a new Constitution by repealing Section 9 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis work commenced in the 8th Assembly by some colleague and I but we didn\u2019t conclude it and many of those colleagues didn\u2019t come back to the Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe snag I have with pushing same forward is that S.9 of the Constitution appears not to be wide enough to accommodate a repeal of the entire Constitution and reenactment of a new one.\n\n\u201cI have, therefore, proposed an alteration to Section 9. Though the Bill as it appears to be conventional with my Bills is yet to be listed. I shall forward a 2nd copy.\n\n\u201cThe 9th NASS would have concentrated on the low hanging fruits that are completely under our purview.\n\n\u201cLet us conclude the amendment to the Electoral Act and pass the PIB. These are two Bills that will positively impact on the country.\n\n\u201cThese Bills that started on a high note are almost cold for no just cause.\n\n\u201cAgain, I opine that the failed Federal Government is encouraging the Constitution review as a distraction to Nigerians who are groaning under the weight of a failed economy with dollar exchanging for N600 and insecurity at a proportion never experienced in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution review is to distract Nigerians and keep them away from discussing security, economy and the failed Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThe issues of economy and security will take a back seat for the next two months. They would then look for another distraction before we go past the Constitution review.\n\n\u201cI agree that we need a new Constitution that should be Nigerian, pragmatic, equitable, fair and visionary.\n\n\u201cIn the new Constitution that we proposed, some of the highlights are: Unicameral legislature; Fiscal Federalism; Political Federalism; Unbundled Security Architecture up to Community Level and subject to ability to fund same, with clear functions and jurisdiction for each tier; Unbundled Exclusive List to allow state management of resources; Total fiscal autonomy of arms of government and tiers of government; Easier recall system for non-performing public officers and Indigeneship\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s amend Constitution to accommodate referendum first\u2014 Hon Solomon Maren(Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency of Plateau State)\n\n\u201cMay I say they are right to clamour for that because of the inability of past Assemblies to effect meaningful changes to the Constitution despite the huge cost associated with the process and the societal ills resulting from the failure of such alterations.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the present Constitution that gives us power to switch from this Constitution to another. However, we can achieve the 1963 Constitution by amending the present Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe major issue with the present Constitution is the overloaded Exclusive List. Once we unbundle the Exclusive List, our problem would have been solved.\n\n\u201cWe will as well need to include the right to referendum on any matter to give Nigerians the right to take decision on any matter of interest.\n\n\u201cVoting on the issues either in the National Assembly or state Houses of Assembly should be monitored by all Nigerians to know who voted in support of what?\n\n\u201cNigerians are being killed daily, corruption is on steady rise and poverty is on the increase; so, definitely any Nigerian who is truly patriotic will want any form of change if it guarantees peace and prosperity for the nation.\u201d\n\nWe need to have referendum/plebiscite in place\u2014Hon. Serguis Ogun(Esan North-East Federal Constituency of Edo State)\n\n\u201cSection 9 of the 1999 Constitution as amended allows for alteration of the Constitution, doesn\u2019t empower NASS to rewrite the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWhat can be achieved by this alteration is plebiscite or referendum; by so doing, the people (Nigerians) can, in the future, vote for a new Constitution and the modalities for its emergence.\n\n\u201cThe pathway to achieving this is the piecemeal alteration which is ongoing.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians vote to adopt the 1963 Constitution, it gives it credibility and will be widely accepted by all. They should lobby for the ongoing alteration to contain plebiscite/referendum.\u201d\n\nWe can go back to 1963 Constitution to help zones develop independently \u2013 Hon. Bede Eke, representing Abor Mbaise/Ngor Okpala Federal Constituency of Imo State\n\n\u201cI concur with the fact that we should go back to the 1963 Constitution which gave then geo-political zones the leverage to develop independently.\n\n\u201cThat was the reason we have Cocoa House in the South-West and the coal era in the South-East.\n\n\u201cSir Michael Okpara as then-governor of the South-East was able to distribute dividends of democracy round his region, built the Metropolitan Hotel, Calabar and Presidential Hotels in Enugu and Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cAll the regions\u2019 economies were concentrated on where they have comparative advantage.\n\n\u201cBut because, we do not have a government at the federal level that is ready to listen to the representatives of the people, it becomes difficult to achieve.\n\n\u201cMy take is that instead of losing everything, we can go piece meal and ensure that we, at least, have true federalism where state police can be guaranteed because of our security challenges, fiscal federalism and having a large and significant part of the Executive List move to the Concurrent List.\n\n\u201cIf possible, going back to the 1963 Constitution will usher in a new Nigeria\u201d.\n\nMy problem is the operators of the Constitution \u2014Hon, Mohammed Garba Datti(Sabongari Federal Constituency of Kaduna State)\n\n\u201cThis issue of Constitution review, the elites are looking for a way. How can you go back to the 1963 Constitution?\n\n\u201cIf you are from Abia, can you revert to the former Eastern Region so that there will be no Abia again? Everybody is just confused. When you say restructuring, everybody has a way of looking at it.\n\n\u201cPeople of the South-South are calling for fiscal federalism so that everybody will control his own resources.\n\n\u201cThe people of the South-East, the Igbo, some will say, need more states to be at par with other zones.\n\n\u201cZone is a creation of Alex Ekwueme in 1996. Nigeria only has states but when he went to Constitutional Conference, he came with the idea of six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cIt has not been adopted anywhere. Did anybody from the military participate in the making of the 1999 Constitution?\n\n\u201cWas it not Justice Nikky Toby of the Supreme Court that oversaw the making of the 1999 Constitution? There was no single military man in the Conference.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution is almost the same with the 1979 constitution. There were only few changes and who were those that drafted the 1979 Constitution? The drafting Committee, was it not led by Chief Rotimi Williams, the 49 wise men in an exercise in which the late chief Awolowo withdrew? Is it not the same Constitution?\n\n\u201cLook, my problem is the operators of the Constitution and not the constitution itself. No Constitution in the world is perfect. It is only our attitude.\n\n\u201cEverybody tends to pay allegiance to his own ethnic group, church or mosque or religion.\n\n\u2018Very few people are nationalists who believe that Nigeria should be one and we should all work for the progress of the country. We are not the only country that is diverse in the world. Many countries have their own diversity but they are able to manage it, accommodate each other.\n\n\u201cAnd the mentality of turn-by-turn is another problem because everybody wants to promote his own ethnic group and his people. Unless we change, nothing will change.\n\n\u201cWho are those clamoring for referendum? Look, these arguments are elitist. The masses don\u2019t know anything.\n\n\u201cEverybody is just talking, looking for a means of survival.\n\n\u201cWhat type of perfect Constitution are you envisaging now?\n\n\u201cEven within the Yoruba nation, yes, people are calling for Oduduwa Republic but the people of Lagos believe Lagos is a special place, that they are not going to belong to any Oduduwa Republic because 60 percent of Nigeria\u2019s economy is domiciled in Lagos.\n\n\u201cAll of us are all guilty unless we stop thinking the way we are thinking. Like I said earlier, my problem is the operators of the Constitution and not the Constitution itself.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt/Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\nMandate South-South governors to set up common security outfit to fight banditry\n\nMilitant group Avengers returns, threatens attacks on oil facilities, politicians\n\nThe South South geo-political zone has raised the ante in the agitation for the restructuring of the country, handing down a three-month ultimatum to the federal authorities to start the process of giving Nigeria a new lease of life.\n\nNiger Delta leaders emerged from a meeting in Port Harcourt late Friday asking the federal government to convene a national dialogue for the purpose of charting a new course for the country.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) announced its return to the creeks ahead of launching what it called Operation Humble to destroy targeted oil installations in the region.\n\nThe Niger Delta leaders, in a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of a South-South zonal conference in Port Harcourt, said the dialogue they are advocating should draw its membership from all ethnic groups to chart a new course for the country.\n\nThe conference had as its theme, \u201cRestructuring: imperatives for sustainable development, unity and security.\u201d\n\nThey spoke of an urgent need for the devolution of powers to the states and vowed to resist oppressive and repressive tendencies against the Niger Delta region and its people.\n\nThey appealed to the Federal Government to stop selling their resources to the Chinese and others.\n\nThe stakeholders, who came from the nine states of the region, threatened to actualise their freedom if nothing happened at the expiration of the ultimatum.\n\nThe communique was read by prominent Niger Delta activist and President of Agape Birthrights Development Initiative, Ms. Ann Kio-Brigss.\n\nThe communique: \u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta hereby give the Government of Nigeria a three months window within which to cordially address our concerns towards re-federalising the polity, by convening a national dialogue of the representatives of the ethnic groups in Nigeria to chart a new course for the country.\n\n\u201cAt the expiration of this three months window, we the people of the Niger Delta will commence the process that will guarantee our freedom and progress.\n\n\u201cOur people should mobilise all human resources to see that fiscal federalism and devolution of powers are included in the constitution. There should be internal justice amongst us- charity begins at home.\n\n\u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta hereby reaffirm their commonality, unity and oneness despite our multi-ethnic diversities.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people, who are the breadwinners of Nigeria, demand to be heard and fairly treated with equity by the oppressive Nigerian state, and by extension, the insensitive Nigerian political class, as the only basis for peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta demand restructuring, with the states as the federating units and devolution of more powers to the states.\n\n\u201cWe the ethnic nationalities of the South-South affirm the right of peoples to self-determination and to fully control their resource to stop and put an end to further deprivation and despoliation of their environment which they have suffered in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Niger Delta will take all lawful measures to develop an agenda for freedom and liberation and development of the region.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta ethnic nationalities hereby demand that the governors of the South-South immediately set up security outfits in their respective states and network with each other in the region to protect our territories against terrorists, criminals, land grabbers and other criminals who often operate as bandits and kidnappers.\n\n\u201cNiger Deltans demand that the governors of the South-South region immediately set up community based defence forces in all local government areas of the South-South.\n\n\u201cThe ethnic nationalities of the Niger Delta demand the Federal Government of Nigeria to immediately discontinue the selective appointments, posting and deployment of mainly non- Middle-Belt and Southern Nigerian security officials to the Niger Delta to oppress our people.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta demands equal representation, control and headship of all relevant security and military organisations in the country. The Niger Delta demands and expresses the desire for a provision in the Nigerian constitution for the exercise of the inalienable right to self- determination through a referendum in line with international laws.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta demands total ownership rights to lands, natural resources, seas and waters by communities wherever such are located in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta has resolved to put an end to all oppressive and repressive tendencies by the Nigerian State against our region and warns that we shall no longer tolerate same from other nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people demand immediate environmental remediation and clean-up of Niger-Delta which has been deliberately devastated by crude oil exploration and exploitation.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta governors should as a matter of extreme urgency take the issue of food security as to prevent the starvation of our people in the event of any food blockade.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta governors are to ensure protection of the flora/fauna and take interest in general environmental protection, including endowments above or beneath the soil for sustainable development.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people demand that the federal government desists from selling out our resources to the Chinese or Sukuk promoting countries, to secure any project.\n\nThe Niger Delta People demand their enjoyment of the right to own and bear arms for self defence as law-abiding citizens. The selective grant of firearms licences is hereby condemned and denounced. This is necessary considering the present state of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people of Niger Delta demand the establishment of State Police in their respective states.\u201d\n\nThe Port Harcourt meeting came 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and promised to follow the lead of the National Assembly to implement the wishes of Nigerians on restructuring.\n\nBuhari said he would not hesitate to endorse any move by the National Assembly on restructuring.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part,\u201d he told the Professor Benjamin Okaba-led delegation of the INC.\n\nOnly penultimate Saturday, the President had branded agitators of restructuring and secession as mischievously dangerous and na\u00efve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are telling us to dissolve a system and call for an obscure conference to come and discuss how we can move forward as a nation, that can never be done and no country will agree to that,\u201d Buhari had said in a message to the launch of the Kudirat Abiola Sabon Gari Peace Foundation in Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose who are discussing restructuring, my question is that what are you going to restructure?\n\n\u201cIf you ask many Nigerians what are they going to restructure, you will find out that they have nothing to talk about.\n\n\u201cSome of them have not even studied the 1999 Constitution. The 1999 Constitution is almost 70 to 80 per cent 1979 Constitution.\u201d\n\nNiger Delta Avengers returns with Operation Humble to cripple economy\n\nIn a separate statement, the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) said it was staging a return to the creeks to launch Operation Humble designed to destroy targeted oil installations in the region.\n\nThe statement was posted on NDA\u2019s website.\n\nIt threatened to hit political actors collaborating with the Federal Government to \u201cundermine the interest of the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nStakeholders had warned the Federal Government and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, of the consequences of reneging on their pledge to constitute a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) by the end of June.\n\nThe month ends on Wednesday.\n\nThe NDA said that it suspended its Operation Red Economy\u201a which bled the Nigerian economy into recession about four years ago not because it was lazy but for the love it had for the people and out of respect for the voice of the elders of the Niger Delta region.\n\nAlthough NDA made no mention of the NDDC board issue in its latest statement, it hinged its decision on the underdevelopment of the region and the undermining of the collective interests of the people of the region.\n\nThe NDA, after a meeting of its high command, said it had lost confidence in all socio-cultural groups like the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), the elders and \u201cthe bunch of so-called ex-agitators frolicking with the government at our detriment\u201d.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis operation shall be coded Operation Humble aimed at bringing down targeted oil installations in the Niger Delta capable of humbling the economy into permanent recession. This mission is also targeted at political actors who are collaborating with the Nigerian government to undermine the interest of the Niger Delta people.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Nigerian government has continued to pay deaf ears to our demands and the rising challenges in the country because the pipelines that crisscrosses our lands are left untouched, allowing dollars to flow into the federal treasury on a daily basis for mismanagement.\n\n\u201cWe shall spare no single oil installation within our range of strategic targets marked for destruction in the coming days and we bet the Nigerian Government will be humbled to return to the drawing board and chart an all inclusive course by the time we are done with our action plan.\n\n\u201cMembers of our strike teams across the Niger Delta are commanded to be on red alert awaiting precise strike plans as mapped by the high command of the NDA.\n\n\u201cThe high command of the NDA has promoted and appointed one of our finest operatives, Field Commander Tu-ere aka Queen of the Creeks to the rank of Brigadier General. She is an experienced field agent who before now was the head of the counter intelligence unit of the NDA, using her connections with top government and security officials to deliver on her assignment\u201d.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cShe was part of our elite Strike Teams that attacked and took down the Chevron Valve platform on the 4th of May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line on the 3rd of June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline on the 11th of July, 2016.\n\n\u201cBrig. Gen. Tu-ere is the first female to ever attain this level and it is solely out of merit, and is placed in charge by the High Command of the NDA to execute operation humble to the letter.\n\n\u201cAs a gender friendly organisation, we are using this avenue to encourage other female operatives within the rank and file of the NDA to be inspired by the rising profile of the Queen of the Creeks and never to deter in delivering on our mission of liberate our people and God given resources from the shackles of the oppressive Nigerian Government. We advise other female operatives to emulate her and be dedicated to our mission at all times.\n\n\u201cConclusively, we wish to state unequivocally and in simple terms that we are back with operation Humble; with the aim of humbling the economy into permanent recession and political players from the Niger Delta extraction to political retirement.\n\n\u201cOur Strike Teams 01 \u2013 09 and all other formations are to regroup and remain on red alert awaiting further command.\u201d\n\nNavy: we\u2019re not aware of any threat to attack oil facilities\n\nContacted on Saturday over the Niger Delta Avengers\u2019 threat, the Nigerian Navy said it was not aware of any such statement.\n\nBut it said it was battle ready for groups threatening to carry out attacks on critical oil installations in the Niger Delta region or any other part of the country.\n\nThe Director of Information Nigerian Navy, Commodore Suleiman Dahun, told The Nation that the Navy was well positioned to protect all oil installations in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any such threat, but you can be rest assured that the Navy is positioned to deal with any threat to peace and order,\u201d Dahun said on the phone.\n\nNiger Delta Affairs Minister Godswill Akpabio said on Tuesday that Nigeria could not afford to have crisis in the South South now on account of its economic importance to the nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAkpabio told reporters after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, that he was doing his best to ensure peace, especially in the Niger Delta, because of its strategic economic importance.\n\nHe also said he had fast-tracked action on the constitution of the NDDC board and that the names of nominees would soon be forwarded to the National Assembly.\n\nAkpabio, however, said the ongoing field forensic audit to the commission must be completed as the outcome would serve as a guide to the board\u2019s operations.\n\nAccording to him, the audit report should be turned in by the end of next month.",

          "title": "\u2018How the church should deal with terror, hostilities\u2019",
          "text": "Rev Dr Matthew Awujoola is President Lagos East Baptist Conference. He spoke with Sunday Oguntola on issues relating to the church and nation. Excerpts:\n\nAre Baptists evangelical, protestant, conservative or a blend of everything?\n\nFrankly speaking, we have not moved from what we have been. We are evangelicals. And as evangelicals, we believe strongly in the entirety of the Bible, not just a single experience in the Bible. We believe from Genesis to Revelation and we operate Genesis to Revelation, and to better stress that, as Evangelicals we believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, the operations of the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn terms of the worldview, are Baptists progressives or conservatives?\n\nSincerely, Baptists are progressives within the context of the standards of Scripture. That is who we are.\n\nThe congregational system of the church inadvertently creates tension between the pulpit and the pew. How can this be diffused?\n\nWell, first and foremost for me, anywhere you have more than one person, there will definitely be conflict. We should not misunderstand the natural tendencies and turn that to be anything extra ordinary. Let\u2019s come down to what actually are the areas of tension so for anybody who is raising that kind of objection, there must be specific areas to know how to actually address it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWell a lot of pastors in the church want to fully call the shot like their Pentecostal counterparts while members want to have a say in decision making. How do you resolve that because it\u2019s really a big problem?\n\nThank you so much for that. Frankly speaking, for me, I don\u2019t think that is a problem. I think the problem for issues like this is a problem of education or thorough understanding of the makeup, the structure, operations of the people called the Baptists, how the local church should operate. For any pastor who truly understands what it is, there won\u2019t be any crisis.\n\nBecause the Scripture is very clear on the position of the pastor in the church. What is the position of the members? Very clear. What is the position of the deacons? Very clear. When any of these players don\u2019t really understand their positions and their limits, then there will be trouble.\n\nA pastor may not understand comprehensively his position and limits, then he may drive his position beyond the limits. There shall be crises.\n\nSo each of those parties have limits?\n\nThey have positions and limits. They do. It is very clear. It\u2019s not only in the Baptist, it\u2019s everywhere. In every organisation, you have your position, you have your limits. By the time you are stepping beyond your position, you are going to infringe on other people\u2019s rights and privileges. And for that, there will be crises. I think that is the problem.\n\nSo the best thing is to have a reorientation or reeducation of our people on what Baptist polity is actually. Many people are not getting it or some people are not getting it correctly whether the pastor, deacon or any other church members, if they are not getting it correctly, there will definitely be crises.\n\nWhich is more powerful in the Baptist Church: the local church or the cooperating bodies?\n\nThe local church is powerful because the local church, by our style, is responsible for the cooperative bodies like the Association, the Conference and the Convention. But the other way round in practice is that the local church submits a substantial part or a good part of their liberty or their power to the operation of the Association, the Conference and the Convention.\n\nAnd by that, they are also responsible to obey and to comply with whatever these bodies have decided on since they are part of the body that decided that we are going to be operating or doing this or doing that. So they should be responsible to submit to such an arrangement.\n\nYour oncoming conference is on the church and political engagement in the times of hostility but there are so many Christians who believe that the church should have nothing to do with politics. What\u2019s your take on this and the position of the Baptist Church on politics and the Church?\n\nThere\u2019s nowhere in the Bible that we are forbidden or in our policy as a Baptist that we are forbidden from interfering or being involved in politics. There\u2019s no way. In fact, we are commanded by the Scripture to be salt and light in our society. And one of the ways we can do that is also to participate in the development of our community.\n\nBut where there is a difference is that as a Baptist, we are not expecting that the State should dictate the nitty gritty of how we worship inside the local church. And as also the church, we are also not expected to come as a church as an entity to dictate to the State what should be done. If anybody feels he should be a politician, no problem. He should go on personal ground and become involved.\n\nCan the church show support?\n\nDefinitely!\n\nTo what extent will the church support?\n\nThe church will support through legitimate means.\n\nHow?\n\nThrough votes, if the member is found worthy.\n\nWill the church give endorsement to a trusted member? Does the pastor or the church say this is someone we want for this position?\n\nHonestly, yes. That\u2019s allowed.\n\nOh! That\u2019s allowed. But we haven\u2019t seen much of that. Maybe so many pastors are not aware?\n\nNo. They might not be aware or we have not been encouraging more of our members to be involved in politics. You know, this is just coming up more and more recently, there is this fresh awareness on the involvement of members in politics. So as we speak, many of our members are just coming up. So it\u2019s possible that we have not been seeing such but we have such already happening, that Christians as light and as salt must be involved in the operation of the State.\n\nHow can the church respond or what should be the response of the church to hostility in the political environment?\n\nNumber one, the Church or Christians should be involved in the operation of our society, at every level, and that involvement will begin from how we as an entity, the church as an entity, is able to influence the immediate environment, who are we to our neighbors, to our immediate neighbors, how have we been able to meet their needs, in terms of welfare, in terms of care, what kind of message do we represent to them, peace-loving, caring.\n\nReally?\n\nYes! Be a card carrying member of any political party. Be actively involved. There are people amongst us who are specifically called for this. Let\u2019s encourage them, we motivate them. Let them be involved at the ward level, at the state level, and at every other level of our operation. They should be part.\n\nBy the time they are part, they will be able to help. And all these involvements will also help us to operate our policies and to implement government policies. In Nigeria, we have a kind of culture that is very funny. We have great policies but we don\u2019t implement them. Can anybody who is Christ-minded, people-loving, follow through with these policies at all the strata of our government?\n\nSo we need people who are that courageous and people-loving enough to follow through with the policies. Another way of involvement is giving support to those who are in leadership, not only in the area of prayers but also providing a form of counsel and support for them, meeting them one- on- one, those who are in government are not dropped from the moon, they are human beings, they have friends, family members.\n\nIf a church is under an attack in a hostile community, what should it do or how should it respond?\n\nSincerely, I subscribe to self-defense. You can\u2019t wait and let people kill you. Ethically, it\u2019s accepted. Scripturally, it\u2019s acceptable to protect yourself from being killed. That is within one\u2019s rights.\n\nBut when Jesus was about to be arrested and Peter fought back, He resisted him. Is that also a possible response?\n\nThat was a rare case; just one case. There were times when Jesus ran away from being lynched. There\u2019s another time he confronted them, not violently now but he confronted them, and he disarmed them with just words of interaction. So he defended himself. When he submitted himself to be killed, that was on purpose for the salvation of the world.\n\nSo it is wrong for a Christian to say these terrorists are in my community and I will hand myself over. That would be suicide, isn\u2019t it?\n\nYes, definitely. You have to protect yourself. You have to defend yourself.\n\nWith what?\n\nAny legitimate means. Anything that is legitimate. With whatever that is legitimate, you have to protect yourself but that aside terrorists also are human beings. They have agitations. There are miscreants sometimes, so to speak, in the community where we live and in order to douse the tension around us we have to engage some of them: Why are you so violent? Why are you doing this? And on some occasions, we see them dropping their arms. Terrorists are human beings too.",

          "title": "OBEY ETOK CHIMA: I am shocked men are still chasing me",
          "text": "When in 1998 Obey Etok-Chima came with her coursemates to Lagos for an excursion from the Department of Theatre Arts, Imo State University (IMSU) and landed a role in the blockbuster movie; \u2018Camouflage\u2019 little did she know that she is going to be a hit in tinsel town.\n\nAfter the event, Obey, a name she later became popular with, stayed back a while for more jobs before she went back, graduated and became a household name in Nollywood.\n\nHer role as Sandra in one of the Wale Adenuga television series, No Pain, No Gain of the Super Story fame shot her to limelight and some of her works include Aristos, From A Distance, Edima, Disguised, Power of Love, Two in Love, My Promised Land, Nsuto-Anwan among others.\n\nWith contemporaries like Rita Dominic, Jennifer Eliogu, Genevieve Nnaji among others, Obey who hails from Ikot-Ekpene Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and happily married took a long break to attend to family matters, now she is fully back and ready to blast as she told Sam Anokam in this chat.\n\nWhat actually happened; did you totally leave acting?\n\nFor the records I did not totally leave acting. Family set in and I had to raise my kids as I didn\u2019t have any house help. The country is bad. It is not as it used to be before that you can leave your children with your neighbours. News abound of house helps with evil intentions. And I don\u2019t want to be a victim. I am scared about things like that. I have heard about a lot of negative things about how it happened to my friend. Even my colleague in the industry was a victim. A house help poisoned one of the children who died. I had to take care of them.\n\nEven in the midst of all taking care of my home, I was still doing some jobs.\n\nWhen you are married to a typical Igboman, it is not everybody that understands what you do. Most Igbomen want their wives to do business. But they don\u2019t understand that that is not your calling. My husband was like he was going to support my passion at first. You know when a man is looking for something he will tell you whatever, when you now enter, what you think would happen may not begin to happen. Igbomen usually want a hundred per cent attention on their children. They do not joke with them at all.\n\nThen, I had a boutique but it didn\u2019t progress as I expected. Then I began to sell things. My husband is based abroad and he usually ships things. Whenever he does, I distribute to supermarkets, still, I wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nAre you now fully back to the industry?\n\nYes. My husband has seen that all the things he set up for me, I wasn\u2019t exceling in them. There is nothing like having passion for what you love doing with happiness even when the money is not there. You find out that being in the midst of your colleagues, you are just happy. He has seen that that particular thing that I have been talking about is what gives me joy, even if there is nothing coming in from it. So, he has no choice than to allow me do my thing and especially now that my kids are a bit grown up. I actually started in December with a movie. The next one is supposed to have been with Ernest Asuzu. Unfortunately, he is dead. That one is gone. However, I have been having offers, I am waiting for time to begin shoot.\n\nWhen did you partially left acting?\n\nI would say it was when the former governor of Akwa Ibom state, Godswill Akpabio invited us to Uyo. That was when Samuel Peters won his boxing bout. On my return from Uyo, I realized that there were not much job in the industry, I went back to Uyo and started work in an oil firm. In 2008, I, Emen Isong, Ini Edo, Darling Benson went to the United States to represent Akwa Ibom actors for an event.\n\nWhen I returned this time, I got married and started having my children.\n\nWhen are you producing your movie?\n\nI did a soap opera in 2014. We are still waiting for it to sell. You know how these things are. We need sponsors and with that we could do more. However, there is plan underway for movie production soon.\n\nAre you happy with the way the film industry has progressed or retrogressed from when you were very active and now?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormerly, government pretended that it had no business with the industry and everyone was doing their thing on their own. It is not that government has fully done much but during the time of President Goodluck Jonathan and Governor Akpabio, they really supported the industry. And the industry boomed. Even other governors became interested, after seeing the potential which the industry is capable of. We were everywhere. Well, it could be better.\n\nHow was growing up like?\n\nMy growing up was interesting. I grew up in a disciplined and hardworking home. My father was a disciplinarian and I thank God that my parents impacted that culture of discipline in me, even then when I used to behave like a tomboy. I would say I had a solid foundation.\n\nWho really influenced your going into acting?\n\nLiz Benson did it for me. I always wanted to be like her. I admired the way she acts and I get delighted watching her on screen. She greatly inspired my going into the Nollywood business.\n\nWhat movie were you popular with?\n\nIt was the Wale Adenuga Super Story drama when I played the part of \u2018Sandra\u2019 in No Pain, No Gain. It was an emotional and challenging drama. I played the part of a rich man\u2019s daughter that fell in love with Richard who unknown to her used her to become wealthy.

          "title": "TORA OLAIYA: Every milestone is memorable for me",
          "text": "Tora Olaiya is a woman of many talents. \u2013 a singer, model, TV presenter , lecturer and entrepreneur. In this interview with Yetunde Oladeinde, she talks about her passion for beauty and skincare, challenges, inspiration from her mum as well as the things she misses about her late uncle, Sir Victor Olaiya.\n\nTell us how you got into broadcasting?\n\nI\u2019ve been into broadcasting for many years; I started in London by obtaining a few certificates in broadcasting and production. Then I gained my professional experience in Nigeria. I got my first break hosting the overnight show on 99.3 Nigeria info FM Lagos and within a year I was hosting the Morning drive time on Cool FM. I would like to take this opportunity to give a big shout out to Mr. Onimisi Adaba and Mr. Nimi Oruye and the entire Cool, Wazobia, Info team for giving me the opportunity. They really didn\u2019t know me from a can of paint but they saw something in me and since then I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work as a presenter and a producer with some of the best broadcasting platforms in Africa including Spice TV and M-Net.\n\nWhat was the experience like at the beginning?\n\nIt was hard work but it was also fun because I was literally thrown in at the deep end. I hosted my first show by myself. I wasn\u2019t familiar with the equipment but I took to the challenge like a duck to water because I have a diploma in music technology which really helped me to learn the technical side of radio very quickly. The best thing for me was that I got to learn by working with some of the best broadcasters in the industry. People like Ali Baba, Olisa Adonis, IK Osakioduwa, Eku Edewor and so many more. They don\u2019t know it but they were like my unofficial mentors. I learnt so much by just watching them do their thing on air.\n\nWhat were you doing before that experience?\n\nBefore broadcasting I was a university lecturer. I taught in the Middle East and Europe before moving to Nigeria to pursue my passion (broadcasting). My goal is to explore the African Market at large, so I figured Nigeria was a good place to start.\n\nWhat are the other things that occupy your time now?\n\nNow I am an executive. I\u2019m a media consultant and broadcast specialist by trade. I have my own company called T.O.M consulting which is a subsidiary of Toriya Entertainment Limited. We specialize in all things media including production, media training and public relations. We\u2019ve been so blessed to have clients like Warner Music SA, Bet 9ija and Heineken to name a few. I am also the Chief Communications Officer for one of the biggest real estate developers in Lagos. They\u2019re called Dillon Consultants Nigera and they\u2019re expanding into the gas and banking sector. I manage the internal and external communications for the entire group. I\u2019m also producing a podcast with one of the biggest media platforms in Africa. I can\u2019t say much about it now, but expect to hear more about that very soon.\n\nWhat are the challenges you encountered?\n\nI like to see my challenges as lessons. Life lessons to help me grow. At the end of the day what doesn\u2019t kill you or break you can only make you stronger. A hard lesson I learnt was swallowing my pride and not being afraid to start again. I\u2019ve really mastered the art of being flexible and adaptable. But without compromising my principles. It\u2019s taken me a long time to get to this space and I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes along the way, but that\u2019s life. I believe the biggest lesson you can learn in life is to master yourself. It may sound a bit clich\u00e9, but that\u2019s one of the things that are very important to me. It\u2019s important that I\u2019m honest to myself as well as others. I\u2019m at a stage in my life where I say no to opportunities that people would kill for. I don\u2019t say no because I\u2019m too good. I say no because if it doesn\u2019t align with my goals and values, then I don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m no longer in the business of doing things just because I get a cheque or it\u2019s what people think I should be doing.\n\nWhat are some of the memorable moments in your life and career?\n\nWhen I look back on my career every milestone is memorable for me, just because I always speak what I want to do into existence. For example I wanted to be a TV and radio presenter (done that). I wanted to be a producer (done that). I wanted to start my own company (done that). I wanted to be an executive (doing that). Literally everything I set my heart on comes to pass and my career just keeps growing from strength to strength.\n\nWhat are some of the changes you would like to see in the sector?\n\nI would like to see more investment in the creatives industries for start. More structure in film, television, music, especially for the youth sector. We need more programs that support young people who are trying to get into the industry.\n\nWhat has been the experience in Real Estate?\n\nReal Estate has been so good to me. It\u2019s changed my life for the better. I\u2019m in a constant state of gratitude and my mindset has really evolved. I\u2019m really grateful to Dillon Consultants Nigeria for giving me the opportunity to grow and flourish doing what I know best (Communications). I feel blessed to be a part of one of the best when it comes to the real estate sector, because it\u2019s so much more than just selling and buying properties. To me, it represents generational wealth, black excellence and African opulence at its finest. Real estate empowers me and it inspires me to demand more of myself and to be the best I can be. Then there\u2019s the fact that I get to combine my passion for media and communications with real estate. Sometimes, I sit back and take it all in and I thank God for all my blessings.\n\nWhat are the new areas that you are looking at?\n\nI\u2019m happy you asked, because Dillon Consultants Nigeria is venturing into the gas and banking sector and I am part of the executive team that will be working on their expansion. Asides, from the corporate world I\u2019m also expanding my business portfolio into the skincare and beauty industry. Most people who know me know that I\u2019m a huge advocate for self-love and as a woman; I really believe that having confidence in your self-worth is the ultimate middle finger to anyone or anything that tries to put you down in anyway.\n\nWe go through life with so many unwarranted judgments and opinions directed towards us and for some women it can be a bit too much. That\u2019s why I\u2019m investing a lot of time and resources into developing my own natural luxury skincare brand, because as women, it\u2019s important that we take the time to take care of ourselves. The skincare, the hair care, eating right, exercising, traveling and relaxing. All of the little self-care routines that are often overlooked or thought of as vain, are really the little investments that we should put more time and effort into. I say this because; peace of mind is the ultimate flex for anyone. Therefore, it\u2019s important to focus on things that give us peace of mind.\n\nTell us about the people you admire?\n\nI admire my mother more than anyone else right now. Now that I am a young woman coming into my own. I understand her so much more than I ever did. Beyond that I respect and admire her hustle. By the time my mother was my age she had 4 children, real estate and businesses and she did a lot of it with my father being absent because of the nature of his job and lifestyle. My mum definitely wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon in her mouth. So, when I think about the start she gave me and my siblings in life, I really admire her for that. After my mother, it\u2019s my sisters and then it\u2019s Oprah Winfrey. I hope to meet her one day and have a conversation with her because she seems like someone who can talk about everything and anything.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWho or what do you consider as the greatest influence in your life?\n\nA really good question which I truly had to think about. I guess the thing that influences me the most is my drive and passion. The rest is God because without the most high I wouldn\u2019t have as much solid people in my life as I do now.\n\nWhat is your definition of style?\n\nI don\u2019t define my style because I focus on what is comfortable and what looks good on me. I really focus on dressing for my body type too. As far as a definition is concerned. I really couldn\u2019t give you one, because my style is forever changing and evolving. If I had to use one word I would call it flexible because really that\u2019s what it is. I adapt my style according to my environment.\n\nWhat message do you have for young people who want to go into the sector?\n\nSee it, believe it and give thanks before it comes. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you NO. For every door that closes another one will definitely open wider so just be ready when it does. For that you need to have the right attitude. Even in the most challenging time, your true test of character is how you come out on the other side of adversity. Anything worth having will never come easy, but find comfort in the fact that it will come as long as you stand the course of time. I would like to share something with you that my mother used to tell me. She used to say \u201cYou have to be in it to win it.\n\nYou studied music and your late uncle, Sir Victor Olaiya was a great inspiration to you. What do you miss about him and what does he mean to you?\n\nUncle Victor meant a lot to me and the entire Olaiya family. His intellect and creativity was second to none and we miss him every day. The thing I miss about him the most was his charisma. He was a very charming man and even towards the end of his life his charm shone through in his eyes and his smile. Even though he\u2019s missed, his legacy lives on in his children, family and his music and that\u2019s something that inspires me. My late father inspires me in the same way. Even though he died when I was very young, I inherited his passion and I know he\u2019s always with me. I believe my father and uncle Victor are both watching over me.",

          "title": "I like smart, God-fearing men \u2013Jemeriye Adeniji, singer",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nUS-based Nigerian singer/songwriter, Jemeriye Adeniji has performed across the globe. Recently, she played at the 70th birthday shindig of Mrs Nike Okundaye, proprietress of Nike Arts Gallery, which held at Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nAdeniji, whose Ewa Global Initiative showcases the beauty of Africa, in this interview dwells on her kind of man, among other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nWhat is the difference between being an artiste in the US and an artiste in Nigeria?\n\nI live in Pennsylvania. So, between the United States and Nigeria, we have some similarities and we have some differences. Music in Nigeria is different from music in the US. Their experiences and struggles are pretty different from each other. If you are not sure of yourself, or you are confused of your art, you\u2019ll get lost in the American system. For music, the more original you are, the better for you. The more original you are, the more they appreciate you. Americans celebrate what makes you tick; they embrace you when you are real. We have access to some things (in America) that we don\u2019t have access to here in Nigeria. As an artiste, you don\u2019t need to be a millionaire to own a stage. If you are good and you know what you do, you will be celebrated and appreciated when you stay true to your art. You will be seen and noticed. It is not about \u2018man know man\u2019 as it is here. Americans appreciate originality and sometimes you can have access to grants that could take your work to different level if you have good network.\n\nYou dress all covered up unlike most American artistes, what informed your style of dressing?\n\nFor me, you dress the way you want to be addressed. Dressing for me depends on how I feel. I want some respect and if I feel like dressing up, I dress up.\n\nWhat would you say about female artistes who show cleavages?\n\nThe truth is sex sells. Sometimes the struggle is real. Some of them believe if they are not dressed like that they won\u2019t be noticed or even heard. If your art has to do with the way you dress, be creative about it. Keep some decency to yourself, if you can. I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustles because I don\u2019t know what works for you. If exposing your body has helped you get to where you are going, merry Christmas and good luck. I don\u2019t like to knock anybody\u2019s hustles; it\u2019s a big market. If you think what you do is pleasant, keep it up. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustle.\n\nWhat\u2019s your kind of guy?\n\nI like smart men. Not too smart, though, not the type that wants to be in my nose that I can\u2019t even breathe. I like a man who is smart and disciplined. I like a God-fearing man, a man who appreciates and feels confident in his own woman and also in himself. I don\u2019t like a man who tries to control me and judge everything I do, and act like he owns me. As an artiste, you will not get to wherever you want with a man who is so domineering and possessive. I like a God-fearing man and a man who is understanding.\n\nDo you prefer a black or white man as a spouse?\n\nBlack is very sweet. White is sweet too. I\u2019m about the heart. If my heart connects with you, I can be younger or older; it doesn\u2019t matter to me. As far as you have a good heart, you care for me and I care for you too. Love has no colour, no age. Only you know what you feel. Others can say whatever they want.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Agitations: Nigeria\u2019s break up real \u2013Prophet Olagunju",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nThe division among Yoruba leaders over the quest for the independence of Yoruba nation will not affect the realization of the agenda. Prophet Wale Olagunju of Divine Seed of God Chapel Ministries, Ojoo, Ibadan, who made this known said despite the confusion over the seeming rivalry between the two Yoruba leaders, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Afenifere leader and Prof Banji Akintoye, leader of Ilana Omo Oodua, the dream for an independent Yoruba nation, remains the ultimate target of both groups.\n\nThe popular seer insisted in this interview that the Igbo, like the Yoruba, are also determined to leave Nigeria, maintaining that nothing will hinder their desire for an independent Biafra nation.\n\nHe also spoke on other major national issues.\n\nYou have been speaking about the break up of the Nigerian nation since 2002. Considering the agitations by the Yoruba and the Igbo, would you say this has a link to your prophecy?\n\nThe break up is real. You know God is not a man that He should lie. God has been revealing this to me since 2002 as you may have read it severally. I stand by that prophecy. One million Buharis cannot stop it. The misery of this break up was what the Lord revealed to me many years back that the man that God will use to achieve this purpose will emerge in 2015. So, definitely it is this Buhari. The Yoruba are determined to leave Nigeria and nobody can stop them, they are going. Another important thing behind the break up is the APC government. Why are they marginalising the Igbo? What is their offence? Why are they killing them on daily basis? To me their offence is simply because they want Biafra nation. You don\u2019t trust them. The northern elements do not trust the Igbo, they don\u2019t trust Yoruba, you don\u2019t want them to rule Nigeria and yet you are saying they should not go. Do you marry someone by force? To me only an irresponsible person will say the Igbo and the Yoruba should not go. Every generation has their own battle to fight before getting freedom just like the biblical Israelites. So, this generation must fight their own battle. Now is the time for the Yoruba to rise up.\n\nProf Banji Akintoye and Pa Ayo Adebanjo who are believed to be the leaders of the Yoruba are not on the same page as far as the agenda for an independent Yoruba nation is concerned. Don\u2019t you think this will create confusion which will may make the realization of the Yoruba agenda a tall dream?\n\nThere is nothing like rivalry between Pa Adebanjo and Emeritus Professor Akintoye. First and foremost, Pa Adebanjo is the leader of Afenifere while Emeritus Professor Akintoye is the leader of Ilana Omo Oodua. So, everything is in order. There cannot be any confusion, each of them is pursuing his own agenda and ultimately they will arrive at same junction.\n\nOn Senator Bola Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition come 2023, don\u2019t you see this in contrast wth the Yoruba agitation?\n\nYes, you are right. It shows that Tinubu is working against the interest of the Yoruba race. He is pursuing his own personal agenda at the expense of the entire Yoruba race and he will fail woefully. The picture of Tinubu in the heart of every Yoruba now is that of a traitor, the Yoruba will never support him and neither will the Igbo. If Tinubu is truly a Yoruba leader which he claimed to be, he should always be found allying with the Yoruba agenda. For someone who claimed to be fighting the course of his kinsmen and stylishly pursuing a different mission is not good. I make bold to say it, Tinubu is a traitor. Tinubu should learn from history, nobody has ever betrayed the cause of Yoruba and succeeded in life. Tinubu should readily see himself as failure which he is. We should not limit ourselves to Tinubu alone, we need to think about other people who claimed to be leading the Yoruba and are found in conspiracy with Tinubu, the majority of Yoruba people are seeing them as traitors and truly they are.\n\nThe death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua was recently announced; how did you receive the news?\n\nIt was a sad news, though the Lord had revealed it to me long time ago which I predicted. That does not mean I should be rejoicing over his death. I have read a lot of uncomplimentary remarks about his death, that does not concern me, my belief is that everyone of us shall give up the ghost one day and shall definitely give account of whatever we do in the flesh. So, those who are saying all sorts of things about Temitope Balogun Joshua after his demise are all wasting their time and saliva as they are not in position to judge him. My prayer is that God will forgive them.\n\nWe now seem to be in the era of civil protests in Nigeria. what is your take on this?\n\nWell, I am not in support of Buhari-must-Go protest, but I am in full support of that of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye for self-determination. I am not in support of Buhari must go protest even though it is in order, because it can never achieve any meaningful result. It is my belief that people need to learn from EndSARS protest. I don\u2019t understand what the current protest is aiming at. Are they saying Buhari should go or they want to force him to resign? It is a mere waste of time, resources and energy. They cannot force Buhari to resign. Buhari will not resign, in a country where tribalism reigns supreme, the northern people will stand solidly behind him. It will result in loss of lives and It is an impossible mission. The people organizing the protests should avoid losing innocent lives to security operatives who may counter their protests. What I advise Nigerians to do is just to stay indoors and pray fervently unto God just like the Israelites who cried to the Almighty God who heard their prayers. Nigeria is now in soup and, in fact, the hottest part of soup in the hand of General Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nYou know Nigeria is now in the hands of myopic leaders who are only out to loot. You discover now that they move from APC to PDP or from PDP to APC, to wherever they feel they will be able to make enough loot. This is rampant among the Southerners. Call me anything, I am not bothered, I fell in love with General Babangida\u2019s two party system with Option A4 and I believe it is the best for Nigeria. With that system, you don\u2019t have the opportunity to decamp and rejoin another party. Today, when I look at the situation in our country, I feel so bad. Look at what these politicians have done in the last 20 years, they have bastardized everything. I now begin to think if this is the same Buhari of 1983 now hobnobbing with looters of our treasuries. So, how do you want me to be praying for Nigeria under this situation. What I am doing now is what God has instructed me to do, to set up a Directorate of Divine Intercessory for the Yoruba nation, of which I am the director. You\u2019ll discover that Yoruba people need prayer in the face of this calamity, if we want to avoid it, we must pray. What is happening in the country today is a very terrible situation which requires urgent prayers failing which the entity called Nigeria may not survive.\n\nPresident Buhari and Nigeria are currently in the news for Twitter ban. What is your own view on Twitter ban by Nigeria?\n\nNigerians using twitter have never committed any offence to warrant the ban placed on them by their president. The Twitter management or whatever name you call them has the right to remove whatever they feel is not right for the world to see, after all they removed a post by the former United States President, Donald Trump and he did not as a result of that place any ban on US citizens from using Twitter. The ban Is wrong and uncalled for. For President Buhari to be threatening any Nigerian who uses Twitter with legal action is totally uncalled for, grossly immature and must be condemned by all.\n\nWhat do you make of the call by the self-acclaimed freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo popular called Sunday Igboho who has again called on the Fulani herdsmen to live the Southwest?\n\nThe fact of the case is that Alhaji Abdulai Yerima, the Arewa Consultative Youth President started this by calling on the Igbo to leave the North and nobody queried him for it. To me, Sunday Igboho is a Yoruba militant leader who never carried a gun. He saw that his people are being massacred on daily basis without the government doing anything about it. So, how does that become an offence? The Federal Government does not see anything bad in the herdsmen who are using three weapons: Juju, AK 47 as well as their trust in the Federal Government\u2019s backing; to fight other ethnic groups, but they are busy pursuing Sunday Igboho for fighting the course of his people. The action of the Federal Government is only helping in propagating the course of Sunday Igboho and the entire Yoruba race. The Yoruba people now see him as their saviour. What I think Sunday Igboho needs to do is to watch his tongue and should stop insulting Yoruba elders.\n\nWhat is your advice for the people and government of Nigeria?\n\nFirst and foremost, I am confused as to what advice I can give President Buhari who happens to be a chronic unrepentant tribalist. But not withstanding I will advise him to dissolve his present cabinet which consists of people with no idea on how to move Nigeria forward. He needs to inject fresh blood into his government. Let him scout for people with fresh and brilliant ideas, that can help to move the country forward. My advice to the Yoruba and Igbo is to seek the face of God in holiness and pray fervently unto God of Abraham who saved the Israelites from the hand of Pharaoh and the task masters to put an end to the marginalization and killing of Yoruba and Igbo and to take them to the Promised Land because the killing is getting out of proportion.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Asaba Accord: Southern governors are broken records \u2013Senator",
          "text": "By Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenator Abdullahi Adamu is representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District in the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nIn this interview, he indicted state governors for not doing enough to police their domains. He also lampooned them for frustrating restructuring. He spoke on other national issues: What do you make out of this current situation in the country?\n\nIt is the first time since I have come of age that somebody will just get up and say anything about the government and go scot free. A lot of people today sabotage this government by the day. Even people who are under oath are sabotaging this government today. So, what do you expect? Those who are willing and lurking by the corner to do bad have now got the leverage. They have now got people who are even in government who are not showing satisfaction, loyalty, patriotism. How do you expect somebody who has such tendencies to go along, just waiting for an opportunity? These are some of the issues that together have placed us where we are today. And nobody can single-handedly, no matter what power you give him, can get us out of this mess. It has to be all of us Nigerians to get us back on track. This is not to say that Buhari\u2019s government is blameless. I am not suggesting that at all. What I am saying is that we are contributing more to creating problem for the government than what we are doing to solving the problem of the government. This government is our government. It was elected. No matter what we say. The National Assembly has PDP, APGA there and the YPP, APC are there, so everybody is there. There are people from every part of this country in the National Assembly and also in the executive. Take a look at the federal cabinet. Every state in this country has a minister. Some even have two. The idea is that, they are supposed to bring value and add to Buhari\u2019s capacity. Where are they? What are they saying today? Is there anything in this country that says a minister cannot talk? If a governor can talk, a minister cannot talk? What are we are doing? Everybody just fold his hands and Buhari unfortunately for us, is not the talking type. If he were to open up, you will wish you are down the drain. But God has given him the capacity to absorb. It is part of the characteristics of a leader. Yes, there are certain things that have happened. Yes, also he was supposed to react and respond to, but we have people who are not patient. You saw a problem today and you want a solution today. I don\u2019t want to sound like I am justifying what you may see as failure, but I am giving my own thoughts as to why I think we are where we are and why I think most Nigerians who have the responsibility are not living up to their billing. If I am in government, you expect something from me. I am also part of government. I cannot exonerate myself. Most of us that say we are educated, even if you went to a missionary school, there was a contribution of this government in educating you. So, there is a contribution the public have made in preparing you to be where you are today and as a patriotic citizen, one would expect some level of concern, and the concern would not be genuine if you become a critic. Even a critic can be positively critical, but where it is just a matter of picking whatever you want to pick and then throw it out without caring about the implication, it is not good. It is just bad.\n\nRecently, there have been different groups with agitations here and there. The Southern Governors met in Asaba. They called it the Asaba Accord. In that accord, they called for many things, including the ban on open grazing, call for structuring. Why do you think these agitations are popping up now?\n\nThey are sounding like a broken record. You know what a broken record does? It cracks. I expected them to be more educated people with responsibility of governance. Each of those governors is under an oath for loyalty, for preservation of the sovereignty of this country. That means everyone of them is duty bound to stay away from any act or words that have the tendency of being perceived as being separatists. I was a governor for eight years. I know what the Governors\u2019 Forum is. I headed it for five years of my right years. Before that, I was chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum. So, the secretariat you see and the bureaucracy I set them up during my time. Those that took over from us we began to have a situation. This is because we are in a democracy and people will come from a zone and bring a shopping list to the president. There are people in the cabinet and the National Economic Council, National Council of States. They will get themselves out and come and talk for their states or their zone only. They hold meetings almost every year or twice. They have a meeting of all stakeholders, ranging from private citizens, captains of industry, who have made a mark, who are respected in some parts of the country. They hold meetings publicly and come out with a communique. Among them, are people who have served this government and they will make pronouncement against what the government is doing. Before the Asaba Accord, there was a meeting of all the state governors. About 36 of them were there. Less than a week of that meeting, some people came out and claimed Southern Governors Forum. There is nothing wrong with regional bodies. But these governors know the constitution and they know that every Nigerian has the right of movement and association. A right to pursue legitimate goals. These governors are saying no cattle or open grazing. What is the alternative? Have they provided any? If Northern governors come together and take a position, what will happen? What right have you to tell Nigerians not to move freely? If northern groups say no southern business in the area, how will that end up? There are killings of northerners going on in the South. If the North decides to retaliate, we will call it geniocde. What is happening to us? We only know about problems, but not solutions. People are openly calling for a break up of the country.\n\nPeople have attributed some of the agitations in the country to the leadership style of President Muhammadu Buhari. Do you agree?It is too wide a statement. When you\u2019re talking of somebody\u2019s leadership qualities, you don\u2019t just pass a judgment. We have the misfortune of combining situation with Boko Haram and other insecurity challenges. It is unfortunate. We must get one fact very clear. This thing didn\u2019t start with Buhari. Yes, there are a few cases and increase in insecurity. I cannot deny that. That will be unfair. But the major problem is the failure of state administrations to take up the issue of security seriously. Just like Buhari, every governor has taken an oath to protect the lives and property of the citizens. They get money from the Federation Account and also generate revenues from their states. These are the facts. We agree that the central government needs to handle the issue, but states have to play complementary roles in tackling the issues too. Go and take an inventory of the number of states paying salaries today. This is not just about Buhari. States are not paying salaries even with the Paris Club refunds and others they\u2019ve gotten. If you\u2019ve small problems from the various states, overtime, they aggregate and they become big problems. Suddenly, they refer to the problems as Buhari\u2019s problems. Every state governor has a responsibility to provide for their people. Nobody said Buhari was an angel. Nobody also said because Buhari is now president, every state governor should abandon his responsibility.\n\nWhy are these agitations on the rise?\n\nSome of these agitations are induced. Few years ago, were they talking about break up of the country? Why now? Political leaders are in support of what their people are doing. They cannot speak up and challenge them. They just lament. They want the president to handle it. They are talking about restructuring. What is new there? When you and I know that we passed a law in the National Assembly. We tried to free state assemblies, judiciary too. Is Buhari responsible for that? Local governments were created by law. We have tried to free them. Governors are opposed to it. Is Buhari responsible too? How long have we had this aberration? They operate a joint account with local governments. But do these funds go to them directly? I was a governor. Local givenments used to get their funds directly. We created some development areas. We followed the law. Not a dime was taken. Now, local governments can\u2019t execute projects. They don\u2019t see any money. Local governments don\u2019t even get their money. These issues are affecting our democracy. We want to give Buhari a bad name.\n\nEfforts were made by the National Assembly to free up the Local government and assemblies. Even the state judiciary as part of moves to restrcutire\u2026\n\nThat was part of restructuring. What is even this restructuring? Those saying they want us to take a look at the Exclusive Legislative List. We don\u2019t have to fight over restructuring. We have two chambers that can handle that. They were elected. This is our job. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the issues in Nigeria, you can bring these issues to the National Assembly. They don\u2019t want that. They want to blame the president. There is nowhere the president can alter the constitution. He can\u201dt even give an order for that to be done. And these agitators are educated people. Take the issues to us and Buhari will assent to it. We keep saying that Nigerians didn\u2019t write the constitution. Was it Buhari that wrote it? Why is everybody calling Buhari? It\u2019s sickening. There is a limit. Not that we can\u2019t talk. We have the capacity to do more. But what we won\u2019t take likely is for any part of this country to think that they have a louder voice. That is not true. When the North starts talking, maybe there will be sense. If we want this country to stay on, we will. I speak as a Nigerian of northern extraction. I will defend that as long as I live. Those who want to leave can go. We will continue to exist as one Nigeria. Let\u2019s see where they will go. Seperatists are taking laws into their hands and we are tolerating them. They shout about human rights. We need to stop. It won\u2019t do us any good. No country has survived two civil wars. Army generals have told me that. We must watch out and guide against another war. We should be careful about what we say. These agitators can go. But we will remain.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google earmarks $6 million to support African tech startups and women-led businesses",
          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How technology is helping this AC technician scale his business",
          "text": "Have you ever walked into a room and immediately started sweating bullets? Have you spent time in a room with air-conditioners that blow hot air?\n\nThen you would quite understand why I was happy when last year, after a lot of convincing and back and forth, my mom finally agreed to get two air-conditioners installed in the house. But, unfortunately, it gets incredibly hot in the dry season even though there are huge windows everywhere. So we contacted a former neighbour that sells used ACs, paid three-quarters of the money, and had him deliver them to the house.\n\nAfter the delivery and installation by Udoka, a very cheerful and outspoken \u201cAC installer\u201d, trouble started. The ACs were not cooling. Udoka was called back several times, the gas was filled and refilled, one split AC exchanged for a standing one, a total of four technicians worked on the cooling units, one AC unit almost caught on fire.\n\nSeveral months later, my parents had spent more than \u20a6250,000 ($524.1)* on ACs that never worked. They are still in the house, an immutable reminder of wasted money and time, and perhaps, another reason to be continually disappointed in Nigerian artisans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s why when we were asked to pitch possible stories for an article, the event \u201cWorld Refrigeration Day\u201d caught my attention. I was increasingly interested when I saw that this year\u2019s theme was \u201cCooling Champions: Cool Careers for a Better World.\u201d\n\nI was immediately transported back to the emotions I felt during the AC installation and repair saga. But, rather than focus on my frustrations, I began to ask questions. What would it take to start a career in the refrigeration industry? How much would it cost? What kind of tools and technology make the work easier?\n\nWorld Refrigeration Day\n\nSince 2019, World Refrigeration Day is celebrated every June 26. It is an international awareness campaign established by the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat to raise the profile of the refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump sector. It focuses on the significant role that the industry and its technology play in modern life and society.\n\nIt was the idea of refrigeration consultant, Stephen Gill, former President of the Institute of Refrigeration in the UK. It quickly caught on in its first year, with more than 800 physical events held in 153 countries around the globe.\n\nAccording to the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat, more than 15 million people are employed worldwide in the refrigeration sector, while the total number of refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump systems in operation worldwide is around 5 billion.\n\nQuite impressive statistics, but I was curious about how much of it Nigeria\u2019s economy accounts for, especially for the average AC or refrigerator technician.\n\nI spent some time with Emmanuel to try to answer this, and you\u2019ll find details below.\n\nThe learning process\n\nEmmanuel of Ipese Oluwa Technologies\n\nEmmanuel is an AC technician who runs Ipese Oluwa Technologies, a business in the student town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. The young entrepreneur graduated from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, as a Physicist in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like many OAU alumni before him, he saw a problem and decided to solve it. Before leaving school, he was already working as a cable TV installer. However, customers began to ask if he could repair ACs. Seeing the business opportunity, he decided to learn.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has 78 approved and accredited Vocational Enterprises Institutions (VEIs), with the latest getting approval in 2019. However, only two teach Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Practice, with a two or three-year study option. Some of these institutions give scholarships in conjunction with partners, but the rest require payment.\n\nInterestingly, Emmanuel didn\u2019t go down this route. Instead, he chose to learn from technicians in Ile-Ife and Benin City, Edo State. In 2014, he undertook the course for one and a half years and paid roughly \u20a6170,000 ($1062.5)** to learn but claims to have understood the basics in two weeks.\n\nApart from the traditional training, Emmanuel uses YouTube and Google as additional learning tools. For him, they are even more helpful than the conventional training.\n\n\u201cI learn so many things. I watch clips with different styles. It is very helpful,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter watching several hours of AC installation and work tools videos on YouTube myself, I am inclined to agree. But, interestingly, Nigerians are yet to join the DIY video trend.\n\nTools of the trade\n\nSource: United National Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nAn AC technician requires several important tools to get his work done \u2014 wrenches, pipe bending tools, manifold gauge, pliers, a pen and paper, protective equipment, and so on.\n\nFor Emmanuel, though, certain tools that would make his work easier include a vacuum pump, a drill and a Hi-Lift Jack. A vacuum pump is an essential tool used to repair cooling units to clean the compressor by removing unwanted air and water vapour.\n\nA drill is used to puncture the wall for the AC\u2019s pipes and wall brackets. A handheld drill would be a step up from the chisel and hammer Emmanuel currently uses. The videos I watched showed how technicians use it to create very clean-cut holes \u2014 a far cry from the ragged holes crude tools form.\n\nThis is important because, apart from aesthetics, you don\u2019t want air leaking out from spaces in the room.\n\nWhen it comes to quotes, he gives prices based on the type of building where the cooling unit is to be installed. This is because it takes a lot of effort to move the AC up the house using a ladder, a situation that can be avoided by using a lift that guarantees a safe and hassle-free operation.\n\nAll of these cost quite a bit of money. But these are not the only tools Emmanuel employs.\n\nLeveraging the Internet\n\nThe AC technician reveals that he uses websites like Jiji and Facebook for advertising his products and services.\n\nAccording to him, he has received referrals from those ads.\n\nI find this quite interesting because while searching Google for a cooling technician in the Ile-Ife area, his was the only name that immediately came up. Others were located in Osogbo (1 hour 22 minutes away), Ibadan (1 hour 29 minutes away), and Lagos (3 hours 53 minutes away).\n\nI would later to find others, but that involved a search on Instagram, Google, Olist and Facebook.\n\nAir-conditioning units\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nInevitably, our discussion veered into types of ACs, the most popular, and the best ones to use.\n\nIn Nigeria, the climate is tropical, semi-arid in the far north, and progressively rainier as you move southward. In the north, the temperatures become extreme depending on the season. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s scorching. When it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing.\n\nThe south has more temperate weather, but the country is quite hot. A fact most Nigerians can attest to.\n\nPresently, the market for single-split air-conditioners in Nigeria is set at approximately 560,000 units annually. LG leads the pack with an 11% market share, Samsung has 9%, Panasonic and Midea have 8%, Gree and Chigo have 7%, Daikin 5%, while Haier Thermocool and Hisense have 3%. The remaining market share belongs to lesser-known brands like Royal.\n\n86% of these cooling units are assembled in the country, with 14% of them imported. This is because, unlike the automotive sector, for example, Nigeria encourages local assembly of the cooling units by setting a lower import duty (5%) for completely knocked down units, compared to assembled units (20%)\n\nEmmanuel says most customers prefer to buy new units with brands like Hisense, Royal, and Midea as the most patronised due to their relative cheapness. Prices range from the \u20a6100,000s ($243.01) to the \u20a6500,000s ($1215.07). However, he resisted my pressure and declined to name the best brand.\n\n\u201cWhat might be my best might be different for you,\u201d he said.\n\nI certainly wished we had decided to buy new ACs right then.\n\nCool careers for a better world\n\nAccording to Numbeo, the average monthly net salary in Nigeria is \u20a671,945.53 ($174.84).\n\nWhen asked if he would be willing to switch jobs, Emmanuel said no. According to him, he earns more money working as an artisan than most salary earners. So in one sitting, he could make more than most people.\n\nMoney aside, he views his work with enthusiasm. His eagerness to answer questions and willingness to learn things that he previously did not know, and his dedication to attempting his best work, all shine through as we converse.\n\nHappy World Refrigeration Day as we all take a moment to appreciate the cooling technicians who keep our homes and work areas cool and serene enough for comfortable living.\n\nWe should also appreciate the man who invented the modern air-conditioner, Willis Carrier.\n\n*Black market rates, December 2020\n\n**Dollar equivalent in 2014",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "The decision by President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend his scheduled medical trip to London may not be unrelated to two main reasons: protocol and the lack of urgency of the medical treatment he requires.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth diplomatic and multiple non-diplomatic but reliable sources told our correspondent on Saturday that current COVID-19 protocols the UK require all non-essential travellers to quarantine before entry.\n\nExceptions are only made for emergencies or pre-arranged high level diplomatic travels. Buhari\u2019s visit does not fall within any of these categories.\n\nOur sources said, \u201cThe President would have been required to quarantine, perhaps for 10 days, because his medical trip is not an emergency and the law in the UK is not a respecter of persons. The requirement would not have been waived.\u201d\n\nIf Buhari had travelled, it would have been his eighth medical trip since he was elected six years ago.\n\nOur sources however said his cancelled Friday medical trip was not related to an undisclosed ailment which kept the President away in an undisclosed London hospital for over 107 days between May and August 2017.\n\n\u201cHis medical team made the decision that his Friday trip as neither an emergency nor a life-threatening one. Otherwise, he would have travelled and it\u2019s unlikely that the COVID-19 protocol might have stood in the way,\u201d our sources said.\n\nOne diplomatic source said, \u201cFrom what I have read in the news, it could be a medical reason why it was postponed, because it was a medical reason why he was reportedly going in the first place.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nResponding to insinuations by Nigerian protesters and opposition groups in London that the President could be shying away from being waylaid, the diplomat source said, \u201cEveryone is free to protest in the UK, so long as they do so within the law.\n\n\u201cAll sorts of groups protest in Whitehall outside the houses of parliament and Number 10 Downing Street all the time.\u201d\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to the President, Malam Garba Shehu, declined to answer questions about why the President\u2019s trip was postponed.\n\nOn Thursday, the Presidency publicly announced that Buhari would make a medical trip to London only to announce a postponed without reasons.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army yesterday said its troops killed scores of bandits and recovered arms and ammunition in fierce encounters in Zamfara State at the weekend.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director, army public relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops of the 8 Division, Nigerian Army while on a fighting patrol came under fire of bandits operating along Mayanchi-Dogo Karfe and Fagantama villages in Talata Marafa local government area of Zamfara State.\n\nIn the ensuing encounter, the troops overpowered the bandits, killing scores while seizing a large cache of ammunition and a motorcycle from them.\n\nGen. Nwachukwu said the troops also neutralized five bandits in another encounter at Bingi village in Bungudu local government area of the state.\n\nHe added that following the gun duel, the bandits withdrew in disarray, having sustained severe gunshot wounds.\n\nThe troops seized include an AK-47 rifle, one motorcycle and three mobile phones from the routed criminals in Bingi, Nwachukwu said.\n\nHe added that the chief of army staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, while appreciating the combat resilience and renewed vigour of the troops, urged them to sustain the aggressive posture in order to defeat all criminal elements operating in the North West and other parts of the country.\n\nHe urged communities in the region to support the troops with useful information at all times to enhance anti-banditry operations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a related development, sustained efforts by the military have engendered the return of relative peace in parts of the South East and South South that had been troubled by members of the outlawed Indigenous People of BiafrA (IPOB).\n\nOur correspondent reports that peace and tranquillity are gradually returning to particularly Imo State where militant groups regularly attacked security personnel and government establishments.\n\nImo, which was noted for calm and serenity, was almost taken over by hoodlums under the cover of secessionist agitation who took over the public space, shooting and destroying government property such as police barracks, INEC offices and killed law enforcement agents in the process while innocent citizens were not exempted from the list of casualties.\n\nHowever, with the recent efforts of the military, the unknown gunmen syndrome appears to have been unmasked and destabilized through superior gun fire.\n\nCivil servants and businessmen who previously abandoned their offices and shops have gradually returned to their various places of work.\n\nAn Owerri-based businessman, Chidi Ubaka, commended the efforts of the military on the restoration of peace in the state.\n\nHe said life is gradually returning to normalcy in the state after the reign of terror that engulfed it and urged the military to sustain the tempo.\n\nHe said businesses that were closed as a result of the disturbances appear to be bouncing back.\n\nChukwudi Uwaezuoke, an artisan, said the unfortunate confrontation and destruction of lives and property represented an \u201cugly wind that blows no one any good\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that Imo is known for peace and hospitality and commended the military for the effort.\n\nThe Imo State Police Command assured the populace that peace has been restored in the state.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, who gave the assurance while interacting with LEADERSHIP Sunday in Owerri, urged residents of the state to go about their lawful businesses and advised hoteliers and other business owners to take advantage of the improved security situation in the state.\n\nHe said the security measures already in placed were presently yielding results and solicited an all-society approach to improve on it.\n\n\u201cSome of the security measures we have put in place include visibility policing and robust vehicular patrols within the metropolis and its environs. This is to ensure that night life which the people of Imo State are known for is returned in full scale,\u201d he said.\n\nYaro added that adequate security measures had been put in place to protect lives and property, in addition to the military effort.\n\nSimilarly, the military has curtailed attacks by IPOB in Asaba, Delta State and its environs.\n\nAttacks by IPOB were earlier noticed in Asaba, Agbor and the surrounding communities which are Ibo speaking, especially with its proximity to Onitsha in Anambra State.\n\nOn many occasions, members of the group had demonstrated, attacked innocent residents and were involved in killing and destruction of property.\n\nA representative of the Commander, 63 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Asaba, who is also the brigade\u2019s Chief of Staff, Col N.E. Okoloagu, assured that the activities of such people would no longer be seen in the state.\n\nHe said when he led an entourage to the Asagba of Asaba, Obi Prof Joseph Chike Edozien in his palace that traditional rulers should help to sensitize subjects on matters that would help security agencies to be proactive in fighting insecurity.\n\nHe urged the members of the community to partner with the Army to maintain peace.\n\nIn his response, the Asagba of Asaba thanked the brigade commander for his gesture and assured the Army of his support at any time, especially on security matters.\n\nSimilarly, Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has dispelled claims by lPOB that Anioma in Delta State was part of Biafra.\n\nOkowa said; \u201cBiafra agitation, we have criticized it. Anioma land as it is said, from here, was part of Bendel State, it was part of the Midwest Region.\n\n\u201cWe were never part of the South East and obviously we cannot be said to be part of them. We may speak the same language but we were never part of the South East. We were part of the old Midwest, we were part of Bendel, we are now Delta State and we are Deltans,\u201d he said\n\nAfter the clash in Ohafia between soldiers and suspected members of IPOB and the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the fear of insecurity has subsided across Abia State.\n\nFollowing this, the government has through a statement signed by the commissioner for information, John Okiyi Kalu, relaxed the curfew hitherto imposed across the 17 local government areas.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn view of noticeable security improvements within the state and the neighbouring states, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has directed the relaxation of the existing curfew in the state.\u201d\n\nThe statement dated June 18 said government wished to advise residents to remain vigilant, and report suspicious movements around them to security agencies to ensure full compliance with the curfew.\n\nGo, Destroy Terrorists\u2019 Enclaves\u2014COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, has charged troops of Sector 2 Joint Task Force North East Operation HADIN KAI to destroy all Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province terrorists\u2019 enclaves in their various locations.\n\nHe gave the charge while addressing troops of Sector 2 in Damaturu, Yobe State, yesterday.\n\nIn a statement by the Director Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, the COAS further commended the troops on the wealth of battle experiences acquired through successful operations conducted within Sector 2 Area of Responsibility including, Operation Ayiso Tamunoma, Katana Jimlan, Fire Ball and Operation Tura Takaibango among others.\n\nGeneral Yahaya enjoined the troops to use the lessons learnt from the series of operations to destroy the remnants of the marauding terrorists within their area of responsibility.\n\nHe assured them of improved welfare and a new reward system for troops who perform gallantly in any operation.\n\nEarlier, the Commander, Sector 2 Joint Task Force North East HADIN KAI, Brigadier General Adamu Nura, while welcoming the COAS, briefed him on the operational engagements and challenges in the sector.\n\nBoko Haram/ ISWAP Form Battle Alliance\n\nMeanwhile, following the death of the factional leader of the Boko Haram terrorists, Abubakar Shekau who reportedly blew himself to avoid being captured by Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters, Boko Haram fighters have formed alliance with commanders of ISWAP.\n\nThe reunion was contained in a viral video which was monitored by LEADERSHIP Sunday in Maiduguri yesterday showed Boko Haram and ISWAP ISWAP commanders placing their palms on top of each other and chanting words of solidarity as a sign of fraternity.\n\nIn the over 13 minutes video, the terrorists of both camps pledged their allegiance to one Aba Ibrahim Al-Hashimiyil AlKhuraishi, whom they unanimously described as \u2018Khalifan Muslimai\u2019, translated as \u201cThe Leader of all Muslims\u201d.\n\nFour insurgents, drawn from the defunct Boko Haram and ISWAP sects, in the clip, were seen pledging their loyalty to their new commander while speaking in Arabic, Hausa, English and Fulfulde.\n\nOne of the speakers confirmed the report that intelligence services played critical roles in creating divisions in the camps of the terrorists when he said the enemies succeeded in dividing them, but added that they were now back.\n\nA terrorist who first spoke extended his greeting to their new leader, Khuraishi, thanking him for bringing them together.\n\nPledging his loyalty, he said every member of Boko Haram and ISWAP should be happy that they are now united.\n\nAnother terrorist speaking in Hausa, greeted Al-Hashimiyil Khuraishi, assuring that he and his colleagues would not flout his orders and commandments.\n\nHe expressed delight that they were back as one \u2018indivisible entity\u2019, after the mutual hatred that hitherto divided them, gave way.\n\nAnother ISWAP fighter who was wielding a sophisticated gun hung on his neck, said; \u201cWhat is left now is jihad. We will not stop fighting the unbelievers. All the disbelievers have entered trouble.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, every Boko Haram and ISWAP member must be ready to fight under the directive of their new leader for them to survive and succeed.",

          "title": "APC Governors, State Chairmen Back Buni\u2019s Extension",
          "text": "Governors and other stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday endorsed the fresh extension granted to the Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThey noted that the extension will afford the party enough time opto plan for nationwide congresses ahead of the national convention.\n\nRecall that the Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee got a second extension Friday.\n\nThe Buni-led Committee which was inaugurated on June 25 at an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) with a six-month mandate to reconcile warring tendencies in the party and convene an elective national convention within the period had initially got a six-month extension in December 2020.\n\nBarely months into office, some members had read its body language and concluded that the committee was not working towards conducting a national convention within the mandated six-month period, and may get an extension.\n\nRecall that the ousted Adams Oshiomhole group did not only fight the initial extension but its legality.\n\nLast week, a Federal High Court in Abuja struck out two suits challenging the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party and seeking to void the succeeding National Caretaker Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai-Mala Buni.\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo, in two rulings on Tuesday held that the plaintiffs lacked the locus standi (the legal right) to institute their cases against the party.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe first suit was filed by a former South-South National Vice Chairman of the party, Hilliard Eta in the name of APC, while the second suit was instituted by a former APC Youth Leader in Abia state, Kalu Kalu Agu.\n\nThey had prayed the court to reverse the dissolution of the Oshiomhole-led NWC and declare the Buni-led NWC unlawful.\n\nHowever, as prelude to this second extension, governors elected on the platform of the party during the week passed a vote of confidence on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nKebbi State Governor and Chairman of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Senator Atiku Bagudu, who made this known while addressing newsmen at the end of their meeting on Wednesday night, commended the caretaker committee for reinvigorating the party at a \u201ccritical time\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe vote of confidence is imperative to encourage the leadership of the party to continue its strides in piloting her to its next level.\u201d\n\nHowever, the caretaker committee for the Ogun State chapter yesterday said it has no opposition \u201cwhatsoever and howsoever\u201d with the decisions of the national leadership of the party as far as the forthcoming national congress of the party was concerned.\n\nThe state publicity secretary for the Caretaker Committee of the party in Ogun, Ambassador Tunde Oladunjoye, who spoke with LEADERSHIP Sunday in Abeokuta, the state capital, said the electoral law has affirmed the supremacy of the national leadership of every political parties on matters concerning the running of the affairs of the party.\n\nWith particular reference to the tenure elongation for the national Caretaker Committee of the party, Oladunjoye said it does not have any negative implication on the Ogun State chapter, noting that all the 36 States of the federation, including the FCT also have Caretaker Committee overseeing the affairs of APC at state levels.\n\n\u201cSo, in Ogun State, we have no opposition whatsoever and howsoever to whatever the party may have done at the national levels,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, chairman of the caretaker committee in Kaduna State, Commodore Emmanuel, JeKada (rtd.) said the tenure extension \u201cis in good direction because what is worth doing at all is worth doing well\u201d.\n\nHe told LEADERSHIP Sunday that \u201ca lot of people who left are returning back, so extending their tenure is for their jobs to be well completed.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the party in Oyo State expressed its preparedness for the congresses in the party in the state.\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman, Dr. Abdulazeez Olatunde, in an interview with LEADERSHIP Sunday in Ibadan, disclosed that the party had shaped up for the exercise.\n\nHe stated that blocs within the party had come into one force with the aim of participating in the congresses.\n\n\u201cAs a party we have prepared for the congresses and we are ready for it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the extension of the tenure of the convention committee, Olatunde said it was to give time legal backing to the committee.\n\nWhile noting that the committee had restored the party\u2019s lost glory, he said it had over stretched and over worked itself in restoring members\u2019 confidence.\n\nHe said the committee\u2019s works had paid off as more members including governors are now joining the APC.\n\nThe party in Osun State noted that it has no problem participating effectively in the forthcoming congresses of the party.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Sunday, the APC director of media, research and strategy, Barrister Kunle Oyatomi, said Osun APC is committed to working with whosoever is at the helm of affairs at the national level.\n\nIn Lagos State, the publicity secretary of APC, Hon. Seye Oladejo said, \u201cLet me just say the most important thing for us is that the congresses will hold eventually, so definitely Lagos State will not do anything different from what is happening generally in the party. What is happening is that the congresses will hold eventually and democracy will prevail and the entire membership of the party will be happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe APC spokesman in Ekiti state, Hon Ade Ajayi, said the state chapter of the party is in tune with the decision of the national leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are in tune with our leader. It is for the good of the party. There is no way we can do otherwise when making such a decision.\n\n\u2018\u2019The party in the state had on Friday inaugurated a seven member Electoral Committee to oversee the forthcoming party congresses in the state.\n\nIn the same vein, the chairman of the party in Kwara State, Alh Abdullahi Samari has described the elongation of the tenure of the national caretaker committee of the party as a welcome development.\n\nSamari who spoke with LEADERSHIP Sunday said the extension will allow for proper organisation of the APC national convention and states\u2019 chapters congresses.\n\nHe said Kwara\u2019s chapter of the party is fully prepared and ready for the conduct of its congresses.\n\n\u201cOnce we receive the necessary materials for the congresses from the national secretariat of our party, we are good to go.\n\n\u201cMy only appeal to the national caretaker committee is to put necessary measures in place to ensure a peaceful conduct of the exercise,\u201d Samari stated.\n\nSimilarly, a contender for the national chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Malam Salihu Mustapha said the extension granted the national caretaker committee of the party is expedient.\n\nMustapha spoke with LEADERSHIP SUNDAY, said \u201cThe APC is showing examples of excellent party administration to the rest of the political parties in Nigeria. What would ordinarily be rancorous and litigious in other parties is what the APC leadership has seamlessly and almost effortlessly pulled without lifting a finger.\u2019\n\nOn the extension of the timelines for the Caretaker Committee, he said \u201cI believe this is the most expedient for the party at this material time. The leadership has taken the decision in the overall best interest of the party.\n\n\u201cAs stakeholders in the party, we have no option than to support the decision with a bid to ensure that the party delivers on its mandate.\u201d\n\nAccording to a chieftain of the party in Kaduna State, Senator Abubakar Girei, \u201cthe APC Caretaker committee has been given additional assignments to further reposition the party. They have been able to do a lot and are still doing more to reposition the party towards an overwhelming victory in all elections before 2023 and also ensuring that the party emerges victorious at the 2023 general elections.\u201d",

          "text": "Rabiatu Adamu, 18, had felt a prick on her foot during a visit to her father\u2019s farmland to fetch firewood, but she thought that she stepped on thorns, alas; Rabiatu later discovered that she has been bitten by a poisonous snake in her Duguri village, 178km away from Bauchi metropolis, the seat of government.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen LEADERSHIP met Miss Rabiatu in her village, she was deft-handedly chasing flies with a hand-held fan from the wound she sustained on her foot as a result of snakebite, just as she looked excruciatingly exhausted from the swelling of her leg and face, having suffered for 8 months without proper medical attention.\n\nIncidentally, Duguri district is the home town of Bala Mohammed, the incumbent governor of the state. Duguri village, an agrarian settlement in Alkaleri local government area shares borders with Gombe from the east and Plateau State from the south.\n\nAisha said apart from the devastating pains of the snake bites she is suffering from, her father\u2019s inability to foot medical expenses that would see her get treatment in either Kaltungo, Gombe State or Plateau State was also a source of concern.\n\n\u201cI was working in the bush to fetch firewood when I felt like I stepped on thorns. I came home thinking I stepped on thorns in the bush but four days later, we realised it was a snake bite.\n\n\u201cAt a point, I almost lost hope because I thought I was going to die. As you can see, I\u2019m still suffering from the snake\u2019s venom and the wounds it has caused on my leg,\u201d Rabiatu told our reporter in her hopelessness,\u201d she said.\n\nRabiatu is relying on the assistance of the only female traditional herbalist offering \u2018treatment\u2019 in the village.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe treatment she gives is very cheap, you only need to pay N10, and two chickens to get treated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have no one to support us except God the Almighty. For the past 8 months, she is unable to do anything for me and anyone else.\n\n\u201cI feel like I am a burden to the household these days. Unfortunately, the snakebite clinic which was started a year ago is now lying fallow, with an empty uncompleted building.\u201d\n\nWhile Rabiatu continues to feel the excruciating pains resulting from the snakebites, Adamu Samaila, her father shares the agonies his daughter continues to face, \u201cfor lacking the financial wherewithal to foot her medical bills.\u201d\n\nAdamu said since October 2020 when the snake bit his daughter, he has been battling double jeopardy, \u201cI am emotionally troubled because I wake up every day to see her terrible condition and I lack the means to help\u201d.\n\nFetching firewood to support the household according to Adamu has been the routine of his children including Rabiatu.\n\nAdamu said since the time of Isa Yuguda, the communities have been struggling to get a snakebite clinic and their hope was emboldened when Governor Mohammed\u2019s administration laid a foundation to build one for them.\n\n\u201cAgain, we got exasperated when the project was abandoned halfway, we are only left with an empty building and dissipating hope about the possibility of having a snake bite clinic here,\u201d Adamu said\n\nHurera Ibrahim, the herbalist treating victims of snakebite in Alkaleri told LEADERSHIP that she was chosen by her late father who instructed her to carry forward the noble chore of treating victims of snakebites shortly before his demise.\n\nShe said that she has been curing victims of snakes from Alkaleri, Kafi, Daji, Rimi and Balele where snakebite has become the order of the day, while also noting \u201cI can keep about ten victims of snakebites in my house and treat them.\u201d\n\nHurera explained further that for the past 40 years, she has done nothing other than treating snakebite patients for as little as ten naira and two chickens, an instruction she said was passed down to her by her late father.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I collect from the people patronising my service is ten naira and two chickens but where a patient cannot afford to give ten naira and two chickens, at the end of a successful treatment, I ask them to leave the fee, because I will look for the required chickens and slaughter for them.\n\n\u201cWhy I am collecting ten naira only from the patients coming to this place is because when my father was spearheading the cure, he collected just three kobo and two chickens,\u201d she said.\n\nFlaunting her \u2018extensive knowledge\u2019 of snakebite, Hurera noted that different kinds of snake poisons require a different herbal mixture appropriate for the venom.\n\n\u201cI can boast of 10 different types of anti-snake venom herbals which I apply to various cases of snakebites being reported to me.

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

Local government is created with the ultimate goal of bringing government closer to the grassroots. It is aimed at accelerating development at the bottom-levelled tier through the holistic participation of the local population. Several people have decried how the third tier of Government has been deprived, denied and dragged down by the other superior tiers in Nigeria. I make bold to say that these power differentials and asymmetry that have accounted for reasons why those at the grass roots have continued to entirely suffer with no access to their deserved democratic dividends.\n\nDespite the popular endorsement of local government as a potent system to mobilize people for local participation in governance, what we have seen so far is that the state governments have taken over the statutory functions of the local government. Local governments now suffer from paucity of fund resulting in inability to cater for their basic responsibilities. As an authority in local government administration in Nigeria, It is necessary I join align my voice with others that for our local government to be efficient in administration and free from the unbridled interference \u2013 perhaps its hijack \u2013 by the state governments, there should be a clinical review of the constitution to make local governments truly autonomous especially on the issues of fiscal powers, functions and responsibilities.\n\nI opine strongly that the local government should be empowered to own the discretion and right to manage its resources by itself, just like the state government and Federal Government, the second and first tiers of government. The recent attempt by the House of Representatives to delist the local government as the third tier of government is not only shocking, disappointing, but in the eye of the sane public bereft of logic. It was as though in the minds of the proponents of the delisting, the third tier constitutes the bulk of the challenges Nigeria is faced with, hence the urgent need for its delisting or eradication. For the records, 52.68 per cent of the FAAC distribution goes to the Federal Government, 26.72 per cent goes to the state governments, while the remaining 20.60 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government, therefore leaving the local Government at the mercy of the State Government.\n\nThis is plus the fact that the state governments enjoy other means of funding. From the finance act 2020, 14 per centg goesto the Federal budget, 1 per cent to the Federal Capital Territory, 4 per cent to the Federal Inland Revenue Service being the Collector, and 50 per cent go to the State Government, 35 per cent to the local government. The 35 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government. This should bother every right-thinking Nigerian. Ideally the Local Government is supposed to be the delivery authority on Pre- primary, primary, adult and vocational education, agricultural and national resource development, primary health care, water systems, town planning, environment and public sanitation comprising the refuse collection and disposal, cemeteries and crematoria, slaughterhouses among other areas. Also parks and open spaces within the locality. It is very unfortunate, to say the least that almost all of these core duties of the local government have been taken over by the state government. The local government has been paralysed, and no wonder there is increase in crime since every criminal is from a locality. I hold a strong view that the effort of the state governments and local governments are supposed to be complimentary. The reason most minor roads are bad in Nigeria, even in Lagos, is because the Local Government System is near zero in capacity and competence.\n\nThe performances up and down the ladder are what is required for a working democracy that will allow everyone to benefit from its dividends. The National Union of Local Government Employees\u2019 Leadership was absolutely right when it warned the House of Representatives not to even entertain a debate of such matter, let alone giving it serious consideration. What we need an amendment of the constitution that will grant autonomy, more importantly the financial autonomy, to the Local tier, proscribe the State Independent Electoral Commission and allow local government elections to be conducted at the same time as the general elections. The present system that empowers the governors to principally direct the affairs and decide what happens at the local government level needs to be abolished. Whether politically, or in any other sense, it won\u2019t still be correct to continue this way.\n\nIt has not worked and no matter how we try, it will never work. This current provision of the constitution which allows the state government to provide for the establishment, structure, composition, finance and functions of local councils ridicules the expected autonomy the local government administrators should ordinarily enjoy since their decisions and relevance are determined by their governors. What we have today as chairmen of local governments are special assistants to their various governors on community mobilisation with no executive power to really make things work for the progress of their local councils. In granting a local council autonomy, the State Joint Local Government Account where monthly allocations are paid into should be split, with each tier receiving and absolutely responsible for the distribution of its resources (allocation).\n\nRather than debate how the Local Government system would be delisted as a tier of government in Nigeria, the National Assembly is hereby advised that what is necessary is the amendment of the constitution to clearly establish the three tiers of government and declare the local government as an autonomous unit of the federation and clearly spell out the powers and functions of the local government. Until greed crept in through the governors, the three tiers of government were designed to complement one another in the delivery of dividends of democracy to the citizenry. To therefore empower the struggling tier is the way to go. To suggest or attempt its delisting will only further rubbish our democracy. Strengthen the local government system and many of the challenges we are faced with, including insecurity and unemployment, will be thrashed.\n\nAdetuberu, PhD, writes in from AdoEkiti, Ekiti State.",

What we need an amendment of the constitution that will grant autonomy, more importantly the financial autonomy, to the Local tier, proscribe the State Independent Electoral Commission and allow local government elections to be conducted at the same time as the general elections. The present system that empowers the governors to principally direct the affairs and decide what happens at the local government level needs to be abolished. Whether politically, or in any other sense, it won\u2019t still be correct to continue this way.\n\nIt has not worked and no matter how we try, it will never work. This current provision of the constitution which allows the state government to provide for the establishment, structure, composition, finance and functions of local councils ridicules the expected autonomy the local government administrators should ordinarily enjoy since their decisions and relevance are determined by their governors. What we have today as chairmen of local governments are special assistants to their various governors on community mobilisation with no executive power to really make things work for the progress of their local councils. In granting a local council autonomy, the State Joint Local Government Account where monthly allocations are paid into should be split, with each tier receiving and absolutely responsible for the distribution of its resources (allocation).\n\nRather than debate how the Local Government system would be delisted as a tier of government in Nigeria, the National Assembly is hereby advised that what is necessary is the amendment of the constitution to clearly establish the three tiers of government and declare the local government as an autonomous unit of the federation and clearly spell out the powers and functions of the local government. Until greed crept in through the governors, the three tiers of government were designed to complement one another in the delivery of dividends of democracy to the citizenry. To therefore empower the struggling tier is the way to go. To suggest or attempt its delisting will only further rubbish our democracy. Strengthen the local government system and many of the challenges we are faced with, including insecurity and unemployment, will be thrashed.\n\nAdetuberu, PhD, writes in from AdoEkiti, Ekiti State.",
          "summary": "Several people have decried how the third tier of Government has been deprived, denied and dragged down by the other superior tiers in Nigeria.\nLocal governments now suffer from paucity of fund resulting in inability to cater for their basic responsibilities.\nThis is plus the fact that the state governments enjoy other means of funding.\nI hold a strong view that the effort of the state governments and local governments are supposed to be complimentary.\nStrengthen the local government system and many of the challenges we are faced with, including insecurity and unemployment, will be thrashed.",

          "title": "Hong Kong pro-democracy paper Apple Daily confirms closure -NigPilot",
          "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily announced Wednesday it will print its final edition after authorities arrested staff and froze its assets using a sweeping new national security law, silencing the city\u2019s most China critical media outlet. The decision is the latest blow to Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and deepens unease over whether the international finance centre can remain a media hub as China seeks to stamp out dissent. Small crowds gathered outside the paper\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday evening, shouting messages of support and shining mobile phone lights as journalists put together the swansong edition. Reporters said they planned to print one million copies overnight \u2014 a staggering number given Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million population.\n\n\u201cI have tens of thousands of words in my heart but I am speechless at this moment,\u201d Ip Yut-kin, chairman of the paper\u2019s parent company Next Digital, told AFP. Apple Daily has long been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, with unapologetic support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China\u2019s authoritarian leaders. Those same leaders have used a new security law to bring about its rapid demise. Owner Jimmy Lai, currently in jail for attending democracy protests, was among the first to be charged under the law after its imposition last year. But the final chapter of the 26-year-old paper was written over the last week when authorities deployed the security law to raid the newsroom, arrest senior executives and freeze its assets. That last move crippled the paper\u2019s ability to conduct business and pay staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple Daily announced its closure \u201cout of consideration for the safety of its staff\u201d. Its website will go offline overnight. Some 1,000 people have lost their jobs. The government-run science park that hosts the paper\u2019s headquarters also chose Wednesday evening to announce that the company was in breach of its lease and that legal steps were being taken to seize the building. \u2018Chilling\u2019 \u201cHong Kongers lost a media organisation that dared to speak up and insist on defending the truth,\u201d eight local journalist associations said in a joint statement, as they called on colleagues to dress in black on Thursday. British foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused Hong Kong\u2019s authorities of spearheading a \u201cforced closure\u201d of the paper, describing it as \u201ca chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices\u201d.\n\nChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests. The prosecution of Apple Daily was sparked by articles and columns that allegedly supported international sanctions against China, a view now deemed illegal. Lai, chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung have all been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China\u2019s national security and remanded into custody. On Wednesday Yeung Ching-kee, one of the paper\u2019s top columnists, was arrested on the same charge. The decision to freeze Apple Daily\u2019s assets also laid bare the sweeping powers now at the disposal of Hong Kong authorities to pursue any company deemed to be a national security threat.\n\nMultiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city\u2019s mini-constitution. But many local and international outlets are questioning whether they have a future there. \u201cEvery journalist in Hong Kong now has a metaphorical gun pointed at their heads,\u201d Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school, told AFP. \u201cWhen the result of your writing can lead to lifetime imprisonment -\u2013 you are being censored. Apple will not be the last \u2014 just the latest.\u201d First trial Hong Kong has plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year. Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea. China and Hong Kong\u2019s authorities have hailed the security law for successfully restoring stability after the 2019 demonstrations and said media outlets must not \u201csubvert\u201d the government.\n\nAuthorities initially said the law would only target \u201ca tiny minority\u201d. But it has radically transformed the political and legal landscape of a city that China promised would be able to keep key liberties and autonomy after its 1997 return. On Wednesday the first trial under the new law got under way for a man accused of riding a motorbike into police officers. His trial is not being heard by a jury in a major departure from Hong Kong\u2019s common law traditions. His case is unusual because he is the only Hong Konger so far charged under the security law with an explicitly violent act. More than 60 people have now been charged under the law, including some of the city\u2019s best-known democracy activists, but their offences are related to political views or speech that authorities have declared illegal.",

          "title": "Deep Impact: How COVID-19 Exposed The Education Sector\u2019s Digital Flaw",
          "text": "Solomon Elusoji\n\nKemi Ogunsanya, 29, studied English Education at the University of Lagos. After graduation she wasn\u2019t inclined, at first, to teach. But after several failed job applications, she returned to the classroom, this time as an instructor. And, for seven years, she hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nWhen Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Education ordered the closure of all schools to limit the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, Kemi\u2019s students \u2013 aged seven to 11 \u2013 were just about to commence examinations. \u201cIt was a bit destabilising,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we knew we were going to continue online.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s school made the transition to online learning using tools such as Zoom and Class Dojo. To \u201cthoroughly engage\u201d her students, she picked up skills in cartoon animation and visual design, and researched techniques on how to gamify learning. \u201cI wanted to captivate my students\u2019 attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that if it was boring, students would not enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOf course there were challenges \u2013 the regular limitations of Internet data and power supply. And since online learning requires a lot of parent participation, she had to keep constant tabs on parents to ensure student attendance and prompt submission of class assignments.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of effort, but it wasn\u2019t a wasted year,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cNow that schools have resumed, there are some slides and videos I created then that we are still using now. And the students still enjoy them.\u201d\n\nBut for millions of students enrolled in public or rural schools in Nigeria, the school closures halted formal learning, according to more than a dozen teachers who spoke to Channels Television. For months, students were cut off from their instructors. The use of digital technology to communicate was not an option as most children who attend public, rural schools come from poor homes with no access to smartphones or the Internet. The Ministry of Education in several states tried to reach students through mass produced radio and television programs, but the impact was minimal at best. \u201cTeaching did not stop,\u201d one teacher said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t tell if learning took place.\u201d\n\nAn unfair advantage\n\nAdaobi Amadi, 34, had always wanted to be a teacher. When she was younger, she had her own make-shift school, complete with a blackboard and chalk, where she taught her neighbours. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when she took up teaching after graduating from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa, with a degree in Applied Biochemistry.\n\nToday, she teaches Chemistry to students between 13 and 18 at a public school in Port Harcourt.\n\nWhen schools were closed in March 2020, she thought, at first, it was going to be a one-month holiday. But the months continued to meld into one another and she began to feel an emotion she described as \u2018panic\u2019. While her son, who attends a private school, was receiving lectures online from home, she was cut off from her students. \u201cAt that point, it became kind of stressful,\u201d she said.\n\nAn online learning approach would never work for Adaobi\u2019s students. Most of them came from families with no access to smartphones or laptops, talk less of Internet data. \u201cIn my school, there are students who come to me and say, we haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. Majority of them are domestic workers. We do have a sprinkling who come from middle-class homes, but those are very few.\u201d\n\nWhen schools began to reopen in the later part of 2020, Adaobi said \u201cthe drop in performance was glaring.\u201d Teachers tried to review what had been taught in the past months and holidays were shrunk. The Christmas break didn\u2019t extend much beyond a week, as efforts to gain ground intensified.\n\nAdaobi said school hours were also reduced from six to three hours as authorities moved to comply with social distancing regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cPrivate schools have maintained their schooling schedules,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get like six hours of schooling. And my students get only three hours. And it\u2019s the same syllable they are supposed to cover and the same examinations they are supposed to sit for.\u201d\n\nShe observed that the questions in the last set of external exams her student wrote seemed to have been easier than previous ones. Perhaps, she mused, the examination bodies had considered the impact of the pandemic on student performance. (A WAEC spokesman told Channels Television the examination body \u201cwill never compromise on standards or integrity\u201d of its tests)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that will happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams. Private school students not only got the online classes that they did, then when schools resumed they continued with their normal schedule. So they are prepared. But public school students are not.\u201d\n\nAn inadequate government response\n\nNigeria is not the only country where the pandemic disrupted education. According to UNICEF, about 1.2 billion learners were out of school and 73.8% of the world\u2019s school population were affected by school closures as a result of efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn paper, the Federal Government developed several initiatives to ensure students continued to learn despite the pandemic lockdowns, through the Nigeria Education Sector COVID-19 Response Strategy set up by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nThe strategy included plans for the Learn at Home Programme (LHP), which led to partnerships with educational technology companies and the launching of virtual e-learning platforms.\n\nThese platforms include SchoolGate (for primary school students), Mobile Classroom, WAEC E-learning toolkit and Unity Schools virtual learning platforms.\n\nThe Ministry, on its website, also linked to other educational resources from Khan Academy, Seesaw, National Open University, UNESCO School Meets Learner Approach, Teacher Development Programme, British Council, and others.\n\nState Governments, too, adopted several initiatives. The Lagos State government, for example, partnered with First Bank of Nigeria to equip students with e-learning solutions and low-end devices preloaded with a government-accredited curriculum and designed to work offline.\n\nAlso, many states turned to broadcasting lessons on radio and television. These lessons encompassed content on core primary and secondary school subjects.\n\nBut what was the impact of these interventions? Were they able to meet the learning needs of students or mitigate the number of dropouts when schools eventually reopened, considering Nigeria has one of the largest numbers of out-of-school-children in the world?\n\nA Federal Ministry of Education spokesman Ben Bem Goong suggested that it was hardly the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to ensure active participation in digital learning.\n\n\u201cHaving access to online facilities is basically an individual responsibility,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t buy a phone and give it to anybody. I don\u2019t think the Ministry will buy phones and laptops (for students) to access online materials. We haven\u2019t gotten to that level.\u201d\n\nOne vision of the Ministry of Education is \u201cto provide universal and equal access to quality basic and secondary education that will ensure self-reliance, preparedness for further education, good citizenship and effective participation in democratic governance.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the Ministry was worried about the inability of many students, especially those attending public, rural schools, to access digital learning, including resources provided by the government, Mr Goong said the government cannot be expected to do everything.\n\n\u201cThe question you are asking me is not within the (purview) of the Federal Ministry of Education to answer, in the sense that providing Internet facilities is not just a function of what the Ministry of Education does alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of providing electricity \u2013 which is the key driver to rolling out online materials \u2013 it\u2019s not within our responsibility to do. This cuts across sectors. So when a student is unable to access online materials that are driven by electricity or wireless signals, it is not entirely a responsibility of the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cIt is a responsibility that cuts across Ministries, one that also has to do with the family. There is no way government can do all of that alone; if government has built schools, government has engaged teachers, it\u2019s paying them, maintaining the schools, I think some other stakeholders should also take that responsibility, particularly those that value education; they should be able to say how do I provide laptops and batteries for my children to learn. When you begin to put everything on the head of government, believe you me, even the best critics of governance will not like to be in government after one week.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for another pandemic-like school closure, Mr Goong said the Federal Ministry of Education was seeking to partner with the Nigeria Television Authority and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria to develop lessons in key areas for broadcast, especially for students in exit classes.\n\nThe importance of digital tools\n\nSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna. He was excited to be starting his fellowship with Teach for Nigeria, a program which recruits talented future leaders and sends them to teach at schools in low-income communities.\n\nHe remembers being introduced to teachers who were invigilating a primary six examination. When he asked them how the students were doing, they appeared to mock the pupils. \u201cThese ones? They don\u2019t know anything,\u201d one of the teachers said, according to Onyeledo. \u201cIn fact, they can\u2019t even read the questions on the board. We just wrote it down in English language but we have to read it out in Hausa before they will be able to attempt it.\u201d\n\nFor most of the next two years, Onyeledo, a graduate of Geology from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, worked hard to teach a class of kids how to read.\n\n\u201cIf a child goes from primary one to primary six and still can\u2019t read,\u201d Onyeledo said, \u201c I think the school system has wasted six years of that child\u2019s life. Because a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy. Just the ability to read, to communicate in the English language.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic-induced school closures cut short Onyeledo\u2019s time with the kids.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was close to devastating, mainly because of the kids in my class,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cI had been working with them closely, trying to get them to learn to read, basically. I was teaching primary two. I started with them in primary one. That was then the pandemic happened. When schools closed, it was devastating because I knew how far we had gone. If I\u2019m not with them, they might just slide back.\u201d\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t really be with them because most of the parents of the kids in his class didn\u2019t have smartphones. The only channel of communication was through voice calls, which he said were not effective enough and couldn\u2019t really scale. There were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that level, these children need hands-on-learning, they need guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen lockdown measures were eased, he tried to visit some of his students at home and share resources with their guidance, while observing Covid protocols. But he would always wish that his students had access to technology.\n\n\u201cWith tech, we would have held online classes on Zoom, easily created a classroom, a group for all the parents and kids,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cAnd sometimes send voice notes. For those who are visual learners too, we could send some resources, including videos. It would make your teaching very effective. With technology, it would have been a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nMaryam Onubaye, 27, was another Teach for Nigeria fellow in Kaduna who lost major contact with her pupils after schools closed. But she wouldn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about ways to get them learning,\u201d she said \u201cSome of their parents have Whatsapp-enabled phones. So I went to their houses \u2013 the community where my school was \u2013 Tudun Wada \u2013 you can have like five families in one area and ten kids. I went to their houses and made lesson videos on the subjects I teach and every week I send them to their phones. I give exercises at the end of the videos that they can do. And I explain to parents how they can guide them and make sure they actually do the exercises. And they take a picture and send it back to me. We did that every week.\n\n\u201cThe ones who do not have Whatsapp-enabled phones, I had to do weekly exercises with them. Every weekend, I\u2019ll go and teach them a little, come back and follow up.\u201d\n\nHer enthusiasm and creativity and hard work made some impact, but Onubaye recognised the limitations. More \u201cdigital tools would have made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for that to happen, there are so many things that need to happen. The kids have to have access to the internet, power, a tablet, a phone or a computer.\u201d For now, they do not.\n\n\u2018A lot of work to do\u2019\n\nIn March, internet penetration in Nigeria stood at 41 percent, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission. And coverage is mostly limited to urban cities such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano. But almost half of all Nigerians still live in rural communities, according to data from the World Bank. In 2020, the Federal Government launched a new national broadband plan which, by 2025, is expected to ensure all tertiary education institutions are within \u201c5km of fibre manhole or with a fixed connection\u201d to the Internet. Under the plan 50 per cent of secondary schools and 25 percent are expected to be covered by 2025. Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, which \u201cworks to connect underserved young Africans with digital opportunities\u201d, said the government\u2019s plan \u201cis very conservative\u201d and \u201cmay not even be achieved if the government continues to introduce contradictory policies.\u201d\n\nAnother obvious challenge is power supply. As of 2018, according to World Bank data, only 56.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population have access to electricity. And as tariffs continue to rise, the poor and their children may find it harder to afford the glow from light bulbs.\n\nThe national situation is exacerbated by rising insecurity. While the number of out-of-school-children in Nigeria has dropped to 6.9 million from 10.1 million, with the help of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) programme in Nigeria, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has noted that \u201cmore and more children are joining the queue.\u201d Between December and March 2020, over 600 students were kidnapped from schools across the country. \u201cStudent kidnappings threaten collapse of Nigerian education system,\u201d two scholars warned in April.\n\n\u201cGovernment has a lot of work to do,\u201d Zam Daniel, a teacher in Abuja, said. \u201cIn the education sector, we are about 50 years behind developed countries.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, Nigeria must work to democratise digital education.\n\n\u201cIf it is our right to be educated and the web is now the biggest source of information,\u201d Adetola Omolade, a teacher at Greensprings School in Lagos, said.\n\n\u201cthen I think access to the internet is a basic human right.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams.\nThe importance of digital toolsSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna.\nBecause a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy.\nThere were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students.",

          "text": "More than a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died of Covid-19 in Indonesia, according to a medical association, as the Southeast Asian country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers and highly infectious new virus strains.\n\nInfections have surged in the nation of 270 million people in the past week, with more than 2.05 million cases reported as of Saturday, as hospital occupancy rates soared to more than 75 percent in Jakarta and other hard-hit areas.\n\nNearly 1,000 Indonesian health workers have died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country\u2019s medical association confirming on Friday that 401 doctors were among the victims \u2013 14 of whom were fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still updating the data and confirming whether the other cases had been vaccinated or not,\u201d the association\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation head Mohammad Adib Khumaidi told journalists.\n\nThe rise of severe cases in inoculated medical workers has raised questions about the China-produced Sinovac jab, which Indonesia is heavily relying on to vaccinate more than 180 million people by early next year.\n\nThis month, more than 300 vaccinated doctors and healthcare workers in Central Java were found to have been infected with COVID-19, with about a dozen hospitalised.\n\nThe country is also grappling with new virus strains, including the highly infectious Delta variant first identified in India.\n\nIn the capital, Jakarta, the surge in cases have forced hospitals to set up emergency tents, according to Detik news website, which quoted provincial government officials.\n\nIn Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province, Dr Inke Nadia D Lubis, member of the COVID task force in the area, reported that in the last six months as many as 1,800 children have been infected with the virus, including 14 who have died.\n\nMore than a third of the cases reported were elementary school-age students, while a quarter were high school-age students, Inke was quoted by Detik as saying.\n\nOn Friday, President Joko Widodo said that the country is facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d, vowing to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d while urging his countrymen to cooperate in the government\u2019s response.\n\nClinical symptoms suggest that strain is responsible for a surge in cases in West Java, the medical association\u2019s spokesperson for the province, Eka Mulyana, said.\n\n\u201cIn West Java, bed occupancy rates have exceeded 90 percent. Some hospitals\u2019 rates are even more than 100 percent,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, our health system is close to collapse.\u201d\n\nDozens of communities in Central Java\u2019s Kudus regency were put under lockdown after the Delta variant was detected in local testing samples, causing a sudden spike in virus cases.\n\nA patient rests on the floor at a temporary tent outside the emergency ward of a government hospital, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Bekasi, on the outskirts of Jakarta on Friday [Willy Kurniawan/Reuters]\n\nThe surge has been partly blamed on millions travelling from that region across the Muslim-majority nation at the end of Ramadan last month, despite an official ban on the annual migration.\n\nThe Indonesian medical association\u2019s Kudus representative, Ahmad Ipul Syaifuddin, has said the mass movement of people had made it next to impossible to determine where the surge began.\n\n\u201cWe have no clue on how to trace and find the first spreader of the Delta cases because the sampling test result came out around three weeks after the mass exodus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy sample was among the tested sampling for the Delta variant. I have already recovered and (have) tested negative now, but I still have a cough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Jakarta Post reported that among those who were recently infected with the coronavirus is an unnamed Indonesian official, who was travelling to Italy for an international conference.\n\nThe official is under quarantine for 10 days after testing positive upon arrival at the Sicilian port city of Catania, where officials from around the world were convening for a series of G20 ministerial meetings.",

          "text": "The widow of John McAfee, the British-American tycoon who died in a Spanish prison this week while awaiting extradition to the United States, on Friday demanded a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of his death, saying her husband did not appear suicidal when they last spoke.\n\nAuthorities in Spain are conducting an autopsy on McAfee\u2019s body but have said that everything at the scene in his cell indicated that the 75-year-old killed himself.\n\nAn official source familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that a suicide note had been found in McAfee\u2019s pocket. The source, who was not authorized to speak about an ongoing judicial inquiry, refused to comment on the content of the note.\n\nMcAfee\u2019s Spanish lawyer, Javier Villalba, said that the family had not been informed by authorities about the note.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur\u2019s death on Wednesday, McAfee\u2019s widow Janice McAfee said she wanted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d to provide \u201canswers about this was able to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis last words to me were \u2018I love you and I will call you in the evening,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old told reporters outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona where she recovered her late husband\u2019s belongings. She said they spoke earlier on the day he was found dead.\n\n\u201cThose words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn McAfee was arrested at the Barcelona airport in October last year on a warrant issued by prosecutors in Tennessee who were seeking up to three decades of imprisonment for allegedly evading more than $4 million in taxes.\n\nThe day before he was found dead, Spain\u2019s National Court had announced that it was agreeing to his extradition to the U.S. but the decision was not final.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,\u201d Janice McAfee told reporters. \u201cI blame the U.S. authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.\u201d\n\nThe National Court judge said John McAfee had provided no evidence to back his allegations that he was being politically persecuted. \u201cOn the contrary, according to his own testimony, he took part in primaries of a certain party to defend his convictions with a result little favorable to him,\u201d the judge wrote in the ruling seen by AP.\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, the U.S. State Department confirmed for the first time the tycoon\u2019s death, offering the family condolences. It said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring local authorities\u2019 investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate assistance to the family. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment.\u201d\n\nResults of McAfee\u2019s autopsy could take \u201cdays or weeks,\u201d authorities have said.\n\nThe couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee had several children from previous relationships, Janice McAfee said.\n\nThe entrepreneur had not been connected with the companies that took over the antivirus software he built after he sold his shares in the 1990s. That early success had made McAfee rich and followed him in his troubled biography.\n\nIn 2012, he was sought for questioning in connection with the murder of his neighbor in Belize, but was never charged with a crime. The controversy didn\u2019t stop him from making long-shot runs for the U.S. presidency starting in 2016.\n\nBut it was his more recent tax problems that kept him away from the U.S., the country where the British-born entrepreneur was raised and had built his early success.\n\nThe Tennessee prosecutors\u2019 indictments from 2020 showed that the tycoon allegedly failed to declare income made by promoting cryptocurrencies, attending speaking engagements and selling the rights for a documentary on his eventful life.\n\n\u201cEven though he was born in England, America was his home,\u201d Janice McAfee said. \u201cHe came there when he was a child. He had his first girlfriend there, his first case, you know, his first job. He made his first millions there and he wanted to be there. But, you know, politics just wouldn\u2019t allow for that to happen.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee\u2019s social media postings indicated that he had chosen a northeastern Spanish coastal resort town as his base in Europe at least since late 2019.\n\n\u201cAll John wanted to do was spend his remaining years fishing and drinking,\u201d his widow said on Friday. \u201cHe had hope that things would work out. We knew that there would be an uphill battle to continue to fight this situation. But he\u2019s a fighter \u2026 And anybody that knows John, that knows him even a little bit, knows that about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just so loving. He had a big heart and he just loved people and he just wanted to have peace in his life,\u201d Janice McAfee added. \u201cMy prayers are that his soul has found the peace in death that he could not find in life.\u201d",
