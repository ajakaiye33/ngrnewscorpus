          "text": "Some gunmen suspected to be herdsmen were said to have invaded Apiye Jim Village in the Atyap Chiefdom of Zango-Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing 12 persons.\n\nThe latest attack, a source said, happened on Sunday evening during a downpour.\n\nAlthough there was no official confirmation from either the state government or the state Police command, the spokesperson of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, SOKAPU, Mr. Luka Binniyat, confirmed the attack to our correspondent on Monday.\n\nBinniyat said, \u201cIt is very true. They also killed another man in Atakshusho village about three kilometers from the initial scene of crime as they were retreating to make an escape.\n\n\u201cRecall that an ECWA Reverend was murdered just on the outskirts of Zangon Kataf town, which our people have always complained of harbouring killers, time and again.\n\n\u201cThat will bring to 13 those killed in Atyap land, Zangon Kataf LGA. in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cAs usual, no one has been apprehended. We are awaiting details of the killings, after which we shall issue a statement later today.\u201d\n\nThe latest attack was coming in less than 24 hours after the murder of an ECWA Church Pastor, Rev. Silas Yakubu Ali, in the same council on Saturday.\n\nThe cleric was said to have been hacked to death by his assailants.\n\nThe attackers on Sunday evening were said to have targeted specific houses during the attack.\n\nThe source, who craved anonymity, said on Monday that many of the villagers were still missing after the attack, but noted that, so far, no fewer than 11 lifeless bodies had been counted following the attack.\n\nAccording to him, the attackers came in large numbers and perpetrated the act in a jiffy and immediately escaped from the village.\n\nHe added, \u201cThey (attackers) came while it was raining and divided themselves into groups. They targeted specific houses and when done, left immediately.\n\n\u201cScores of the villagers are missing at the moment. It\u2019s impossible for one to ascertain the number of those injured and even those killed; but so far, l have counted and found 11 dead persons in different locations this morning (Monday).\n\n\u201cThe Atyapland is left to carry its cross in the hands of the attackers who moved from one village to the another killing, maiming, burning houses and destroying crops in farmlands at will, without being arrested.\n\n\u201cWith the various attacks and the occupation of our forest where we cultivate farms for our survival this year, we are busy trying to save ourselves from the attackers as people are not thinking of going to farm.\u201d",

          "text": "Says we can\u2019t tolerate further massacres of our indigenous people\n\nUrges FG to urgently return displaced people to their ancestral land\n\nCalls for establishment of Middle Belt Development Commission\n\nHails Gov Wike for consistent struggle for the Rule of Law\n\nBy Chris Ochayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nCiting what it described as lackadaisical attitude and abandonment by the Federal Government, the National Executive Committee, NEC, of the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has vowed to respond to any further attacks on communities in the region.\n\nThe Forum, rising from the NEC meeting, which ended weekend in Akwanga, Nasarawa state, also resolved that an attack on any of our communities is henceforth, considered as an attack on all Communities in the Middle Belt region with the attendant responses and consequences.\n\nAccording to the communiqu\u00e9 signed by its National President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, the NEC, noted that, \u201dAgainst the backdrop of ethnic cleansing being waged by Fulani terrorists in our communities, including the supplanting of our people, NEC resolves that people of the Middle Belt region should rise up and defend themselves in the face of governments abandoning their Constitutional responsibility of defending them or seeming complicity.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 obtained by vanguard on Sunday in Abuja reads, \u201dAfter extensive deliberations by the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, National Executive Committee, NEC, on a wide range of issues affecting the Middle Belt Region and the nation at large, it was resolved as follows:\n\n\u201dThat, Nigeria has been plunged into a critical situation of insecurity occasioned by the activities of Boko Haram terrorists, armed Fulani militia, kidnappers/bandits and other related criminal elements.\n\n\u201dThis spate of insecurity has pushed the nation to the precipice. NEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to arrest the situation and save the nation from another civil war.\n\n\u201dThat, the incessant invasions by Fulani militia on several communities across the Middle Belt Region in particular, and other parts of the country in general, have assumed genocidal/ethnic cleansing scale.\n\n\u201dThese attacks have left in their wake mind-boggling massacres and devastations in our communities and displacement of indigenous Peoples to various Internally Displaced Person,IDP, camps.\n\n\u201dNEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to return displaced communities to their ancestral lands, given the fact that territory can no longer be acquired in the 21st century by the use of force. NEC also calls on the government to identify all IDPs in the Middle Belt Region and provide relief materials for them.\n\n\u201dNEC calls on the Federal Government to identify, apprehend and bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against humanity to justice so as to serve as a deterrent to others. Consequently, NEC calls on the government to set up an agency to be called the Middle Belt Development Commission, MBDC, to serve as an intervention agency in addressing the challenges caused by the activities of these terrorists.\n\n\u201dThat many schools and places of worship in the Middle Belt Region have remained closed due to the criminal activities of these Fulani kidnappers and bandits. NEC regrets that many school children and other hapless citizens are still languishing in the dens of kidnappers. NEC further appeals to the government to take urgent steps to rescue those in captivity.\n\n\u201dThe MBF insists that the Federal Government must come clean and yield to the demand by the Nigerian public to unveil the identities of the sponsors of Boko Haram, especially the 400 Bureau de change operators as identified by the UAE authorities.\n\n\u201dNEC finds worrisome, given the report by the UN that the Federal government is secretly engaged in negotiations tagged \u2018Sulhu\u2019 with Boko Haram terrorists through which the Federal Government is allegedly offering monetary rewards to insurgents and other criminals.\n\n\u201dConsequently, NEC is totally opposed to this project and also opposed to any form of amnesty to insurgents and other terror groups who have their hands dripping with blood. NEC is also vehemently opposed to any planned recruitment of these so called repentant terrorists into the national security architecture.\n\n\u201dSince democracy is about the wishes and aspirations of the people, NEC calls on both the National Assembly and the Presidency to reconsider their position on electronic transmission of election results and yield to the wishes of the Nigerian people who are demanding 100 percent implementation of electronic transmission of electoral results in order to ensure credibility and transparency in the electoral process.\n\n\u201dNEC commends the Southern Governors and some Governors in the Middle Belt and their State Assemblies for their courage in passing Anti-Open Grazing Laws in their states.\n\n\u201dNEC condemns in very strong terms the call by Miyetti Allah on its members not to obey the Anti-Open Grazing Laws duly passed in their states, threatening to make states that attempt to implement such a law ungovernable.\n\n\u201dNEC views this as a clear threat to National Security, and demands that Miyetti Allah officials should be arrested, investigated and prosecuted under our anti-terrorism laws.\n\n\u201dNEC reviews the zoning arrangement as it relates to the Presidency in Nigeria and considers the current arrangement of power rotation between the North and the South as unfair as it has failed to recognize the Middle Belt geopolitical block.\n\n\u201dNEC, therefore, calls on the political actors in Nigeria particularly political parties to henceforth reflect the zoning arrangements for power to rotate between North, South and the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201dNEC acknowledges and commends Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state for his resilient stance in the defence of the rights of the Benue people and for his courage and foresight in making the anti-open grazing law even in the face of threats by Miyetti Allah and those other forces that seek to Fulanise and enslave the Benue people and the rest of the Middle Belt. It is for his foresight that today, the entire Southern Nigeria has adopted his position based on the validity of his position.\n\n\u201dBy the same token, NEC commends Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for his consistent struggle for the Rule of Law and true Federalism, particularly the recent judgment of the Federal High Court on the Value Added Tax, VAT, which has opened the door for the commencement of the struggle for Restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of ethnic cleansing being waged by Fulani terrorists in our Communities, including the supplanting of our people, NEC resolves that people of the Middle Belt Region should rise up and defend themselves in the face of governments abandoning their Constitutional responsibility of defending them or seeming complicity.\n\n\u201dFurthermore, NEC resolves that an attack on any of our communities is henceforth, considered as an attack on all communities in the Middle Belt Region with the attendant responses and consequences.\n\n\u201dAfter considering the scorecard of the National Working Committee, NWC, of the MBF led by Dr Pogu Bitrus, NEC overwhelmingly passed a vote of confidence on the leadership of the Forum.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

These are people who lack the professionalism to do such businesses, dollars are always made available to those individuals just on a call. While Mr President is working his sleeves out in the fight against corruption, some supposed lieutenant such as Mr Emiefele are busy aiding it and thereby playing down on Mr President\u2019s effort.\u201d\n\nInsecurity: Nigeria\u2019s current economy can\u2019t grow \u2013 CBN\u2019s Emefiele\n\nIt lamented that the CBN has failed to submit its audited account to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) for scrutiny, since 2010 till date, adding that this was confirmed by the Chairman, House Committee on Finance, Rt. Hon. James Faleke.\n\nRecall that Faleke in an interactive session with the Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Edward Adamu, said the apex bank had failed to remit about N800 billion to the Federal Government.\n\nIt explained that it does not speak well of the apex bank that is supposed to be championing proper scrutiny for financial dealings and transactions especially within the finance sector.\n\nIt further explained that one of the biggest fraud under Mr Emiefele\u2019s leadership is the CBN COVID-19 loan, pointing out that the governor of the CBN through this loan has seen an opportunity to siphon money in other to pursue his alleged greedy presidential ambition that holds nothing good for the country.\n\nThe statement expressed confidence that the hope of all Nigerians is that the E-Naira wallet initiative that is to kick off on the 1st of October, 2021 would actually meet the aim of the initiative and fulfill the expectations of many Nigerians and not \u201ca criminal medium\u201d to funnel out funds to support the selfish presidential ambition of Mr. Emiefele.\n\nIt observed that a year ago, on July 24, 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) unveiled series of guidelines for the non-interest financial interventions under its non interest loan scheme initiative for Agric-Business Small & Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme(AGSMEIS), Micro Small & Medium Enterprise Development Fund(MSMEDF), the Accelerated Agricultural Development Fund(AADF), adding that these scheme attracts a lot of interest from several Nigerians, as millions applied for the scheme following every due procedure, but over a year and nothing has been said or heard about this scheme from the CBN.\n\nIt added that the scheme has been abandoned and is largely due to Emefiele\u2019s now divided attention as what is uppermost in his thought is his Presidential ambition, stressing that the CBN Governor should resign and face his ambition squarely, Nigeria and Nigerians cannot be allowed to suffer just for the interest of one man.\n\nThe statement noted that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) threatened a fresh strike as a result of impasse implementations of agreed terms with the Federal Government, saying that again, the CBN is in the centre of all the commotion.\n\nIt said that the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Mr Chris Ngige pointed accusing fingers at the CBN under the leadership of Mr Emefiele as not been able to come up with her audited report that will enable the Federal Government to implement and execute on projects meant to foster progress on all front, lamenting Mr Emefiele\u2019s nonchalant attitude is playing a very big role in holding the educational system to ransom.\n\nThe group called on Mr Emefiele to resign his position as the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) or face their wrath as they are ready to occupy the premises of his office en masse in a few days from now and stay there permanently until he resigns.\n\nCBN interventions in agriculture for all Nigerians \u2013 Emefiele",

A tour of the facility is also ongoing.\n\n\u201cA Crisis Response Centre has been activated and a Special Taskforce mobilised to recapture escaped inmates whilst an Inter-Agency Security Task Force is already on the trail of the gunmen who attacked the facility.The public is advised to stay calm as the situation is under control.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, assures the citizenry that Nigeria\u2019s security forces will find the attackers and bring them to justice. We shall leave no stone unturned to bring them back to custody. We are also putting INTERPOL on notice with their details, in case any of them attempts fleeing outside our shores.\n\n\u201cWe urge the people, especially the communities around the custodial facility, to be vigilant and report any strange and suspicious persons or activities to the nearest law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cTo the fleeing inmates, escaping from lawful custody is a serious criminal offence. Law enforcement agencies and citizens are lawfully empowered to use all necessary means to arrest and bring you to justice.\n\n\u201cYou should therefore know what you are up against. You will however be eligible for mitigation if you wilfully surrender yourselves at the nearest law enforcement office.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Correctional Service shall not be cowed by elements seeking to compromise the security of our nation; we shall deal with this situation with absolute resolve.\u201d",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s largest telecom company MTN Group is reportedly in talks with potential international buyers for its wireless business in Afghanistan per Bloomberg.\n\nThis is part of the company\u2019s plans to accelerate its exit from the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe South Africa headquartered company is currently the market leader in Afghanistan with a 40% share and is in discussions with several parties in ongoing negotiations to sell its Afghanistan arm. A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets. The carrier earlier this year abandoned its operation in Syria, citing regulatory demands that made operating there untenable; last month the carrier stated that it was still evaluating options in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe sale of its Afghanistan unit is crucial to MTN as it plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa. The proceeds will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nUnlike MTN, the other telecom companies operating in Afghanistan, which also includes state-owned Afghan Wireless and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates, have reassured customers and investors that services will keep running following the collapse of the US-backed government last month while trying to secure the safety of their employees in the country.\n\nMTN currently serves over six million customers in Afghanistan, its planned exit could serve as an opportunity for other Afghanistan telecom players to expand their market share, while MTN does the same in Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

The attack is believed to have occurred in the late hours of Sunday.\n\n\u201cDuring the attack, security officers on duty which comprised of 15 Soldiers, 10 Police Officers and 10 armed guards of the NCoS on duty fought gallantly to repel the attack.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, two officers of the Correctional Service are yet to be accounted for while one soldier and a policeman lost their lives during the attack,\u201d he said.\n\nRead the full statement by Mr Fasure below.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has been briefed by the Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS), Haliru Nababa, on the unfortunate attack on Kabba Medium Security Custodial Centre, in Kabba, Kogi State, by yet to be identified gunmen.\n\nDuring the attack, security officers on duty which comprised of 15 Soldiers, 10 Police Officers and 10 armed guards of the NCoS on duty fought gallantly to repel the attack. Regrettably, two officers of the Correctional Service are yet to be accounted for while one soldier and a policeman lost their lives during the attack.\n\nThe Kabba Custodial facility had 294 inmates as at the time of the attack, many of whom escaped after the gunmen used explosives to destroy three sides of the perimeter fence. However, there remains 28 inmates who didn\u2019t escape. Some have also voluntarily returned to the facility as at this morning.\n\nThe Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, is currently monitoring the situation. A tour of the facility is also ongoing.\n\nA Crisis Response Centre has been activated and a Special Taskforce mobilized to recapture escaped inmates whilst an Inter-Agency Security Task Force is already on the trail of the gunmen who attacked the facility. The public is advised to stay calm as the situation is under control.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, assures the citizenry that Nigeria\u2019s security forces will find the attackers and bring them to justice. We shall leave no stone unturned to bring them back to custody. We are also putting INTERPOL on notice with their details, in case any of them attempts fleeing outside our shores.\n\nWe urge the people, especially the communities around the custodial facility, to be vigilant and report any strange and suspicious persons or activities to the nearest law enforcement agency.\n\nTo the fleeing inmates, escaping from lawful custody is a serious criminal offence. Law enforcement agencies and citizens are lawfully empowered to use all necessary means to arrest and bring you to justice. You should therefore know what you are up against. You will however be eligible for mitigation if you wilfully surrender yourselves at the nearest law enforcement office.\n\nThe Nigeria Correctional Service shall not be cowed by elements seeking to compromise the security of our nation; we shall deal with this situation with absolute resolve.\n\nFurther updates will be provided after the end of the preliminary assessment.\n\nSigned\n\nSola Fasure\n\nMedia Adviser to the Minister of Interior\n\nFor Honourable Minister of Interior",

          "text": "Black marketers in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast are making brisk business selling premium motor spirit (PMS), popularly called fuel, for as much as N500 and N600 per litre as scarcity of the product persist in the zone.\n\nThis even as few independent marketers that have products sell between N220 to N250 per litre.\n\nSoutheast residents woke up last week to notice that fuel stations were not selling products, while few that sold had raised their prices to between N200 and N250 per litre, a situation that has persisted for about a week.\n\nThe scarcity, Business Hallmark learnt, was caused by an industrial action by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN). The association, since last week, shut down the supply of petroleum products in the zone over an issue between one of its members and the Imo State government.\n\nThis started when the Imo State Government, under former governor, Rochas Okorocha, in it\u2019s urban renewal and expansion programme, embarked on the demolition of some properties to allow for expansion of major roads. One of the properties destroyed was a fuel station and the proprietor approached the courts claiming damages against the Imo State Government.\n\nThe fuel marketer is reported to have won the case he instituted with N100 million compensation ordered to be paid to him. He awaited the ordered compensation from Government which was not forthcoming, Sam Hart, aide to Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu narrated on Sunday.\n\nIPMAN Imo State, consequently intervened on behalf of their Member and sought to have Government resolve the issue. Events were not to their satisfaction and in solidarity with their Member, they decided to stop selling fuel in Imo State.\n\nSubsequently, tanker drivers who supply fuel to Imo State and neighbouring areas also joined in the solidarity protest leading to tankers queuing up in border communities in Imo State awaiting resolution of the impasse before they can resume supplies.\n\nSecurity Agencies waded in and appealed to the Marketers to call off the protest as tankers, laden with fuel, massed at entrances to the State, were a Security risk. The security Chiefs promised to meet with the Governor to have the issue resolved.\n\nIn the midst of the impasse, the Imo State Government was reported to have directed it\u2019s citizens to go to neighbouring states to buy fuel until the Marketers in Imo State have a rethink.\n\nThis directive, according to Mr. Hart, did not go down well with the Members of IPMAN in neighbouring states who in-turn, suspended sale of petroleum products in solidarity with their brethren in Imo State.\n\nThe NNPC Deport supplying the South East have equally stopped supplies to avert crisis.",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Hope rises for Andy Uba as APC plots end to APGAs 16-year rule",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLong before primary elections were held, the Anambra State governorship election \u2013 now due in less than two months, precisely on November 6 \u2013 had looked certain to be, ultimately, a two-horse race between the state\u2019s ruling party, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), given the unpopularity of the country\u2019s ruling party, the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state and the unlikelihood of the Young Progressive Party (YPP), a relatively small party, causing an upset.\n\nBut weeks before the state electorate head to the polls, permutations have changed. The APC and its candidate, Emmanuel Nnamdi Uba, popularly known as Andy Uba, are looking poised to cause an upset, as a combination of factors, including crisis in APGA, possible voter apathy and likely deployment of federal might are catalysizing in their favour.\n\nThe announcement last week, for instance, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), that it would use its zonal office in Owerri, Imo State capital, to distribute non-sensitive materials for the governorship election, has jolted many, who allege it is part of the ruling party\u2019s plot to rig the polls.\n\nINEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, had said during the commissions quarterly meeting with media executives in Abuja, on Wednesday, that the decision was as a result of recent vandalisation and attacks on the commissions facilities in Anambra by some unknown gunmen suspected to be sympathetic to the agitation for Biafra by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe INEC chairman\u2019s reasons, however, failed to convince other stakeholders in the election, given that Imo is not the closest state to Anambra in terms of geography; is an APC state and the state\u2019s governor, Hope Uzodinma is the Chairman of the party\u2019s Campaign Council for the election.\n\nIncumbent governor, Chief Willie Obiano has since rejected the idea, noting that his party, APGA and the people of the state, will reject the decision to use INEC facility in Owerri for the stated purpose.\n\n\u201cBeyond the issue of storing INEC materials meant for Anambra election in APC state, Imo, there was a letter we sent out expressing our rejection of Owerri or any other APC state involving actively in the Anambra election,\u201d Obiano\u2019s special adviser on political matters argued in a chat with newsmen in Awka last week.\n\n\u201cWhat informed the letter was the rumour that some ad-hoc staff and returning officers for the Anambra election are being recruited from the Imo State University. In the next few days, all the political parties taking part in the Anambra election, except APC, will sign the communiqu\u00e9, which will be forwarded to INEC.\n\n\u201cThe letter will state our decision that we, as people and all the political parties, except APC, will reject any ad-hoc staff recruited from Imo State, in particular, and generally, from any APC state.\n\n\u201cFor us, this issue of keeping the sensitive material in INEC office in Imo is totally unacceptable because, it does not conform with our earlier desire to write that we would have nothing to do with the Imo State structures, Imo personnel, and indeed, any APC state, for the purposes of election in Anambra. There are other states closer to Anambra, including Delta and Enugu; if what theyre claiming is correct.\n\n\u201cLet me also tell INEC that weve had this kind of situation in the past, where sensitive materials were kept in the central bank in that state. It has happened before in Enugu State. Those sensitive materials were kept in the CBN, and were indeed, distributed from the central bank in Enugu.\n\n\u201cWe have a central bank in Anambra State. If the reason they are giving is correct, these materials could be kept at the central bank here, and be distributed from there.\n\n\u201cIt is also curious to note that for more than four months, after INEC office was destroyed in Anambra, this matter is coming to the public domain for the first time. It is mischievous; it doesnt make sense! What we heard from INEC was that non sensitive materials were destroyed.\n\n\u201cWe were never told that sensitive structure that will sustain the process of the election was ever affected by that attack. We reject it, and will also make sure that we resist it.\n\n\u201cUnless INEC do not intend to conduct election on the 6th of November, the people of Anambra State will reject any move to rig the election. Nobody; I mean nobody, should ever play games with Anambra State. INEC, by that announcement, do not really want to keep it at the INEC office.\n\n\u201cThey actually want to operate from Governor Uzodimmas bedroom. sThey want to recruit returning officers from Imo, and also write the original result sheets in the state. So, if they succeed in operating from Imo, coming to Anambra to conduct election will be mere formality.\u201d\n\nThe YPP, whose candidate, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, is seeking to be the first Nnewi governor of the state, also strongly opposed the idea of using Imo to store materials for the election.\n\nYPPs National Publicity Secretary, Egbeola Martins, who conveyed the party\u2019s displeasure with the idea in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, described the plan as ill-conceived and illogical proposition capable of overheating the polity, considering the mutual suspicion already existing among the political parties.\n\n\u201cOur inability to have risen above petty considerations as a nation has marred perception to be everything in this part of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be foolhardy for anyone, including INEC, to think that keeping electoral materials, whether sensitive or non-sensitive, in an APC-controlled state of Imo is right.\n\n\u201cWe call upon INEC to rescind every plan to store election materials in Imo, as events have shown that it is not any better than Anambra or any other state within the region,\u201d he said.\n\nMartins argued that if proximity was one of the considerations for the storage of election materials in Imo, Delta and Enugu states rank as better alternatives for proximity sake, insisting that the call for this logistical rejigging should not be a herculean task, as anything contrary might suggest that INEC would be compromised.\n\nThe opposition has so far failed to dissuade INEC from proceeding with the plan to use Imo State, even the continued insistence by the IPOB on boycott of the election is likely to cause voter apathy, which observers say, is likely to work to APC\u2019s advantage.\n\n\u201cIf IPOB continues with its \u2018no election\u2019 rhetoric in Anambra, Andy Uba of the APC will become governor,\u201d noted activist Henry Shield Nwazuluahu, @henryshield\n\nMany voters in the state, however, insist they wouldn\u2019t touch Uba, whose person, not less his family, elicit controversy, with a long spoon. Attempts have also been made to use negative media campaign against him, such as the allegations of him planning to create grazing reserves for Fulani in Anambra.\n\nBut even his fiercest critics now concede that he is no longer that candidate with at best an outside chance of winning, but a mainstream contender capable of snatching up victory.\n\n\u201cThe way things stand now, APC and its candidate, Andy Uba are becoming serious contenders in the Anambra election,\u201d said Mr. Oliver Nwafor, a political observer and business owner in Awka, the state capital.\n\n\u201cThis is largely on account of the crisis in APGA. All the people that APGA disqualified are joining APC with their supporters, which might be the momentum the party needs to be able to manipulate the election in its favour.\u201d\n\nAPGA, which has been in charge of Anambra for 15 years, since 2006 when Peter Obi reclaimed his mandate through the court, had looked a clear cut favourite to win the election on November 6, especially with former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Professor Charles Soludo, a popular figure in the state and indeed Nigeria, with proven administrative capacity, emerging as its candidate.\n\nSoludo\u2019s emergence as the candidate was never hardly in doubt, given his pedigree and the close relationship he has with the incumbent governor, Chief Obiano. But the governor\u2019s wife is said to be staunchly opposed to the idea of Soludo succeeding her husband, which has created gulf within the ruling family.\n\nYet, even the primary election that eventually produced the ex CBN governor in June was largely bungled, with a number of aspirants, including filmmaker, Ifeanyi Odera Ozoka; member representing Nnewi North constituency at the State House of Assembly, Nonso Okafor; special envoy to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Sullivan Akachukwu Nwankpo; member of the Federal House of Representatives representing Aguata Federal Constituency, Michael Chukwuma Umeoji, and Assembly member representing Aguata 1, Carter Nnamdi Dike Umeoduagu, disqualified for some flimsy reasons, ranging from not having spent up to 18 months in the party, defiance and insubordination to party authority and supremacy; not registering as a voter in the state.\n\nThe disqualification has created disaffection in the party, one that has simply refused to go away. Nwankpo has since joined the African Democratic Congress (ADC) and picked up its ticket, and a fortnight ago, six members of the state assembly, including Umeoduagu, Okafor, Lawrence Ezeudu of Dunukofia, Arthur Chiekwu representing Idemmili North and Edward Ibuzo representing Onitsha North 2, defected to the APC with their supporters, in a move that vastly depleted APGA\u2019s ranks.\n\nMore disaffected members of the state\u2019s ruling party are still expected to pitch tent with APC, and the party is upbeat about the possibility of taking over Anambra with Senator Uba.\n\n\u201cI would say that Andy Uba has a very bright chance of winning the election,\u201d said Comrade Izuchukwu Udoka Ezeigwe, APC youth leader in Agulu. \u201cFirst of all, if you understand how Nigerian politics work, you will know that most times the party that controls power at the centre normally bring federal might to bear during elections in the states.\n\n\u201cAgain, Andy Uba is an experienced politician who knows the nitty-gritty of politics in Nigeria. So I\u2019ll say he has a good chance.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when it comes to elections, Senator Uba, 62, who served as a Special Assistant on Special Duties and Domestic Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo; elected governor once in 2007 under the PDP platform but was denied by Mr. Obi who challenged his victory in court, and who was subsequently elected Senator for the Anambra South Senatorial District in April 2011, certainly knows how to win, either by the hook or the crook.\n\nHis emergence as APC candidate for the election in a primary poll that party members say never took place, but he nonetheless scored a surprising 230, 201 out of the 348, 490 votes cast by unseen hands, which on a good day would be enough to win the governorship election itself, stands as prove of his capability to perform miracles at the polls.\n\nHis cause will be further strengthened by what appears to be a determination of APC to take Anambra. Obviously the ruling party has eyes on the state as it seeks to make further inroads in the Southeast ahead of 2023, and it has demonstrated capacity to impose itself on states where it has interest, as seen in Kogi, Kano, Osun and elsewhere in the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, fortnight ago, when President Muhammadu Buhari received Uba, accompanied by the partys caretaker committee chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; Governors Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, Yahaya Bello of Kogi, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, who is also Chairman, Campaign Council, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and George Akume, Minister for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs at the State House, Abuja, he declared that he was anxious to see him elected.\n\n\u201cI am happy to formally welcome you. I certainly wish you the best of luck. Im anxious for your success, and will closely follow,\u201d the president told him.\n\nConfidence in the APC camp is growing, as party members in the state hope Buhari\u2019s interest could prove key. Though the primary that produced Uba had threatened to tear the party apart in the state, with the likes of Labour Minister, Chris Ngige; George Moghalu, ex National Auditor of APC and Managing Director of National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), among others insisting that no primary election took place, the party being the ruling party with enough rooms to maneuver, appear to have been able to settle the aggrieved individuals; what APGA has been unable to do.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting more people to defect to the APC because this is the ruling party at the centre and the party has all it takes to win the election. Everybody wants to join the ruling party,\u201d said Ezeigwe.\n\n\u201cYes, APGA is the ruling party in the state, but recent events in the party show that it\u2019s a party in disarray, which is why many of the members are joining the APC.\n\n\u201cThe major problem is the way the party handled its primary. You cannot be disqualifying sitting House of Assembly and House of Reps members under the guise that they are disobedient or something like that. Does it mean that all this while they have been representing the people under the party\u2019s platform, they were disobedient?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just dismiss five people like that. If you do, there would be consequences and that\u2019s what is happening in APGA.\n\n\u201cPart of why APGA will find it difficult is also because, to be honest, Obiano has performed below standard. He has not been able to match the performance of Peter Obi.\u201d\n\nThe election, as expected, will see four top contenders slogging it out on November 6. Soludo of APGA who had appeared to be a clear favourite; Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, candidate of the PDP, a popular platform in the state; Uba of APC and Ifeanyi Ubah, candidate of the YPP who embodies Nnewi aspirations in an election that is essentially an Anambra South Senatorial District affair.",

          "text": "Olusesan Laoye\n\nThe two wards and Local governments Congresses conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) have shown that the ruling party is getting deeper in troubled waters ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe two congresses had indicated that the centre is not likely to hold as they have been used as an avenue to show those who believed they were previously powerful that may no longer count or be relevant going forward.\n\nThe two congresses were characterized with rivalry, sharp division and bickering among party faithful and these have aggravated the already tensed situations in the party.\n\nThose who are mostly affected are the all mighty Jagaban Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Senator Ibikunle Amosu, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola Magnus Abe in Rivers State and others.\n\nFor instance, Tinubu has been badly hit in Lagos. The Jagaban, who some years back could not be challenged in Lagos but right now he is facing the battle of his political life with the Lagos4Lagos group which from all indications, had its Local government parallel Congress endorsed by the National Secretariat of the party, last Tuesday by acknowledging receipt of Lagos4Lagos local government executives and delegates lists as submitted by the group.\n\nLagos4Lagos Movement, is a group within the Lagos APC Lagos chapter, championing the cause for equality and level playing ground among members of the party.\n\nRecall that the state chapter of APC, led by Tunde Balogun, also held a ward and council congresses which had been a subject of controversy in the state. The movement, with this current thrust has taken over the party structure in all the 20 LGAs of Lagos State\n\nBut this development hasn\u2019t gone down well with the Tunde Balogun group, who sources said have filed a petition to the National body of the party.\n\nIn Ogun State both Governor Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor Senator Ibikunle Amosun are still at loggerheads and both the wards and the local governments congresses in the state still confirmed the animosity they have for each other.\n\nThey both held parallel congresses, but from the look of things Governor Abiodun had an edge over Amosun as the former governor\u2019s parallel congresses were not recognized.\n\nThe Local Government Congress Committee of the (APC) to conduct the congress in Ogun State said a parallel event by a group within the party would not be recognised.\n\nThe chairman Wale Ohu of the seven-man committee, said that the parallel congress by Amosun\u2019s group wasa waste of time.While the governors group is led by Yemi Sanusi, the party caretaker chairman in Ogun State, Mr. Amosuns faction, is led by Derin Adebiyi, a former APC chairman in the state. Both groups had inaugurated their executives.\n\nIn Osun states parallel congresses were held between the group loyal to the incumbent Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nThere were mixed reports and reactions, as those in Oyetola\u2019s camp said they adopted consensus method in picking their officers during the two congresses, while those in Aregbesola\u2019s group claimed that they held their ward and Local government congresses across the state.\n\nBut the Aregbesola\u2019s group just like that of Amosun failed to get the endorsement of the National body, as the chairman of the Congress committee, Gbenga Elegbeleye claimed that it endorsed the consensus arrangements of the Oyetola\u2019s camp.The leader of the Aregbesola\u2019s TOP Adelowo Adebiyi said the Oyetola faction manipulated the whole process and argued that they were ready to pursue justice to logical conclusion.\n\nIn Rivers State, where it was said that the Local government congress were peaceful, those in the camp of Senator Magnus Abe, shunned the exercise.\n\nThe situation in Ekiti state has not changed and the fight between Fayemi and Tinubu in the State heightens by the day.\n\nThough those in the Governor Kayofe Fayemi\u2019s camp claimed that there was the LG congresses in the state, those in Tinubu\u2019s group said there was nothing because they have gone to court since the last ward Congress.\n\nSenator Anthony Adeniyi, the coordinator of South West Agenda for Asiwaju Tinubu Presidential bid (SWAGA) in Ekiti state said that over 3,500 members and stakeholders of the party had gone to court and wondered why Fayemi\u2019s factions got their delegates from, because as far as they were concerned, \u201cthere was no local government Congress in Ekiti state because the foundation for it which was the ward Congress was faulty and you can\u2019t build something on nothing\u201d.\n\nStates where there were issues include Oyo, Kwara, Niger, Sokoto, Enugun, Bayelsa, Abia, Imo and Akwa Ibom states.\n\nIn Kwara, the Abdulrasaq vs. Lai Mohammed group held parallel congresses, while there were protests in Niger state which led to violence in some local governments.\n\nThe National chairman of the Extra Ordinary Convention Committee of the party and the governor of Yobe State Mai Mala Buni has said that the whole issues arising from both the ward and the Local government congresses would be resolved and that they would ensure that they bring all warring groups together before the National Congress of the party.\n\nBut as it stands today, it seems the battle line has been drawn in most states and resolutions may not be likely as those holding the advantage are bent to fully exploit it.",

          "title": "Revealed! How Troops crushed fleeing Zamfara, Katsina bandits in Niger",
          "text": "Scores of armed bandits fleeing the ongoing military operation in Zamfara and Katsina states weekend met their waterloo in the hands of soldiers at Maganda village, near Allawa in Shiroro local government area of Niger state.\n\nThe bandits were said to be escaping through the notorious Allawa forest in their hundreds before they were caught up at the military camp stationed at Alawa, and engaged the soldiers in a gun battle for several hours.\n\nAt the end of the gun battle, one soldier was said to be missing while scores of the bandits were neutralised with several others escaping into the forest with bullet injuries.\n\nIt was learnt that those who escaped with serious bullet wounds were still being trailed by the soldiers as the entire forest was being combed in search of the criminals.\n\nBlueprint gathered that six machine guns and a number of AK 47 riffles and bags of ammunition were recovered from the bandits.\n\nA resident of Allawa community, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity said, \u201cMost of the bandits killed all looked like foreigners as they have no resemblance of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIn fact, from the dead bodies that we saw, they are not Nigerians, these are foreigners, all of them are carrying long hairs like women.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have resemblance of Nigerians and they don\u2019t know the terrain. This was why they ran into the soldiers because they did not know that there is military camp there.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that though one soldier was killed by the bandits, the soldiers recorded a huge success by killing several of them.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you, the bodies of the bandits killed are still littered in the bush. This is one of the major breakthroughs recorded by the military in its war against armed bandits in the state in recent time,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt was learnt that the same military camp was April this year attacked by bandits during which it was razed, and later reactivated by the military authorities.\n\nZango Kataf\n\nAnd from Kaduna state, a pastor of ECWA Church Kibori-Asha Awuce in Zangon Kataf local government area of the state, Rev. Silas Yakubu Ali, was reportedly murdered by unknown assailants between Saturday and Sunday.\n\nHis corpse was said to have been discovered Sunday by a search party at Kibori after he left home Saturday.\n\nA statement by the Kaduna state government Sunday said Governor Nasir el-Rufai condoled with the family of the slain cleric and ECWA Church over the gruesome murder.\n\nIn the statement, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the governor also urged security agencies to apprehend the perpetrators of the act to book, while appealing for calm among residents.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have reported to the Kaduna state government the killing of Reverend Silas Yakubu Ali, Pastor of ECWA Church, Kibori-Asha Awuce, in Zangon Kataf LGA, by unknown assailants.\n\n\u201cThe report stated that Reverend Ali departed for Kafanchan on Saturday, and was not heard until his corpse was found by a search party early on Sunday at Kibori community, near Asha-Awuce, where he was apparently attacked and macheted to death.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Kaduna state, Malam Nasir el-Rufai expressed deep sadness at the report of the killing, which he described as horrifying and cruel. The Governor offered prayers for the repose of the soul of the cleric.\n\n\u201cGoing further, Governor el-Rufai sent his condolences to the family of Reverend Silas Yakubu Ali, and to the ECWA Church in Kibori-Asha Awuce, as he prayed for God to grant them fortitude and comfort over this sudden and painful loss.\n\n\u201cThe Governor urged security agencies to intensify efforts towards apprehending the perpetrators of the heinous killing, while appealing to members of the community to maintain calm. Security agencies are conducting investigations in the general area,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nSchool resumption\n\nAnd ahead of school resumption in Kaduna, Monday, the state government has directed administrators and proprietors of public and private conventional and Islamiyya schools to establish security committee to ensure safety of students.\n\nCommissioner for Education, Dr Shehu Usman Mohammed, gave the directive in a statement issued Sunday in Kaduna.\n\nHe urged the schools, including learning centres such as Islamiya and Madrasas to set up school-based security committees for the safeguarding and protection of the students and pupils.\n\nThe state government tasked the school managements to inculcate safe school learning initiatives as directed by the Federal Ministry of Education, adding that members of the school security committee are to ensure proper monitoring of security apparatuses in place and prompt security alertness.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry appreciated the support of all stakeholders in the education sector, security agencies, parents and guardians and the media, and calls on them not to relent in ensuring a safer learning environment for all learners at all levels in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry also expresses its profound gratitude to the general public for their resilience, understanding and continuous support during this trying period.\n\n\u201cWhilst 1st phase of the resumption is already in school writing exams, the Ministry of Education is directing all principals to make arrangements to receive JSS1, JSS2, SS1 and SS2 boarding students on Sunday, September 12th, 2021 and day students on Monday September 13th, 2021 for a period of 14 weeks for the term.\n\n\u201cPrimary 1-6 are to resume on September 27th, 2021 for a period of 12 weeks for the term,\u201d he said\n\nBenue border attack\n\nIn a related development, gunmen suspected to be bandits attacked a border community between Benue and Taraba states, killing one person and abducting many.\n\nThe gunmen, it was gathered, stormed the community and forced residents to flee to Koffai Ahmadu in Takum local government area for safety.\n\nConfirming the incident, the council chairman, Mr Shoban Tikari, said security had been beefed up in the neighbouring communities to avert further breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cOne person was killed in the attack and I recovered the corpse and many others were also said to have been kidnapped. Where the bandits invaded, residents there all ran to Koffai Ahmadu for safety, but they were people from Benue state.\n\n\u201cPeople were also alleging that houses were burnt, but I can also confirm to you that no house was set ablaze as I went to the scene.\n\n\u201cActually, what really happened is that people are referring to Koffai Ahmadu as the centre for the hostilities, but precisely where it took place was at the border between Taraba and Benue states.\n\n\u201cWe have put security in place to restore normalcy in the border communities, especially the operation whirl stroke (whose members) are now camping close to the affected community to avert any further breakdown of law and order,\u201d he added.\n\nOn efforts made to identify the culprits, the council boss added that no arrest had been made by security agencies so far.\n\nThe incident was yet to be confirmed by the state Police command as at the time of this report.\n\nAbuja\n\nMeanwhile, a group of kidnappers is demanding N50 million ransom as precondition for releasing the three persons abducted eight days ago in Pegi Resettlement Area, Kuje in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja.\n\nThe kidnappers had stormed the hilltop area of Zone A of the quiet community, scaled the fence, breached the security lock of the home of Pastor Gabriel Oladapo and kidnapped his wife and two teenage daughters.\n\nBut eight days after, the abductors contacted a distressed Pastor Oladapo, demanding a N50 million ransom and gave a payment deadline.\n\nThey threatened to be hard on one of the victims if the deadline was not met and also deal with the cleric.\n\nThose in the kidnappers\u2019 den are 45-year-old Mrs Bukola Oladapo, 17-year-old Glory Oladapo and 14-year-old Moyo Oladapo.\n\nGlory, the senior daughter and student of Government Secondary School, Pegi, Abuja, was to write her Senior Secondary School Certificate examinations before her kidnap.\n\nSo far, Glory has missed three papers including the English language examination which holds today (Monday).\n\nThough, for obvious reasons, Pastor Oladapo could not be reached for his reaction, the chairman of Pegi Community Development Association (PCDA), Mr Taiwo Addribigbe, lamented incessant incidences of kidnapping in the Resettlement Area, stressing that efforts of security agencies were inadequate to arrest the menace.\n\n\u201cThe residents of this community are poor Nigerians, who, for lack of means to secure decent accommodation elsewhere, came here to sort out their lives, but are living in perpetual fear because of kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt is quite worrisome that Pegi Community is being targeted for repeated incidences of kidnapping. Ever more worrisome is the fact the security agencies are not doing much to deter the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIt beats one\u2019s imagination that the kidnap incidences ravaging Pegi is yet to be crushed by our professional security personnel,\u201d he said adding that perhaps had Pegi been the abode of the rich and powerful the kidnap incidences would long have been contained.\n\nHe appealed to the FCT Police Command, the Nigerian Navy, the civil defence corps and the FCT minister to come to the rescue of the community by stepping up its presence in the area.",

          "text": "Smarting from the flu of herders, farmers\u2019 clashes and sundry security challenges, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) Sunday demanded for power rotation among the North, South and Middle Belt regions to assuage the people\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe umbrella body encompassing the states within the Middle Belt region of the country took the stand at the end of a two-day National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Akwanga, Nasarawa state, Thursday-Friday, September 9-10, 2021.\n\nThe Forum also passed a vote of confidence on the Bitrus-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued by MBF National President Dr Pogu Bitrus and made available to Blueprint in Abuja, the Forum described as unfair the current power arrangement between the North and the South that failed to recognise the Middle Belt geopolitical block.\n\nThey stated that, \u201cAfter extensive deliberations by the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) National Executive Committee (NEC) on a wide range of issues affecting the Middle Belt Region and the nation at large, it was resolved as follows:\n\n\u201cThat, Nigeria has been plunged into a critical situation of insecurity occasioned by the activities of Boko Haram terrorists, armed Fulani militia, kidnappers/bandits and other related criminal elements. This spate of insecurity has pushed the nation to the precipice. NEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to arrest the situation and save the nation from another civil war.\n\n\u201cThat, the incessant invasions by Fulani militia on several communities across the Middle Belt Region in particular, and other parts of the country in general, have assumed genocide/ethnic cleansing scale. These attacks have left in their wake mind-boggling massacres and devastations in our communities and displacement of indigenous Peoples to various Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps.\n\n\u201cNEC calls on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to return displaced communities to their ancestral lands, given the fact that territory can no longer be acquired in the 21st century by the use of force. NEC also calls on the government to identify all IDPs in the Middle Belt Region and provide relief materials for them.\n\n\u201cNEC calls on the Federal Government to identify apprehend and bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against humanity to justice so as to serve as a deterrent to others. Consequently, NEC calls on the government to set up an agency to be called the Middle Belt Development Commission (MBDC) to serve as an intervention agency in addressing the challenges caused by the activities of these terrorists\n\n\u201cThat many schools and places of worship in the Middle Belt Region have remained closed due to the criminal activities of these Fulani kidnappers and bandits. NEC regrets that many school children and other hapless citizens are still languishing in the dens of kidnappers. NEC further appeals to the government to take urgent steps to rescue those in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe MBF insists that the Federal Government must come clean and yield to the demand by the Nigerian public to unveil the identities of the sponsors of Boko Haram, especially the 400 Bureau de change operators as identified by the UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cNEC finds worrisome, given the report by the UN that the Federal government is secretly engaged in negotiations tagged \u2018Sulhu\u2019 with Boko Haram terrorists through which the Federal Government is allegedly offering monetary rewards to insurgents and other criminals.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NEC is totally opposed to this project and also opposed to any form of amnesty to insurgents and other terror groups who have their hands dripping with blood. NEC is also vehemently opposed to any planned recruitment of these so called repentant terrorists into the national security architecture.\n\n\u201cSince democracy is about the wishes and aspirations of the people, NEC calls on both the National Assembly and the Presidency to reconsider their position on electronic transmission of election results and yield to the wishes of the Nigerian people who are demanding 100 percent implementation of electronic transmission of electoral results in order to ensure credibility and transparency in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cNEC commends the Southern Governors and some Governors in the Middle Belt and their State Assemblies for their courage in passing Anti-Open Grazing Laws in their states. NEC condemns in very strong terms the call by Miyetti Allah on its members not to obey the Anti-Open Grazing Laws duly passed in their states, threatening to make states that attempt to implement such a law ungovernable. NEC views this as a clear threat to National Security, and demands that Miyetti Allah officials should be arrested, investigated and prosecuted under our anti-terrorism laws.\n\n\u201cNEC reviews the zoning arrangement as it relates to the Presidency in Nigeria and considers the current arrangement of power rotation between the North and the South as unfair as it has failed to recognize the Middle Belt geopolitical block.\n\n\u201cNEC, therefore, calls on the political actors in Nigeria particularly political parties to henceforth reflect the zoning arrangements for power to rotate between North, South and the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cNEC acknowledges and commends Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state for his resilient stance in the defence of the rights of the Benue people and for his courage and foresight in making the anti-open grazing law even in the face of threats by Miyetti Allah and those other forces,\u201d it said.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cBy the same token, NEC commends Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for his consistent struggle for the Rule of Law and true Federalism, particularly the recent judgment of the Federal High Court on the Value Added Tax (VAT) which has opened the door for the commencement of the struggle for Restructuring of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile noting with concerns the attack by suspected Fulani herders, \u201cNEC resolves that people of the Middle Belt Region should rise up and defend themselves in the face of governments abandoning their Constitutional responsibility of defending them or seeming complicity. \u201cFurthermore, NEC resolves that an attack on any of our communities is henceforth, considered as an attack on all Communities in the Middle Belt Region with the attendant responses and consequences.\u201d",

No fewer than 50 cars were set ablaze in the process.\n\nA similar attack was carried out at the correctional centre in Ubiaja, Edo State; however, the jailbreak was foiled by officers at the facility.\n\nThe inmates, after breaking out from their cells, engaged the correctional officers in a fight, leaving some of the security personnel injured.\n\nIt took a combined effort by officers from the Nigerian Army, 4th brigade, and the Edo command of the Nigeria Police Force, to eventually overpower the inmates and return them to their cells.",

It does not work that way\n\n\u201cThey must face the law. If there\u2019s no deterrent, you are going to encourage more of such impunity and abuses of rights of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nRafsanjani said before amnesty is granted to bandits, the well-being of their victims and families of their victims should be prioritised.\n\nHe added that the repentant bandits are not welcomed into the society because their victims are yet to heal from the agony of their [bandits]\u2019 attacks.\n\n\u201cIf you want to give amnesty, you first must rehabilitate the communities that have suffered against the activities, the atrocities of those who have brought misery to their communities. Then, you can think of having a programme that will deal with people who genuinely surrender.\n\n\u201cA lot of communities are not welcoming those people that the government says they have repented because many communities are still not happy. If you are serious, you first reconcile how to rehabilitate and provide life to those communities that have been destroyed and people whose loved ones have been killed and wounded because of these criminal gangs.\u201d\n\nAmnesty With No Results?\n\nRafsanjani\u2019s comments came less than a week after Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari, also in an interview with Channels Television, said with the recent activities of bandits and information at his disposal, he wouldn\u2019t have granted amnesty to bandits as he did years back.\n\nThe governor said although he doesn\u2019t regret his action, previous efforts in 2016 and 2019 have obviously not yielded any positive result.\n\nMasari is not the only person reconsidering his stand against granting amnesty to bandits. His Zamfara State counterpart, Bello Matawalle, has also said his administration will no longer grant amnesty to bandits in the state.\n\nAccording to him, the decision became necessary since the bandits have failed to embrace the peace initiative earlier extended to them by the state government.\n\nWatch the full interview with Mr Rafsanjani on Newsnight at 9pm on Channels TV.",

          "title": "Taliban Says Men and Women to Study Separately in Gender-segregated Universities",
          "text": "Women in Afghanistan can continue to study in universities, including at the postgraduate level, but classrooms will be gender-segregated and head coverings will be compulsory.\n\nHigher Education Minister Abdul Baqi Haqqani laid out the new policies at a news conference on Sunday, a day after the Taliban raised their flag over the presidential palace, signalling the start of work of the new, all-male government announced last week.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s rise has stoked fears the group would turn back to the draconian rule that defined its first stint in power in Afghanistan 20 years ago. That included the denial of education for girls and women, as well as their exclusion from public life.\n\n\u201cWe will start building on what exists today,\u201d Haqqani said, maintaining the Taliban\u2019s position that its attitudes, particularly towards women, have shifted in the past 20 years.\n\nThe most recent statement comes as the group has sought international legitimacy following its lightning-fast offensive across the country as the United States prepared to withdraw troops by an August 31 deadline. The Taliban took Kabul on August 15.\n\nDespite the Taliban\u2019s posturing, women have been banned from sports and the Taliban has used violence in recent days against female protesters demanding equal rights.\n\nOn Sunday, Haqqani said female university students will face restrictions that include a compulsory dress code. He said hijabs will be mandatory but did not specify if this meant compulsory headscarves or also compulsory face coverings.\n\nGender segregation will also be enforced, he said. \u201cWe will not allow boys and girls to study together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow co-education.\u201d\n\nHe said female students would be taught by women wherever possible. \u201cThanks to God we have a high number of women teachers. We will not face any problems in this. All efforts will be made to find and provide women teachers for female students,\u201d he said.\n\nHaqqani said the subjects being taught would also be reviewed.\n\nWhile he did not elaborate, he said he wanted graduates of Afghanistan\u2019s universities to be competitive with university graduates in the region and the rest of the world.\n\nThe Taliban, which subscribes to a strict and distinct interpretation of Islam, banned music and art during its previous time in power.\n\nThis time around, television has remained and news channels still show women presenters, but the Taliban messaging has been erratic.\n\nIn an interview on Afghanistan\u2019s popular TOLO News, Taliban spokesman Syed Zekrullah Hashmi said women should give birth and raise children, and while the Taliban has not ruled out eventual participation of women in government, the spokesman said, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary that women be in the cabinet.\u201d\n\nThe new higher education policy signals a change from the accepted practice before the Taliban takeover. Universities were co-ed, with men and women studying side by side, and female students did not have to abide by a dress code.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of female university students opted to wear headscarves in line with religious, personal and cultural preferences.\n\nIn elementary and high schools, boys and girls were taught separately before the Taliban came to power.\n\nOn Saturday, a group, apparently made up of women students in black robes that covered them completely from head to foot, demonstrated in Kabul in support of the rules on dress and separate classrooms.\n\nHaqqani said where no women teachers were available special measures would be adopted to ensure separation.\n\n\u201cWhen there is really a need, men can also teach [women] but in accordance with sharia, they should observe the veil,\u201d he said. Classrooms would be curtained off to divide male and female students where necessary and teaching could also be done through streaming or closed circuit TV.\n\nClassrooms divided by curtains have already been seen in many places since the Western-backed government collapse and the Taliban seized Kabul last month.",

          "text": "Britney Spears has announced her engagement to her long-term boyfriend, Sam Asghari. The singer posted a video of the couple showing off the ring on Instagram.\n\nSpears is fighting a legal battle to end her 13-year conservatorship, which controls both her personal life and finances.\n\nShe revealed that the terms of the arrangement were preventing her from marrying Mr Asghari or having more children.\n\nThe conservatorship arrangement was imposed in 2008 when concerns were raised over the singer\u2019s mental health.\n\nMr Asghari posted a separate photo of the ring and the couple kissing.\n\nHis manager, Brandon Cohen, confirmed news of the engagement to People magazine.\n\n\u201cThe couple made their long-standing relationship official today and are deeply touched by the support, dedication and love expressed to them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe couple met on the set of a music video in 2016.\n\nMr Asghari, a 27-year-old personal trainer and actor, was born in the Iranian capital Tehran but moved to Los Angeles at the age of 12.\n\nIn an interview with Forbes earlier this year, he described arriving in the US without speaking any English: \u201cIt was definitely a culture shock, coming out here with a completely different language to speak.\u201d\n\nSpears, 39, has been married twice before. In 2004, she wed her childhood friend Jason Alexander in Las Vegas but the marriage was soon annulled.\n\nLater the same year, she married dancer Kevin Federline, with whom she has two children. The couple divorced in 2007.\n\nLast week, the singer\u2019s father Jamie Spears filed papers in a Los Angeles court to end the conservatorship. She had sought to remove him from the role twice in the last two years.\n\nBritney Spears has previously referred to her father\u2019s treatment of her as \u201ccruelty\u201d. In July, she told a judge that she wished to file charges against her father for \u201cconservator abuse\u201d.\n\nThe court-ordered conservatorship gave Jamie Spears control over his daughter\u2019s estate and other aspects of her life. Mr Spears stepped down as the conservator of his daughter\u2019s personal affairs in 2019 due to health issues, but continued to oversee her business arrangements.",
