          "title": "Adamant minister stops FIIRO DG\u2019s appointment over demoted officer",
          "text": "The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has asked the board of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, stop all process of appointing a substantive DG.\n\nIt was learnt that the directive was as a result of his quest to install Chima Igwe, a demoted official of FIIRO, as the agency\u2019s director general.\n\nIgwe was demoted over alleged certificate fraud.\n\nThe minister was said to have to stop the appointment of a substantive DG until Igwe was cleared.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported happenings at FIIRO since 2019 when Igwe was appointed the acting director general under controversial circumstances.\n\nThe Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission had been petitioned to investigate Igwe\u2019s doctorate, which he had used to obtained several promotions until 2019 when the attestation letter he was parading as proof of the PhD became a subject of investigation.\n\nThe ICPC later revealed that the degree was non-existence, which subsequently led to Igwe\u2019s removal from the DG\u2019s position and demotion by the board.\n\nThe minister, Onu, however, instructed the board to reinstate Igwe as the acting DG, a request that was rejected by the board Chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Gwarzo.\n\nGwarzo, who was presented with the Gani Fawehinmi Integrity Award in 2020 over his role in the matter, later revealed that the minister pushed for the dissolution of the board 10 times because of its refusal to reinstate Igwe.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that since the incident, Onu refused to recognise the present acting Director General, Yemisi Asagbra, until he was ordered to do so by the Presidency.\n\nSeveral attempts by the board to begin the process of installing a substantive director-general were allegedly rebuffed by the minister.\n\nThe latest process was said to have been stalled by Onu in a letter dated May 6, 2021.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Science and Techology, Edet Sunday Akpan, on behalf of Onu, was titled, \u2018Re: Notification and Information.\u2019\n\nIt said, \u201cI am directed by the honourable minister to acknowledge receipt of your letter on the above subject ref. no. FGB/6.01/43 dated April 28, 2021 and inform you that the Presidency has directed that a detailed investigation be carried out by the head of civil service of the federation on the certification of Dr Chima Cartney Igwe as Director-General (FIIRO) with necessary disciplinary action, if required.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, you are further requested to suspend all actions and processes on the appointment of a substantive director-general/CEO for FIIRO; pending the outcome of the investigation and subsequent directives of Mr President on the matter.\u201d\n\nA source at FIIRO told The PUNCH that the investigation Onu referred to had been concluded and did not favour the minister.\n\nThe source explained that after the demotion of Igwe was officially communicated to him in July 2020, he refused to resume at the Lagos office of the agency.\n\nThe source said after about six months and with threats that his salary would be suspended, he resumed, but did not report to his new boss.\n\nThe official said Onu was bent on making him the DG, adding that the minister was waiting for the dissolution of the board.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that the minister prior to this time had written a petition to the presidency, seeking the prosecution of the board for corruption.\n\nA highly credible source told our correspondent that the Ministry of Finance was asked to investigate the allegation.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Accountant General of the Federation received directives; a panel was set up, which came to Lagos. The panel wrote a report and the board and management were cleared of any financial wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cOnu wrote to the Minister of Justice again, who directed an investigation and it was discovered that there was no wrongdoing. So, the last time, the Office of the Head of Service was asked to investigate the issues surrounding the certificate scandal of Igwe. Everybody was invited, including directors. The report, which we learnt cleared the board, has been handed over to the Presidency.\n\n\u201cThe board decided to go ahead with the process of appointing a new director general since it believed that the process had nothing to do with Igwe. The President had already ordered that (Dr Yemisi) Asagbra be the acting DG. The board wrote to the minister for \u2018information and notification\u2019 on this development. But within two days, he sent back a response and said the board should still wait for Igwe to be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that the board had resolved to continue with the process of appointing a substantive DG.\n\nEfforts by our correspondent to speak to the Office of the Head of Service were abortive.\n\nOnu and Igwe did not take their phones, which rang out several times. They did not also respond to text messages seeking their reactions to the allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-corruption group, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, has called on the ICPC to prosecute Igwe.\n\nIn a petition dated June 7, 2021 and addressed to the ICPC, the group\u2019s Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, demanded that Igwe refund all earnings linked to his phantom certificate.\n\nHEDA said if the ICPC failed to prosecute the embattled official, it would head to court \u201cto ensure that justice is served.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria(TRCN) is strengthening capacity of its members of staff across Nigeria as part of effort to intensify clamp down on unqualified teachers.\n\nThe Registrar of the council, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, said this at a two-day Capacity Training Workshop for TRCN coordinators in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory(FCT), in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nThe event is organised by TRCN with funding support from UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation(UNESCO).\n\nAjiboye said that one of the cardinal points of the workshop was to give the necessary training, to intensify clampdown on unqualified teachers across the country.\n\nThe registrar, who noted with concern the damage being done to the education sector by quacks, said the council would not relent in \u201cweeding out these set of people, who assumed that the teaching profession is an all comers affair.\u201d\n\nHe added that the training was aimed at ensuring that members of staff were well acquainted with other workings of the council.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the major reasons we are having this training, to swing into action against unqualified teachers.\n\n\u201cWe started the enforcement in 2020 but because of COVID-19, we stopped.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that TRCN staff are up to date on activities of the organisation, in terms of career path development for teachers.\n\n\u201cWe also want to make sure they are up to date on ministerial strategic plan and also the professional standard for Nigerian teachers and enforcement of TRCN activities.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that if we get them grounded in TRCN programmes, they will be able to go to the level of state and implement our activities.\u201d\n\nAjiboye noted that beyond that, the coordinators, who were representatives of the registrar at the state level, should be able to speak to all the programmes of TRCN, like teaching for excellence.\n\nHe advised schools to prioritise training and retraining of teachers for efficient delivery.\n\nMr Mamadou Lamine, Senior Programme Specialist Education, UNESCO Regional Office, Abuja, said the role being played by UNESCO was to help reposition the education sector in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cthis activity is within the framework of UNESCO\u2019s collaboration with TRCN, which began early this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cUNESCO\u2019s continued collaboration with TRCN is in line with its mandate of coordinating and leading action towards the achievement of the SDG 4.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly relevant for tackling the issues raised in target 4.c.\n\n\u201cThis calls for member states to ensure that teachers and educators are empowered, adequately recruited, well-trained, professionally qualified, motivated and supported within well-resourced, efficient and effectively governed systems.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that UNESCO\u2019s work regarding the development of teachers was specifically in five areas.\n\nAccording to him, they include monitoring of international normative instruments regarding the teaching profession and supporting member states in the development and review of teacher policies and strategies.\n\nHe said that others include, developing capacities for enhancing quality of teaching and learning and improving knowledge and evidence base for implementation and monitoring of teacher target in Education 2030.\n\nLamine stressed that undertaking advocacy and knowledge sharing for the promotion of quality teaching and learning was also an area in focus.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that the UNESCO-TRCN collaboration has been purposeful and strategic.\n\n\u201cUNESCO was part of the team that supported the development of the Career Path Policy for Teachers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note it is one of the policies to be discussed and for which a monitoring strategy will be fashioned during this workshop.\n\n\u201cThis meeting is also relevant to improving the knowledge and evidence base for the implementation and monitoring of the teacher target in Education 2030 focus area of UNESCO\u2019s work,\u201d Lamine said.\n\nHe said, for TRCN to deliver on its mandate to regulate and control the teaching profession at all levels, its personnel must be equipped with the required skills to be relevant and effective at the national and state levels.\n\nHe urged the participants to seize the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and sharpen your skills to be more effective.\n\nNAN\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nCivil Society Organisations, CSOs, Wednesday, blasted members of the National Assembly over leaking roof and flood during sitting.\n\nThe CSOs reacted over Tuesday\u2019s heavy rainfall that halted sitting at lower and upper chambers of the National Assembly that also caused flooding in the complex due to leakage from the roof.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard on the issue, CSOs called for stringent measures to ensure there is no recurrence of the embarrassment witnessed at NASS complex on Tuesday.\n\nShameful, reflects sub-standard contractors \u2014 CAAPA\n\nThe Director of Programmes, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, CAPPA, Philip Jakpor, said, \u201cIt is shameful that despite whopping billions of Naira allocated to rehabilitation of the National Assembly complex yearly the flooding incident could happen. It is not a tornado or hurricane that hit the complex. It is just a few minutes of heavy rain and see how it exposed them.\n\n\u201cWhat it reflects is either our lawmakers are inflating figures and diverting the monies or they are deliberately soliciting the services of quack contractors who procure substandard materials. Someone or some people are not doing their job or look the other way.\n\n\u201cWhichever way, they are not justifying tax payers money. It is our money. Unfortunately we operate in a system where no one is held accountable. They owe us an explanation.\n\n\u201cYes it is time to carry out an audit of the sums they have been getting for rehabilitation of the complex and what they have used them for.\n\n\u201cWe must also look into the processes of selecting contractors and the procurement processes. We should not settle for lame excuses.\u201d\n\nNASS roof leakage, flood show sign of Nigeria leaking \u2014 OLF\n\nThe Founder and President, One Love Foundation, OLF, Patriot Patrick Eholor, said: \u201cWhen I read on social media about the leakage experienced yesterday at the National Assembly, I simply smiled because I was not surprised at all.\n\n\u201cThe country is leaking, that\u2019s just the sign. There is no roof covering Nigeria in the hands of this wicked politician The umbrella is broken..The broom can\u2019t sweep anymore.\n\n\u201cFor crying out loud, I\u2019ve said it repeatedly that we need reforms to checkmate corruption at all tiers and arms of government.\n\n\u201cFor our National legislative complex (NASS) to be leaking during raining season is a monumental disgrace to us as Nation; and all these brouhaha is happening under the watch of \u2018Mr. Integrity\u2019.\n\n\u201cYearly, billions are been budgeted by the same legislatures for the maintenance of the complex but the systemic corruption by both the leadership of National Assembly and the management of the complex is responsible for this avoidable national embarrassment that has ridiculed the nation once again.\n\n\u201cYou can see that no arm of government is exempted from this act of corruption and financial rascality being experience under this dispensation.\n\n\u201cIt is the masses that are suffering the evil being perpetrated by these people \u2013 treasury looters. The masses are the real victims because our leaders don\u2019t care. #39 billion for renovation and we are still seeing leakages. It is a shame.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think it should be investigated properly by bringing to book the contractors that handled the renovation. We cannot continue to destroy our nation by promoting mediocrity and shame. Enough is enough!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s national embarrassment \u2014 CDNDC\n\nCoalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, CDNDC, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, said, \u201cIt is instructive to say that the embarrassing leakage that we saw and the flooding that happened was uncalled for.\n\n\u201cIt is a national embarrassment to see that the National Assembly has no maintenance regime in place or a likely breach of arrangement with a facility maintenance firm.\n\n\u201cThe poor management of the National Assembly facility is also a reflection of the kind of leadership in the saddle, and it is not good enough that both political leadership and bureaucracy allowed this to happen.\u201d\n\nNASS needs maintenance manual \u2014 HOMEF\n\nThe Director, Health For Mother Earth Foundation, HOMEF, Arc Nnimmo Bassey, said, \u201cThe news of the flooded National Assembly complex merely underscored the depth of infrastructural problems in the country.\n\n\u201cSome of the interesting bits of information about the shameful occurrence is that although NASS has taken over the running of the complex, they ceded the refurbishment to the FCDA.\n\n\u201cIf the NASS does not have a works or maintenance department that handles complex renovation tasks, they should at least have a system that is proactive and have sufficient arrangements to avoid the sort of embarrassment that the world has witnessed. It is obvious that the leakage that turned to a deluge must have been noticed when it started but was left to grow over time.\n\n\u201cConceivably this was one of the reasons the NASS budgeted the humungous sum for the renovation of the complex. If that is so, the question is why the legislators had to wait until the situation resulted into what we have seen.\n\n\u201cOur famed poor maintenance culture must be curtailed. We cannot continue to wait until things fall apart before we scamper about for often questionable solutions and contracts.\n\n\u201cThe say goes that to whom much is given, much is also expected. While one may be stretching the issue, we have reasons to wonder whether the shabby handling of the simple maintenance of a physical structure does not give us reason to worry about the readiness or capacity of the NASS in discharging its oversight functions over the performance of agencies of government or even constructing a national constitution that can serve the best interests of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe maintenance of buildings, from the smallest shack to the most complex structures, is something that should be routine. It is never wise to wait for your car to break down before you check to see if it required servicing. Just as machines have maintenance manuals, so should buildings. If the NASS complex has no maintenance manual, it is time that they request for one from the design consultants and from those who made specialist installations in the complex.\n\n\u201cA building maintenance manual would say when roofs should be checked for loose bolts or failing water proofing elements. The manual would also say when metal parts should be checked for rust, when walls should be repainted, when wooden parts would require polishing or painting, when floor finishes would require attention and when electrical and mechanical installations should be routinely maintained.\n\n\u201cOne excuse we have heard for the delay in maintenance of the complex is that a minister raised questions over the project at the Federal Executive Council meeting and this necessitated a delay. Is it not obvious that if the needful had been done on time there would enough time for questioning and responding to the process of project delivery?\n\n\u201cThe NASS management should fully accept the blame for this show or shame. Indeed, they should apologize for showing the entire world the sorry attitude we have to the maintenance of national infrastructure and treasures.\n\n\u201cIt would be helpful for the NASS to review maintenance expenditure budgets over years to be see exactly why the complex has been so badly maintained that it now requires the level of refurbishment that is being contemplated.\u201d\n\nNASS should critically examine amount really spent on renovation of Complex \u2014CISLAC\n\nThe Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Awual Ibrahim Rafsanjani said, \u201cWe want to call on all the relevant authorities handling the renovation of the NASS complex to follow the existing lay down procurement laws and processes in the award of the contract to ensure value for money, transparency, and accountability.\n\n\u201cMore so, this embarrassment caused by leaking roof should not be seized upon by NASS and FCDA to subvert the law in the award of the contract. We are aware that some Honourable Ministers made comments that appear to question the cost of the renovation when the matter came up during a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we call on NASS and FCDA to speed up the process without compromising the need for transparency and accountability to avoid future embarrassment as we are fully in the rainy season.\n\n\u201cWe call on the anti-corruption agencies such as EFCC, ICPC, BPP to be on the watch out for any fraud in the process of warding and implementation of the project.\n\n\u201cWe still want to emphasize that only a relevant part of complex that requires renovation should be considered at the moment due to dwindling resources available to the nation as more pressing needs such as the dilapidated primary health care centres, classrooms, and other essential facilities that the common man uses should also be prioritized.\u201d\n\nWhat happened shows current state of Nigeria \u2014 CN\n\nThe Convener, Concerned Nigerians, CN, Comrade Deji Adeyanju, said, \u201cIt is expected to happen like that at the National Assembly because it is overbloated, and by now we should be running a unicameral system of government in Nigeria because we do not have the resources to fund the two chambers of the National Assembly, by now we should have one building we should be talking about. This thing that happened shows the current and decaying state of Nigeria\n\nAgain it comes to question the quality of people that are in the National Assembly, and this is the same National Assembly that legislative workers and aids are being owed salaries for several months, and for us we are not surprised that such a thing happened; this is a rubberstamp, anti-people and worst legislature in the history of Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026Accuses education Commissioner of frustrating programmes\n\nBy Davies Iheamnachor, Port-Harcourt\n\nYouths said to be students of Port Harcourt Technical and Vocational Center, PHTVC, have staged a peaceful protest against the Rivers State Government over alleged abandament of the skills training centre.\n\nThe protesters claimed that staff members of the centre have attracted attention of World Bank to run the centre after the state abandoned it, but regretted that Commissioner for Education, Kaniye Ebeku, was frustrating every effort to reopen the centre.\n\nThey particularly pleaded with Governor Nyesom Wike to prevail on Ebeku to allow the free training of Rivers State Youths in Port Harcourt to go on, adding that students and staff of the centre may shut the state in protest if the centre was not reopened.\n\nSpeaking, Oluchi Gift David, one of the protesting students urged the governor of the state to prevail on the education commissioner to allow the centre to resume operations.\n\nOluchi said: \u201cWe are begin the Governor to talk talk to the Commissioner of Education to allow go into this training. We are not Happy. This programme was supposed to start since last year. He should help us and talk to the Commissioner.\n\nALSO READ: INEC to deploy 5,346 personnel to 2,673 centres for voter registration\n\nAlso, another beneficiary, Amadi Monarch, noted that beneficiaries were nominated by local government councils, adding that all the trainees have been left stranded following the action of the Commissioner.\n\nAmadi said: \u201cSince last year we, have been waiting for the commencement of this programme. I enrolled to be a computer operator. I want to have this skill to take care of myself and family.\n\n\u201cThis place is ought to have been opened for us to keep off this programme. Once they open here we can start.\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the governor to talk to the Commissioner of Education to give us that access so we can learn and aquire this skills. The Commissioner restricted this particular programme from holding. That is why we are pleading with the governor to prevail on him.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Staff of the Center, Austine Wagor, said all efforts to get the attention of the government through the Commissioner for Education has been turned down. Wagor noted that the facility which was built and equipped with over N500 million of state\u2019s money by the Chibuike Amaechi\u2019s administration has been kept under lock-and-key, calling for speedy intervention by the governor.\n\nWagor said: \u201cWe are here to appeal to our Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, to beg the Commissioner for education to allow us commence the free training of Rivers youths in this centre.\n\n\u201cThis centre was equipped with over N500 million by the state government. For over three years now this centre has been lying fallow, nothing is happening there. The staff members and security men have not been paid for over three years now and the Commissioner who is supposed to source for partners, donors for the utilisation of the center.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the staff members approached World Bank for support and got same, but bemoaned that the state was frustrating the support. Wagor mentioned that over 10,000 youths would benefit from the programme, but maintained that the education commissioner does not want to programme to survive.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe the staff went ahead to source for donors through the World Bank, and they have accepted to bring their money to train Rivers State Youths. All we are asking the Commissioner is allow us use the centre to commence this training. But out of his selfish interest the Commissioner restricted the programme.\n\n\u201cWe told him that the programme will benefit 10,000 youths of the state, social vice will reduce as youths will be engaged, it will also enhance social and economic growth of the state and will be a credit to this administration, but the Commissioner is frustrating the whole efforts.\n\n\u201cDoes he need the people what want to sponsor Rivers State programme for free to give him money? The students for this programme were nominated local government councils. We sent forms across the LGAs to nominate youths that would be trained.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner should please, allow us run tis training. We have written several letters to him begin him. We had also wrote the Commissioner of Police and other offices but he has refused.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Ministry of Education has said protest was ill fated, claiming that Austin Wagor was not an employee of the state. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Sir Chidi Adiele, in a statement claimed that not donor has approached the state over the training centre, noting that the claims were false.\n\nALSO READ: Cattle dealers blame Miyetti Allah for violence in Igboland, Northern regions\n\nAdiele said: \u201cThe attention of the Honourable Commissioner for Education Professor Kaniye Ebeku and the Ministry of Education has been drawn to a phoney protest at the Port Harcourt Technical and Vocational School (PHTVC) organized today, by Austin Wagor. It is unfortunate that he could get anybody to listen to him and even record his bogus claims.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Austin and his co-travellers have no colour of rights to engage in any form of protest regarding the Port Harcourt Technical and Vocational School (PHTVC). They are not staff of the Rivers State Government now and at any time previously and the government owes them no obligation whatsoever;\n\n\u201cContrary to what he has falsely and maliciously alleged, no responsible donor or agency, including the World Bank,has approached the Honourable Commissioner for Education, or the Government of Rivers State regarding any offer to give free training to Rivers State Youths at the PHTVC.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Education challenges any responsible donor who had ever written or approached the Ministry of Education to offer any free training of Rivers State youths in the PHTVC to make that information public.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Afe Babalola: ABUAD will be best in the world",
          "text": "During the inauguration of an Independent Power Project (IPP) and foundation laying of eight projects at the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), its founder, Aare Afe Babalola (SAN), reiterated his vision about building an institution of first choice and global pride in the nearest future, Deputy Editor EMMANUEL OLADESU reports.\n\nThirteen years ago, the site of the university was a big forest inhabited by animals. Today, it has become a centre of teaching, research and development, and a pride to Ekitiland.\n\nSince its inception, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), Ekiti State, has been growing in leaps and bounds. Many university administrators believe that it has become a reference point and role model to many private tertiary institutions.\n\nThe reasons are not far-fetched. Its founder, Afe Babalola(SAN), Aare of Ado-Ekiti, is a stickler for excellence.Thus, apart from grooming many youths on the twin bases of character and learning, the university has also made a difference through its direct contributions to the socio-economic development of the country.\n\nHowever, ABUAD may not be for the poor or indigent. Like most private schools, it is expensive. Yet, it is evident that the eminent lawyer is not running the school for profit-making.The learning environment and facilities justify the tuition fees.\n\nThe institution\u2019s 400-bed multi-system teaching hospital is the talk of the town. It is among the best in Africa. Also, ABUAAD Farm is contributing it quota to food security. Yet, the most significant feature of the university, as disclosed by its authority, is that ABUAAD is \u201cgoing industrial,\u201d through its classic emphasis on entrepreneurship training and a shift from book learning to practical skill acquisition across technical disciplines.\n\nAll these feats are in consonance with the vision of its founder, who has always reiterated his resolve to build a world class institution.\n\nOn Monday, the university made history, following the launch of a multi-billion industrial park with an Independent Power Project(IPP) on the campus. The project will generate 2.5 megawatts, according to Babalola, who described it as the first in any private university in the country.\n\nThe Acting Vice Chancellor, Prof. Smaranda Olarinde, described the project as a no mean accomplishment. She said it would offer the prospect of uninterrupted electricity supply for research, learning and scientific advancement at the institution.\n\nPower outage often affect teaching and learning in many public universities where students also suffer from shortage of educational infrastructure.\n\nOlarinde said ABUAD decided to end the nightmare by taking the bull by the horn. \u201cABUAD decided to venture into this multi-billion naira venture because Nigeria is experiencing the worst phase in power generation and distribution.These have in turn affected the quantum of power available to the citizenry, including the university,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe university don added: \u201cThe most agonising part of it all is that despite the fact that power is not available, there is an unjustifiable increase in tariff.\u201d\n\nThe vice chancellor said that as a solution-oriented university, ABUAD cannot afford to be in darkness, stressing thata the institution cannot sit idly and watch research and innovation being stifled by epileptic and unreliable supply of electricity.\n\nApart from the inauguration of the park and that of the IPP, the foundation of eight other projects were laid at the mega ceremonies on the campus chaired by the Osemawe of Ondo Kingdom, Oba Victor Koladejo.\n\nDignitaries at the Alfa Belford Hall, ABUAD, were Governor Kayode Fayemi, former Governor Segun Oni, COREN President Mrs Magaret Oguntade, NCCIMA chief Hajia Saratu Ilyta Aliu, President of Medical and Dental Association of Nigeria Prof Abba Waziri, former Ekiti State University Vice Chancellor Prof. Israel Orubuloye, Alaaye of Efon Kingdom Oba Emmanuel Aladejare, Owa Ajero of Ijero, Oba Adewole, Mrs Bukola Adeniran, wife of the pro-chancellor, former commissioner Femi Ige, scholars, other monarchs, friends of the institution and students.\n\nThe foundation of the Herbal Drug Production Factory, Intravenous Fluid Manufacturing Factory, Rice Processing Factory, Poundo Yam Factory, Cassava Factory, Pepper Drying and Processing Factory, Bottle Recycling Factory, FESTO Facts Centre and MDF/HDF Wood Processing Factory.\n\nThe foundation of the Intravenous Fluid Manufacturing Factory was laid by Prof. Abba Waziri of the Medical and Dental Association of Nigeria. Laying the foundation of Poundo Yam Factory, the Ajero of Ijero-Ekiti, Oba Adewole, hailed Babalola\u2019s vision. \u201cWe can have pounded yam all year round,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Alaaye of Efon Kingdom, Oba Emmanuel Aladejare, laid the foundation of the Pepper Drying and Processing Factory. Laying that of Bottle Recycling Factory, Ekiti State Governor Fayemi said Babalola\u2019s ideas were worthy of commendation.\n\nThe Pro-Chancellor, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, a former Minister of Education, who laid the foundation of the cassava factory, donated his library to the university.\n\nTo the delight of the university community, one of its products, multi-award winning Miss Mary Adeola Adeyemo, an Oxford-bound ABUAD first class Law graduate, who was offered admission for a PhD programme in Oxford University, England, was presented to the audience.\n\nAdeyemo was the cynosure of all eyes. She was accompanied by her mother. Smiles lit the faces of both mother and daughter as eminent persons in the hall offered their best wishes to the egg head.\n\nHailing the young lawyer and scholar, Olarinde, who read her citation and her letter of admission from Oxford University, described her as a great ambassador of the school and a role model for her generation.\n\nFor her feats, ABUAD gave her a 124,000 dollars (N84million) scholarship for her three year doctoral programme.\n\nBabalola said:\u201dWe have listened to her citation as read by the vice chancellor. Miss Adeyemo had won 20 awards. Her admission to Oxford for PhD without doing LLM is her 21st award.\u201d\n\nAdeyemo thanked ABUAD and Oxford for the honour and opportunity, promising not to let the institutions down.\n\nShe lamented the death of her elder brother, who would have accompanied her, but for the tragedy. To immortalise him, she told reporters that she had instituted an award for the best law student in a particular course.\n\nFor Aare Babalola, it was also a day of honour. He received the \u201cNACCIMA at 60\u2033 and \u2018Nigeria at 60\u2033 Excellence Award in the Practice of Law and Outstanding Contributions to Education in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nExplaining his choice for the honour, Hajia Aliu said Babalola is an exemplary employer, who has never relented in creating more job opportunities for youths.\n\nTo Mrs. Aliu, ABUAD has been bridging the gap between the town and gown, impacting on its immediate environment and surroundings.\n\nThe audience viewed the documentary on the technological innovations and feats of the university. These innovations include rice designer, chicken plucker, oil preser, oil rig!, bio-digester, maize shelter, addictive printer, waste picking machine and meat mincer.\n\nOthers include electric garri fryer, inspection done, maize shelling machine, plastic recycling machine, dust extractor, candle melting machine , paint mixer, wood lathe machine and smart clinic.\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Saad Abubakar, and Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN) who sent goodwill messages, said other men of means should emote the founder. The Sultan lauded Babalola\u2019s vision and enjoined him to always sustain the tempo of excellence.\n\nAkeredolu said Babalola had erected legacies at the bar and in the field of education.\n\nOba Kiladejo praised the legal luminary and educationist for his contributions to the law profession, development of education and other philanthropies.\n\nHe said God has endowed him with a rare energy at old age, which made him to look like an energetic youth.\n\nThe monarch also thanked Adeniran for donating his library to the institution for the advancement of teaching learning and research.\n\nOba Kiladejo, whose last born also attended the institution, added: \u201cHe is a finisher in the colony of starters. Whatever he starts, he finishes. He is a man of honour and excellence. He had achieved all that could be achieved in life and still decided to established a university.\n\n\u201cI also thank you, Aare, for setting up the teaching hospital. He is competing favourably with Ekiti State in terms of IPP. Whatever you lay your hand upon will continue to be blessed.\u201d\n\nDonating his library to ABUAD, Adeniran described Aare Babalola as a man of great accomplishment, whose vision is to make the institution a centre of world excellence.\n\nThe former minister also lauded the founder\u2019s patriotism, saying that, apart from being the greatest investor in Ekiti State, he decided to establish the university in his home state.\n\nIn his speech entitled: \u201cThe value of choice,\u201d Adeniran, a political scientist, lent his voice to the clamour for restructuring, saying that it is desirable.\n\nHe maintained that true federalism is non-negotiable in a highly heterogeneous country like Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFayemi showered encomions on Babalola, who he described as a rare gift to Ekiti and Nigeria.\n\nHe said Babalola is the highest private tax payer in Ekiti and a man endowed with courage and capability.\n\nFayemi said he was amazed by the audacity of his imagination and capacity for task accomplishment.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have laid the foundation of nine projects today. If we calculate the cost, one could be dampened. For him, it is not about the cost of project, but the benefits. ABUAD is fast becoming a state within a state as manifested by the presence of the best hospital and IPP on campus. He has challenged those of us in government.\u201d\n\nFayemi disclosed that the state is planning a 5.5 megawatss of electricity to halt the power outage, assuring that the Ekiti Free Trade Zone and the proposed airport, which are dear to Babalola, would be accomplished in his lifetime.\n\nNoting that ABUAD has become a role model for other institutions in Ekiti and beyond, the governor, who also rejoiced with Miss Adeyemo, promised to work out a financial assistance for her doctoral studies.\n\nFayemi said he wished that the promising lawyer and scholar, who is from Fiditi, Oyo State, were from Ekiti State.\n\nIn his goodwill message, Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), observed that Babalola had made great impact in the law profession and education, urging Nigerians to learn from his footsteps.\n\nHale and hearty, 93-year-old Babalola, who was accompanied by his wife, Yeye Aare Modupe, said ABUAD \u201cis going industrial,\u201d adding that it will continue to partner NACCIMA.\n\nBabalola told the story of his upbringing, saying that although he stopped his education in primary six, he still became very successful in life.\n\nHe said God assisted him to turn a big forest inhabited by animals to a promising university in Nigeria.\n\nFlaunting the achievements of the university, Babalola said:\u201d\u201dEducation is power. Nothing can give you power than education.\u201d\n\nBabalola recalled his exploits in university administration, recalling that he agreed to serve as the Pro-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) on the ground that he would not collect salary.\n\nHe said he served meritoriously, winning the best Pro-Chancellor award twice.\n\nBabalola recalled that students of the miracle centre at UMTE level gave a lot of problems to the university system in the country.\n\nAt 93, Babalola is not tired of adding value. He has built a legacy that will outlast him. The challenge that will face the eminent lawyer is succession. He will need to groom competent successor as chancellor who will continue to drive the vision and sustain the achievements.",

It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the Minister that can talk about it. So, thank you,\u201dhe clarified when he spoke to State House Correspondents after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nAsked to react to ECOWAS Court ruling against Nigeria for suspending the micro-blogging platform, Twitter, Adesina said the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was studying the ruling that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted and would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina affirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage with Twitter has begun to meet.\n\nAdesina said that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\n\u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report.\n\n\u201cNigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed at the Council and the President has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\n\u201cWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, has said the reported roof leakage at the National Assembly has vindicated its request for the approval of N37 billion for the renovation of the complex.\n\nLawan stated this in his remarks on two Points of Order raised by Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Sen. Sabi Abdullahi, during plenary, yesterday.\n\nHe had raised Points of Order 14 and 15 of the Senate Standing Rule in reaction to a report credited to a news medium on \u201croof leakage of the National Assembly complex.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly, was on Tuesday, thrown into chaos, following a massive leakage in the roof of the building housing the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It obstructed Senate plenary session\n\nIn his remarks, Lawan said media reports that the money had been approved and siphoned by the leadership of the National Assembly was false.\n\nHe explained how they secured President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval to ensure the dilapidated structure was fixed immediately.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there was a leakage, to me it is a clear testimony, confirmation and vindication of the position the National Assembly took initially.\n\n\u201cBy the time we came into office and our endorsement, the Speaker and I found it necessary to go round this Senate and we found out dilapidation and degradation.\n\n\u201cIn fact, anyone who sees what we have here knows that this place is overdue for rehabilitation. It is even worse downstairs.\n\n\u201cSo, we complained to the president that there is the need to rehabilitate and renovate the National Assembly complex after in use for about 20 years and not rehabilitated at all.\n\n\u201cThe president was gracious and he asked us to come back, engage the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) who are the owners of this building and the technical side of the National Assembly and some contractors to come up with what we need to rehabilitate here and the cost.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I fought against the initial submissions because I was to take the document directly to the President.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw what they were bringing, I say there was no way I could take that to Mr President, go and rework until they came up with N37 billion and I took that to the president.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, when we approved the budget of N37 billion for the rehabilitation of this complex, it was not a National Assembly budget, it was an FCDA budget, we have nothing to do with this,\u2019\u2019 Lawan said.\n\nTwenty four hours after an early morning downpour flooded the lobby of the two chambers of the National Assembly, Acting Executive Secretary of FCDA, Mrs Zalihau Ahmed, said all the necessary paperwork had been concluded, but said the delayed approval by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), was hampering the take off of the work.\n\nMrs Ahmed said a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) had already been given, paving the way for the take off of the old structure.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the leakage that happened on Tuesday in the National Assembly. Everything is in the table. The National Assembly approved the N37 billion in the 2020 budget. We have done everything. We have also gotten a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP).\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t proceed until the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approves the contract.

He said all 48 exco members of the group attended and voted for the governor without any dissension.\n\nThe NYEF chairman said the group took interest in Mohammed when he defeated a sitting Bauchi governor in 2007 to emerge senator. He said Mohammed again proved his popularity in 2019 when he defeated an incumbent to become Governor of Bauchi State.\n\n\u201cThe boldness and overwhelming passion he displayed in the Senate when he promoted the Doctrine of Necessity motion that steadied the ship of state in the wake of late President Umar Yar\u2019Ardua\u2019s illness and brought peace to the country announced Bala Mohammed\u2019s trajectory as a future national leader who would be needed someday.

          "text": "\u2022Call Mohammed to order, Media leaders urge Buhari\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move, media stakeholders and other Nigerians have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nIn a swift response, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed to order, accusing the minister of being the brain behind the antagonistic amendment bills.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, who spoke yesterday with journalists after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), said although it is an initiative of the government, only the Minister of Information and Culture, Mohammed, can address it.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is not strictly a presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that the president has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\nWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d\n\nThe Media Adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise the government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia Leaders Urged Buhari to Call Information Minister to Order\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE and NUJ have urged the president to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed to order.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the General-Secretary of NGE, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, said the media leaders found it \u201cextremely hard to agree with the Special Adviser (Media) to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, that the presidency has no hand in the proposed media amendment bills before the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that if the president has no hand in the bill, he should ask Mohammed, who is his employee to hands off the matter also.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe insist that the current attempts to criminalise journalism practice in Nigeria will have terrible, huge consequences on our democracy; because an independent press, which the federal government is trying to crush, is one of the indispensable pillars of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe media is referred to as Fourth branch of government because it also supports the balance of power in the government. Without a vibrant and independent press, the whole idea of a democracy system of government begins to deteriorate and after a short period the democracy will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the concept of a free press was purposefully and deliberately invented to preserve freedom of the people, adding that when freedom of the press is threatened, it is a threat to growing democracy.\n\nNUJ has also asked the promoters of the bill to suspend the plot especially now that the presidency has denied involvement in the obnoxious bill.\n\nNUJ President, Mr. Chris Isiguzo, spoke while reacting to the denial by the presidency that they had no hand in the plot.\n\nIsiguzo said having denied involvement, the presidency should follow it up by calling the minister of information to order since it is the same government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe expect the president to quickly call his minister and all those behind these obnoxious bills to order. They should withdraw the bills and ensure that relevant stakeholders are engaged properly before thinking of any amendment.\n\n\u201cOf course, our position is clear. You cannot embark on an amendment that will directly impact us without getting us involved. It\u2019s the same as shaving a man\u2019s head in his absence.\n\n\u201cDenial is not just enough, let the presidency call its officials involved in this anti-people journey to order.\u201d\n\nHe said the media is not afraid of any amendment or regulation but that stakeholders must be allowed to regulate the industry as is the practice in other climes.\n\n\u201cBy the time, we agree on the most appropriate template, we\u2019ll now restart the process. But for now, the entire process should be stepped down,\u201d Isiguzo said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Smuggling Rises to 42m Litres Daily, NNPC Cries Out",
          "text": "\u2022Says subsidy hits N150bn monthly\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday lamented the escalating incidence of petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders, which it puts at a whopping 42 million litres per day.\n\nThe corporation said the unbridled smuggling has increased Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 102 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the oil company stated that the subsidy that the government pays on petrol every month, in order to keep the pump price of petrol stable at N162 per litre now hovers between N140 billion and N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation to be unable to contribute to the Federation Account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, according to a statement yesterday by the corporation\u2019s General Manager, Public Affairs, Dr. Taiye Obateru, said on Tuesday in Abuja when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the EFCC, Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, that smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nSome other groups present during the stakeholders\u2019 meeting organised by the corporation to halt fuel smuggling included: the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association (DAPPMA).\n\nAt the meeting, also attended by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officials, Kyari said the country was bleeding from fuel smuggling, which is increasing the country\u2019s subsidy payment and exacerbating the foreign exchange crisis.\n\nKyari said the gathering was at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari who mandated the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the NNPC, the EFCC and all other security agencies to do everything possible to stop crude oil theft and illicit truck-out of petroleum products, which he described as major economic crimes that have hindered Nigerians from enjoying the benefits of subsidised petroleum products.\n\nHe urged all industry stakeholders to collaborate with the NNPC to ensure that the daily national petroleum products consumption, which shot up to 102 million litres in May, is reduced to about 60 million litres.\n\nHe added that it was obvious that that huge volume of petrol was not consumed by Nigerians alone.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe all agree that smuggling is not a business that should be condoned because even for deregulated petroleum products, it brings extra cost burden on this country both in terms of safety and security of supply and in securing of foreign exchange. It even constitutes more burden to this country when the product involved is a regulated product like Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the increasing price of crude oil at the global market and the OPEC+ production cuts, the country cannot afford to shoulder the cost of smuggling.\n\n\u201cWe all know that our daily consumption is not up to 60 million litres. We all know that, and that is why we have to pull it down. We will pull it down by every means necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said NNPC would introduce advanced cargo declaration in line with global best practices to tackle crude oil theft.\n\nKyari stated that going after smugglers is beyond the call of the corporation, adding that with the involvement of the EFCC, the situation will improve considerably.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots, but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the extant directive from the president that smuggling has to be halted, all the stakeholders must now begin to work together to solve the problem, especially with the involvement of the security agencies.\n\nKyari said Buhari had instructed that the menace must be stopped by every means necessary, and called on the stakeholders present to think outside the box since all the layers of controls that had been put in place before now seemed to have failed.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate and considering other price determinants, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cWhat we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current high volume of daily consumption, the country can no longer sustain subsidy payment, and if the volume is not regulated, the bleeding will continue.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know that so much work is going on, and then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256. The difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201cAnd as long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, the stress of supply and the stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC.\u201d\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, also decried the increasing rate of smuggling but expressed optimism that with the EFCC\u2019s involvement, the situation would change.\n\n\u201cWe brought in the big hammer, and the big hammer as you can see is the EFCC because it is economic sabotage and I believe with the EFCC in the picture, the system will work even better,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that whatever is being done in the area of deregulation will not make any impact without Nigeria knowing exactly its actual daily consumption of petrol.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 million to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous, considering the number of cars we have on the road,\u201d he said.\n\nChairman of the EFCC, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, said since part of the commission\u2019s duty was to ensure the reduction of financial crimes, the EFCC would do all it could to stop smuggling.\n\nBawa assured Nigerians that everything will be done to stop smuggling, ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is served.\n\nHe said smuggling of petroleum products was worrisome, and assured Nigerians that the EFCC was fully committed to the special operation, codenamed \u201cOperation White\u201d designed to check illegal exportation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Refers bill to appropriate committee\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has hinted that the 2021 Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by President Muhammadu Buhari for approval may be passed next Tuesday.\n\nLawan dropped the hint Wednesday while speaking after the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, had led the debate for the second reading of the N895.84 billion supplementary budget for 2021 fiscal year.\n\nHe, therefore, referred the Appropriation Bill sent to the Senate by the president on June 15 to the Senate Committee on Appropriation headed by Senator Jibril Barau.\n\nLawan, who gave the directive after the supplementary appropriation bill passed the second reading on the floor of the Senate, asked the committee to submit its report Tuesday next week.\n\nAccording to him, the report of the panel would be submitted, considered, and passed the same day.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Tuesday, June 15 transmitted the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly for consideration and approval.\n\nThe supplementary budget bill was transmitted via a letter dated 15th June, 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter which was read Tuesday at the commencement of plenary after a 12-day recess by the Senate to mark the second legislative year of the ninth National Assembly, explained that the amount captured in the Bill was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health-related expenditures for treatment of additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states; as well as to procure additional equipment captured in this year\u2019s capital expenditure on defence and security to tackle prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\nThe president also explained to the senators that the supplementary budget will be funded through existing facilities sourced from the World Bank as well as available new facilities.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cLet me seize this opportunity, to express my deep gratitude, for the cooperation and support, of the Leadership and Distinguished Members of the Senate, in our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and address the various security and other challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to prepare the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill considering the urgent need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) have now developed a Covid-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinized these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, additional funds are required to meet our commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in States (NCAPS), as the amount provisioned in the 2021 Appropriation Bill for this purpose was inexplicably cut by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for public service wage adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe Supplementary Budget request is for a total sum of N895, 842, 465, 917 (Eight Hundred and Ninety-Five Billion, Eight Hundred and Forty-Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventeen Naira) only.\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund N45.63 billion of the N83.56 billion required for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme by drawing on existing World Bank loans (which would be restructured) as well as Other Grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\n\u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent component of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emergency areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says AGF studying court ruling on twitter\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move media stakeholders have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who spoke Wednesday with newsmen after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), however, said although it is an initiative of government which only the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, can address.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is not strictly a Presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has given approval that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that the peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts. While 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\n\nThat is the only thing we can talk about FEC today. If there\u2019s any question, then I\u2019ll gladly take. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe media adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has for two years been funding IPI Solutions, a software engineering firm owned by Adamu Garba to produce Crowwe, a platform, that would help the government silence existing social media platforms in the country.\n\nAccording to People's Gazette, more than two years after the Buhari regime invested public funds into Garba\u2019s application, there is little hope, however, that taxpayers would see a bang for the buck.\n\nPeople's Gazette obtained bank documents that carried a transfer of funds from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, a software engineering firm run by Mr Garba.\n\nThe company developed and deployed the Crowwe social media app.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria on May 21, 2019, transferred N136.8million to Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, documents said, marking one of several transfers that sources said the Buhari regime paid to Garba in the course of building the Crowwe app.\n\n\n\nAlthough a major beneficiary of the social media storm that weakened the Goodluck Jonathan administration and amplified the opposition\u2019s messages ahead of the 2015 presidential election, Buhari has relentlessly railed against the negative influence of social media since coming to power.\n\nAfter realising the enormous control that social media has in shaping public opinion, even amongst citizens with little education or financial ability to be on the Internet, Buhari started introducing different tactics to regulate online speech.\n\nA few months after assuming office in 2015, members of his ruling APC pushed a so-called social media bill that civil liberties campaigners said was too offensive to be accepted in a democratic system.\n\nThe bill was summarily defeated, but the government pushed at least two other similar bills, including one that proposed death penalty for online speech, that were defeated under the Bukola Saraki-led parliament.\n\nBut shortly after narrowly securing a second term, Buhari agreed with his aides that it was necessary to control social media, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nSeveral ways to ensure that the government\u2019s message dominated the public space with little to no pushback from citizens were suggested.\n\n\u201cIt was while the government was trying to find ways to control the media space that Adamu Garba\u2019s company was picked as one of the promising businesses that could proffer solutions,\u201d an administration official told People.\n\n\u201cThe seriousness of controlling social media cannot be overplayed.\u201d\n\nGarba earned instant name recognition in 2018 after showing interest in running for president against Buhari.\n\nHe summarily abandoned his campaign and became a recognisable voice in support of the president.\n\nThe regime provided hundreds of millions to Garba\u2019s firm in anticipation that its Crowwe platform would make a sufficient dent on the appeal of Facebook and Twitter, officials briefed on the matter said.\n\nBut two years after funding began and several months after Crowwe was introduced to the public, the app has not appealed to Nigerians on the scale expected by both the regime and its developers.\n\nOnly a few thousand users have signed up, and even then the app has been riddled with complaints around its functionality.\n\nAs part of efforts to give life to Crowwe, Garba sought to push Twitter out of Nigeria, filing a lawsuit against the platform in the wake of last October\u2019s historic #EndSARS campaign.\n\nMore than any other social media rivals, Garba saw Twitter\u2019s presence in Nigeria as an existential threat to his own platform and assumed its exit would push Nigerians to his own platform by default.\n\nBut his expectation was again dashed this month when his platform failed to pick up despite the government\u2019s ban on Twitter. Instead, Garba found his Crowwe app removed from Google Play Store a week after the Twitter ban following a deluge of complaints from users.\n\nHe said the app was taken down to upload, but failed to explain why it was only Crowwe that required being taken down before an update could be pushed to enhance user experience.\n\nThe app was largely unusable that Buhari, his administration officials and supporters had to move to Indian platform Koo following their exit from Twitter earlier this month.\n\nIn his reaction, Garba said, \"We do projects and receive payments from the Central Bank.

Marte Close), off Misau Crescent, off Birnin Kebbi Crescent, Garki II, Abuja.\n\n\u201cApart from granting the corporation possession of the above-mentioned properties, the court also ordered the receiver-manager to take all necessary steps required to realise the assets of the obligor, with a view to paying the outstanding loan in line with Section 553 and 554 of the companies and allied matters act, 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe non-performing loan (NPL) of Abadat Ventures Limited was purchased by AMCON from Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) Plc., during the second phase of eligible bank asset purchases in 2021. Since then, the obligor has been unwilling to repay the loan despite the concessions made available to him by the Corporation in a bid to amicably resolve the bad debt.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that Buhari and his firm remained recalcitrant despite all efforts, negotiations and windows of opportunity provided by AMCON to enable them to repay the huge debt.\n\nThe senate had passed the AMCON amendment bill in April 2021 strengthening the agency in the area of loan recovery.\n\nThe amendment bill empowers AMCON to, amongst others, take possession, manage or sell all properties traced to debtors, whether or not such assets or property is used as security/collateral for obtaining the loan in particular.",
          "summary": "AMCON said a federal high court had graciously directed police, court bailiffs and other security agencies to assist the agency in securing the assets.\n\u201cThe enforced properties include property situate at No 12, St, Petersburg Street, Wuse II, Abuja and Plot 516, (also known as No 2.\nAdvertisement\u201cThe non-performing loan (NPL) of Abadat Ventures Limited was purchased by AMCON from Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) Plc., during the second phase of eligible bank asset purchases in 2021.\nThe senate had passed the AMCON amendment bill in April 2021 strengthening the agency in the area of loan recovery.\nThe amendment bill empowers AMCON to, amongst others, take possession, manage or sell all properties traced to debtors, whether or not such assets or property is used as security/collateral for obtaining the loan in particular.",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up.

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "Why luxury real estate still finds buyers amid economic downturn",
          "text": "In a curious case of twisted law of economics, luxury real estate still finds buyers in the Nigerian property market despite the downturn in economy that has seen incomes drop and consumer purchasing power shrink considerably.\n\nA luxury real estate or home is one that is valued within the top 10 of such properties on the local market. Such properties tend to be considerable in size, located in optimal areas, constructed and finished with high-end materials.\n\nThey are designed with uncommon architectural details and exceptional amenities, and therefore they command and people pay premium prices to acquire them. Usually, luxury real estate suffers market lull in a troubled economy such as Nigeria\u2019s, and immediate follow-up of such a situation is high vacancy factor resulting from subdued demand.\n\nBut this is not the story in the Nigerian market where, though the economy is bad, developers are still putting products on the market and people are buying as if all is well with the economy and purchasing power of individuals.\n\n\u201cThere is huge cash supply caused by the dollar-naira exchange rates. A lot of people, especially the wealthy people in society, are seeking a home for this cash and real estate is about the one and only viable destination,\u201d MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, explained to BusinessDay.\n\nBalogun noted that most of the people who buy do so as an investment, citing Diaspora Nigerians and footballers who, according to him, earn hundreds of pounds and dollars monthly. \u201cThese people don\u2019t buy to live but to invest; these are patient cash; they are not bank loan,\u201d he added.\n\nSince there are still vacancies, now hovering between 30-50 percent, in well-built properties within luxury areas like Ikoyi or Victoria Island, it is clear that the driver is not excess occupier demand, according to Dolapo Omidire, research director at Estate Intel.\n\nRead Also: Sterling Homes at 11 lifts 25,000 families off property market, impacts economy\n\nHe affirmed that luxury residential property developers are taking advantage of the greater liquidity that high net-worth individuals (HNIs) and other individuals with non-institutional capital seemingly have.\n\n\u201cThe developers are sponsoring new projects that these owner-occupiers and \u2018store of value investors\u2019 are eager to buy in spite of high vacancies or rental volatility. As more of these projects start and eventually get sold out, a handful of the units may not be leased or will remain vacant,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhat is happening in the luxury real estate market, apart from being unsustainable, is not a true reflection of the economy but, as Balogun put it, a fallout of government policy that allows people outside the country to import their money home.\n\nThe true reflection of the economy, relative to the property market, is that, because of lay-offs and salary cuts in many organizations as a result of the slowdown in the economy, many people have downgraded their accommodation requirements.\n\nMany of the middle-level workers in the oil and blue-chip industries, who used to occupy posh and large-size apartments, have come down to one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. Some of them who lived on the island have migrated to the mainland, pushing demand and rent for small-size family units in places like Surulere, Ilupeju, Gbagada, Okota, Amuwo Odofin, etc to unimaginable levels.\n\nAnother reason for the curious rise in demand for luxury real estate is corruption in governmental systems where public office holders who embezzle public funds find real estate a ready haven for the stolen money.\n\nAt a recent media programme in Abuja, Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), described the real estate sector of the economy as a major conduit for money laundering in the country.\n\nThe chairman noted that 90 to 100 percent of stolen public funds are used for the procurement of houses and lands, citing a case of a female minister who bought $37.5million property from a bank manager and deposited $20 million cash.\n\nThough Chudi Ubosi, Principal Partner at Ubosi Eleh+Co, does not see what is called luxury properties in the Nigerian market as a luxury in the real sense of it, describing what is happening in the market as pent-up demand, Udo Okonjo, CEO, Fine and Country West Africa, sees some benefits in investing in that space.\n\nOkonjo cited Victoria Island where she mentioned gain in property values and capital appreciation as part of the benefits in investing in luxury real estate, pointing out that VI is a prime location at the nerve centre of Lagos upscale market, financial and business district.\n\n\u201cProperties located in this area will continue to reap economic gains and increase in value. More lucrative jobs, businesses, and recreational activities will continue to enter this marketplace. The effect is an increase in demand for office spaces, business outlets, and housing,\u201d she said.\n\nCompared to other investment assets like bonds and stocks, real estate has lower risk. Its prices will continue to increase through economic constraints long term because of its intrinsic value. In Victoria Island, for instance, luxury real estate is limited in supply due to a fixed amount of land.\n\nLuxury properties attract high net-worth individuals who can afford luxury lifestyles. Because of luxury living in prime locations, there is a strong demand for luxury homes, which is why investors scramble for the limited space in the upper-end locations to cite their investment.",
          "summary": "In a curious case of twisted law of economics, luxury real estate still finds buyers in the Nigerian property market despite the downturn in economy that has seen incomes drop and consumer purchasing power shrink considerably.\nA luxury real estate or home is one that is valued within the top 10 of such properties on the local market.\nAnother reason for the curious rise in demand for luxury real estate is corruption in governmental systems where public office holders who embezzle public funds find real estate a ready haven for the stolen money.\nCompared to other investment assets like bonds and stocks, real estate has lower risk.\nIn Victoria Island, for instance, luxury real estate is limited in supply due to a fixed amount of land.",

Because of the uncertainty as to who these men were at that time, the main concern was maintaining calm and peace.\n\n\u201cAlausa protesters had dispersed and so there were no incidents from that locality.\n\n\u201cWhile making frantic calls to find out who was responsible for the alleged shooting, the governor also monitored hospitals in the area for any casualties.\n\n\u201cHe also went out to see things for himself and visited hospitals including General Hospital in Marina.\n\n\u201cThere were about 13 persons injured at Reddington Hospital, 12 injured at General Hospital, no one presented gunshot wounds, only machete cuts, fractures, and wounds sustained from people tripping over themselves\n\n\u201cThe next day the Governor appealed to residents in a broadcast to stay calm. He also confirmed two deaths, one at Reddington due to blunt force trauma and the other at Yaba.\n\n\u201cThe Oba of Lagos Palace, City Hall, Igbosere High Court and others were attacked. The fire service was prevented by the hoodlums from moving around, he stated.\n\nThe Panel admitted the police incident report covering the material time from 12-30 October.\n\nHe further told the panel that things can legitimately be done without disturbing the rights of another person, saying \u201cthe original intent of the protest was not the outcome that we saw, social media has taught us that people will act without reason just because you have that followership.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Service also appealed to the panel to give a robust framework on how the government can pay more attention to social media trends, among other recommendations.",

And we know it, with desertification, flooding and sorts of challenges that are climate-driven, with the uncertainties of climate and weather, we will be happy to have some of our scholars go into that area.\n\nSpeaking on public health, he noted that \u201cthis is very important, not just for the state of Maryland but for the United States and perhaps, even more profound, for us back in Nigeria. The issues of public health are so obvious.\n\n\u201cI am saying so because you know the challenges that go with it. The rate of population that is higher than GDP growth rate is never good for any nation. And if the provision for infrastructure and interventions cannot catch up with the increasing population it is a problem.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u201cAnd in the case of public health it is very obvious; the challenges for public health are very obvious. There are so many things associated with it. Is it the issue of sanitation, of course, availability or otherwise of portable water? You can go on and of course the obvious public health challenges in terms of the diseases out there are uncountable.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Assistant Vice President, International Affairs of MSU, Yacob Astatke, expressed hope that PhD scholars from Nigeria will take the opportunity provided by TETFund to major on the areas outlined by Bogoro, adding that at the moment, the university has close to fifty PhD scholars from the country.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

They ultimately said he was not a suspect.\n\nA number of cryptocurrency backers around the world on Wednesday posted tweets of condolence.\n\nIn his last public tweet on June 18, McAfee wrote: \u201cAll power corrupts.

          "text": "Following the October 20, 2020 gunshots, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos State Government conspired and surreptitiously transported 20 dead from the Lekki Tollgate to the state pathologist for autopsy, according to SaharaReporters.\n\nThe Lagos State Pathologist, Prof John Obafunwa, conveyed this revelation confidentially to members of the Lagos State EndSARS panel sitting in Lekki, according to a top source.\n\nThe bodies of the Lekki Tollgate victims had already spent three days in the mortuary before being brought before the Pathologist for an autopsy, according to a source familiar with events at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cOn October 24, the Nigerian Army and the Lagos state government transported 20 Lekki massacre victims to a pathologist in Lagos, but they claimed they were persons attempting to get out of Ikoyi prisons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bodies had been at the morgue for three days before being transferred to the pathologist, which is interesting. This is in addition to the 99 bodies they admitted to taking to the pathologist previously, three of which were from Lekki Tollgate, according to the source.\n\nOn June 5, Obafunwa, the Lagos State government\u2019s consultant pathologist, first stated that between October 20 and 24, last year, 99 bodies were deposited in the mortuary of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. Only three of them, he was told, were from Lekki.\n\nNigerians around the country took to the streets in October 2020 to protest police brutality and terrible governance as part of the #EndSARS campaign.\n\nSoldiers from the 81 division\u2019s Bonny Camp, however, attacked the Lekki tollgate, where some demonstrators had congregated, and fired rounds on October 20.\n\nSince the tragedy, there has been debate on the number of people killed.\n\nObafunwa said 99 bodies were received for autopsy between October 20 and 24 during a session of the judicial panel set up to probe the soldiers\u2019 invasion of protesters.\n\nApart from the three bodies believed to have come from Lekki, Obafunwa said the rest were brought in from Surulere, Ikorodu, Ajah, and Fagba, among other places in the state.\n\n\u201cThey told us to conduct autopsies on victims that arrived between the 20th and 21st of January and up to roughly the 24th of January, and we did the autopsies on bodies from Ajah, Surulere, Ikorodu, Fagba, and Ikoyi prisons, totaling 99. But I\u2019m only bringing the three for Lekki,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe pathologist indicated he would have to check his records for the exact date and hour the remains were received.\n\n\u201cI have no idea how many bodies arrived on the 21st. I\u2019d have to go check them out. But I can tell you that we have to finish all the cases between the 20th and the 24th,\u201d he had added.\n\nObafunwa then proceeded to discuss the autopsy findings for each victim.\n\nAccording to him, the first victim was brought in from Lekki Bridge and found to have sustained a laceration on one side of his skull, but died as a result of bleeding in his \u201cchest cavity\u201d and \u201cblunt force injuries to the chest.\u201d\n\nThe second individual was declared dead in the early hours of October 21 after sustaining an open skull fracture, although there was no trace of gunshot injuries, according to Obafunwa.\n\nHe added the second body had hypertension and rib fractures, but the cause of death was \u201cskull and brain injuries related to blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nAccording to the pathologist, the third body died of substantial blood loss as a result of complications from a gunshot wound.\n\nObafunwa was invited to return to the panel on June 19 with reports on the remaining 96 remains after giving his testimony.",

          "text": "The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has urged Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Afenifere to curb acts that could endanger the lives and properties of northerners and other Nigerians in their regions, while assuring of security of other Nigerians in the North.\n\nSpeaking in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a National Executive Council meeting Wednesday at its headquarters in Kaduna, ACF National Chairman Audu Ogbeh commended Ohanaeze for disowning the violent agitation for secession by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nHe said the ACF would soon convene a meeting with the other socio-cultural organisations to address challenges facing all parts of the country.\n\nOgbe said: \u201cThe Forum expressed satisfaction with the recent stand of the Southeast leaders and Governors on the violent agitation for secession from Nigeria by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network. The Forum expressed satisfaction that the Ibo Elders have finally disowned the agitators and called on the elders to take concrete measures to ensure that such agitations come to an end.\n\n\u201cACF wishes to assure that all Ibos who are living in the North are guaranteed their personal security. We have received reports on a daily basis of Northerners, ordinary citizens who are earning their daily life as nail cutters, suya makers, shoe shiners, onion sellers, being bullied, beaten and even killed. We hope these ordinary Northerners are given the same protection we have given the South easterners in our midst.\n\n\u201cThe Forum hopes to meet with leaders of Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo, Afenifere and South-South leaders to discuss the lingering issues in the country that have tended to pitch ethnic and regional groups against each other. The Forum also praised the gallantry of our fighting forces who against all odds have continued to risk their own lives in the fight against banditry and insurgencies.\n\n\u201cThe Forum commended Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi state and Umara Zulum of Borno state, who have demonstrated unusual courage in their fight against terrorism in their states and urged other governors in the North to demonstrate similar bravery in the fight against insecurity that is ruining everything the North has always stood for.\n\n\u201cACF lauded Federal Government\u2019s infrastructural development, while lamenting that \u201cthe North with over 75% proportion of land and highest number of population\u201d has not benefited a fair share of the infrastructure. The Forum decried high interest rates charged by banks on loans, noting that it has continued to suppress local businesses. \u201cWe call on the government to intervene because the collapse of business has direct links with unemployment and insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cThe Forum is not happy with the scant attention paid to animal husbandry by states and Federal Government in the country. Animal husbandry alone accounts for 6% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nigeria spends $1.6 million on importation of milk alone. If animal husbandry is well harnessed it will save Nigeria, this large expenditure.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not aware that those involved in the business of animal husbandry are themselves victims of insecurity their cattle are often rustled and they are kidnapped for ransom too. There is need to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution as those involved in farmers/herdsmen clashes are rural illiterates who sometimes are not comfortable with the police and the modern court system but prefer traditional way of resolving issues.\n\n\u201cThe Forum regretted that Nomadic Education embarked on during the Babangida administration has been abandoned. There is need to revive and expand this laudable programme so that the pastoralists who have been profiled, exploited, abandoned and left behind by the modern society will also acquire skills to live in harmony with their brothers and sisters in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLocal government is not being allowed to work and the failure is having a devastating effect on the security architecture of the country. They must be allowed to work and ACF calls strongly on the Federal Government and the state government to allow the local government to perform the roles and functions they were constitutionally created to perform.\u201d",

While it is true that an initial appropriation of the above stated sum was made due to the decaying nature of the National Assembly Complex which has not witnessed any major maintenance or overhauling since construction, the said amount was reduced to 9 billion naira after the breakout of COVID-19 pandemic. Even with this reduction, the sum of 9 billion or any amount is yet to be cash backed or released to the National Assembly. None of this amount is even appropriated for the National Assembly bureaucracy or its leadership. It must be reiterated that the National Assembly Complex is a National Monument which falls under the purview of control of the Federal Capital Development Agency. In essence, the FCDA is responsible for its maintenance as well as renovation and not the Leadership of the National Assembly as being falsely bandied about. The leakage witnessed at the foyer of the National Assembly yesterday justifies the apprehension of the leadership of the National Assembly and the FCDA and further underscores the need for an urgent intervention in revamping the dilapidated structures within the complex before it falls into further dilapidation with the attendant huge cost of a possible replacement.\n\nSigned\n\nSenator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru Ph.D.\n\nSenate Spokesperson\n\nDated this 23rd day of June, 2021",

I feel this should have been done earlier. The government protested when it was dissatisfied with certain developments. This kind of meeting would have been called much earlier and the embarrassment and inconvenience that Nigerians were subjected to would have been totally avoided. But I think it is a good development that both sides are going to meet,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about the legality of ECOWAS\u2019 involvement in the matter, Falana said: \u201cIn the 60s and 70s it was convenient for dictators in Africa to plead sovereignty that nobody should interfere with our internal affairs but in these days and times, one countries have submitted part of their sovereignties to international bodies, in this case the ECOWAS, Nigeria has ratified the protocols establishing the court as well as the supplementary project, it is therefore too late to rush back home and say we are independent, we are sovereign nation\u201d.\n\nThe Federal Government has since come under fire for its decision to ban the social media platform in the country both from citizens and the international community.\n\nBeyond the ban, the Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami, had also announced that anyone found still using the app would be prosecuted.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the ECOWAS Court of Justice joined the call to condemn the decisions.\n\nThe court restrained the Federal Government from imposing sanctions or harassing, intimidating, arresting, or prosecuting Twitter.\n\nIt also restricted the government from carrying out such actions against any other social media service provider, as well as media houses, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging the government\u2019s suspension of Twitter operations in the country.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has denied claims it\u2019s colluding with marauding bandits who have been responsible for various crimes and atrocities against Nigerians and the Nigerian state.\n\nThe Army was reacting to a submission by Sheikh Ahmad Gumi who had told ARISE News on Wednesday that the Nigerian Military is colluding with bandits responsible for crimes including murder, rape and the kidnapping of schoolchildren.\n\nGumi is, however, widely accused of sympathising with terrorists, and has at several fora called for amnesty for the herdsmen who he says are ready to give up their arms if their demands are met.\n\nOnyema Nwachukwu, a brigadier general and director of Army public relations in a statement on Wednesday said \u201ccontrary to Gumi\u2019s claims, the Nigerian Army remains a bonafide symbol of national unity that has conducted its constitutional responsibilities in the most professional manner in line with global best practices of adherence to the rules of engagement and protection of the fundamental human rights of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nMr Nwachukwu said claims by the Islamic cleric was a calculated attempt to denigrate the Nigerian military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops, who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country.\n\n\u201cThe sweeping allegation peddled by the scholar is not only sad and unfortunate but a calculated attempt to denigrate the Nigerian military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops, who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country. It is essential to remind ourselves that this same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yawuri from kidnappers,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\n\u201cIt must also be pointed out, that while the military is very much receptive to constructive criticism, it should not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals. It is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of destabilization, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cThe NA wishes to reassure law abiding citizens, that troops will continue to conduct themselves professionally in consonance with the code of conduct guiding our operations in all combat engagements, in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution and global best practice. Citizens are enjoined to continue to support military operations by providing useful information to defence and security agencies and together we shall rid our society of these criminal elements.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee.\n\nSpain\u2019s National Court on Monday ruled in favoir of extraditing McAfee, who had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the charges against him were politically motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the U.S.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling was made public on Wednesday and could be appealed. Any final extradition order would also need to get approval from the Spanish Cabinet.\n\nTennessee prosecutors charged McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary. The criminal charges carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.\n\nThe entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona\u2019s international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition.\n\nAP",

          "text": "Two South African brothers who ran a cryptocurrency investment platform called Africypt have vanished with $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin in what could potentially be the biggest cryptocurrency heist in history.\n\nThe incident could spur regulators\u2019 efforts to impose order on the market amid rising cases of fraud.\n\nA Cape Town law firm hired by investors says they can\u2019t locate the brothers, Ameer Cajee who acted as the Chief Operating Officer and Raees Cajee who acted as the Chief Executive Officer and have reported the matter to the Hawks, an elite unit of the national police force.\n\nThe law firm says it\u2019s also told crypto exchanges across the globe should any attempt be made to convert the digital coins.\n\nThe first signs of trouble came in April, as Bitcoin was rocketing to a record. Cajee, the elder brother, informed clients that the company was the victim of a hack. He asked them not to report the incident to lawyers and authorities, as it would slow down the recovery process of the missing funds.\n\nSome skeptical investors roped in the law firm, Hanekom Attorneys, and a separate group started liquidation proceedings against Africrypt.\n\n\u201cWe were immediately suspicious as the announcement implored investors not to take legal action,\u201d Hanekom Attorneys told Bloomberg. \u201cAfricrypt employees lost access to the back-end platforms seven days before the alleged hack.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s investigation found Africrypt\u2019s pooled funds were transferred from its South African accounts and client wallets, and the coins went through tumblers and mixers \u2014 or to other large pools of bitcoin \u2014 to make them essentially untraceable.\n\nCalls to a mobile number for Cajee were immediately directed to a voicemail service. He and his brother, Raees set up Africrypt in 2019 and it provided bumper returns for investors. Calls to Raees also went straight to voicemail. The company website is down.\n\nThe saga is unfolding after last year\u2019s collapse of another South African Bitcoin trader, Mirror Trading International. The losses there, involving about 23,000 digital coins, totalled about $1.2 billion in what was called the biggest crypto scam of 2020, according to a report by Chainalysis. Africrypt investors stand to lose three times as much.\n\nWhile South Africa\u2019s Finance Sector Conduct Authority is also looking into Africrypt, it is currently prohibited from launching a formal investigation because crypto assets are not legally considered financial products, according to the regulator\u2019s head of enforcement, Brandon Topham. The police have not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nChina has recently escalated its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading after a frenzied surge in Bitcoin and other tokens over the past six months heightened longstanding Communist Party concerns about the potential for fraud, money laundering and trading losses by individual investors.\n\nIn January, the daily value of crypto-asset trading exceeded 2 billion rand ($141 million) for the first time in South Africa, suggesting significant appetite in a market that was largely going unchecked by regulatory powers.",
