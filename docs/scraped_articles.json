          "text": "The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria has faulted the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency\u2019s report that over 70 percent of medical drugs being dispensed in Nigeria are substandard.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, the National Chairman of ACPN, Pharm. Adewale Oladigbolu said there is no justification for the report.\n\nNPHCDA had disclosed on its website ahead of the Primary Healthcare Summit tagged, \u2018Re-imaging Primary Health Care in Nigeria\u2019 that over 70 percent of medical drugs being dispensed in Nigeria are substandard and that majority of Nigerians do not have access to health services.\n\nThe agency stated that the country is faced with a number of healthcare challenges.\n\nAccording to the NPHCDA, \u201cMajority of Nigerians do not have access to health services; 20 per cent of all maternal deaths globally occur in Nigeria; infant mortality occurs at a rate of 19 deaths per 1,000 births. Children under five are dying at a rate of 128 per 1,000, while over 70 per cent of medical drugs dispensed in Nigeria are substandard.\n\n\u201cThe weaknesses of the PHC system led to the under-utilisation of the PHC, resulting in significant burden within the health sector, with patients over-lying on tertiary and secondary health care services.\n\n\u201cExorbitant health expenditures to access care place huge financial burdens on households and drive poverty.\u201d\n\nHowever, in his reaction to the claim, the National Chairman of ACPN, Pharm. Adewale Oladigbolu, said the Executive Director of NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, is not the final authority to speak on the quality of medicines in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that probably the executive secretary is being misquoted and because there is no literature that says that 70 per cent of drugs in Nigeria are substandard.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for that kind of report and without mincing words, the executive secretary is not the final authority when it comes to the quality of medicines in Nigeria. The final authority is the director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Mojisola Adeyeye.\n\n\u201cSo far, she (NAFDAC DG) has not issued that statement, the Nigerian community of pharmacists will not believe such statement. It is like trying to rubbish the whole country.\u201d\n\nOladigbolu further noted that there is no scientific backing to the statement.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere is no survey to support it and as I speak to you, I know that NAFDAC will make an appropriate response but from us who are practitioners, there is no justification for that statement. There is no quality assurance survey to justify what the executive director of NPHCDA has said.\n\n\u201cI want to put it on record that we, as Community Pharmacists of Nigeria, want to believe that he is being misquoted because truly, if 70 per cent of medicines in Nigeria are substandard, that means our healthcare is in shambles. And like we all know, people are still surviving.\n\n\u201cPeople still get malaria and still survive. People have hypertension and are being treated and it is an evidence-based treatment. When they take their medicines, they become okay, when you check their blood pressure, they become normal. People have diabetes and their sugar level is being maintained; these are evidence-based.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the Community Pharmacists await the response from the NAFDAC DG to debunk the NPHCDA\u2019s claim on substandard drugs in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the response from NAFDAC, who is the final authority in drug quality in Nigeria to issue a statement to debunk it.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned as practitioners, it is not true that we have 70 per cent of substandard drugs in Nigeria and it is degrading to our healthcare system. So, we will not believe it. There is no scientific backing to it and we will wait for the clarification from the DG of NAFDAC,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Elebeke\n\nThe Federal Government has said the Presidential implementation of over 150 Enabling Business Environment Council, PEBEC, reforms was responsible for moving Nigeria up 39 places on the World Bank Doing Business Index since 2016.\n\nIt also said the implementation made it possible for Nigeria, being twice named as one of the top 10 most improved economies in the world over the last three years, to be one of only two African countries to make this highly-prestigious list in 2019.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this during a visit to the IshK Tolaram Foundation in Lagos, yesterday, said: \u201cTo understand the significance of Nigeria moving up in the World Bank Doing Business Index, we have to recall that between 2007 and 2015, Nigeria lost 64 places in the World Bank ease of doing business ranking.\u201d\n\nHe said as a result of the reforms, the 2018 Sub-national Doing Business report on Nigeria recorded unprecedented improvement, adding that the World Economic Forum, WEF, in its 2018 Global Competitive Report, recognised Nigeria\u2019s business environment as one of the most entrepreneurial in the world, and highlighted Nigeria\u2019s improved competitiveness in enabling business environment.\n\nHe also said the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, CAMA 2020, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s most significant business legislation in three decades, introduced at least 15 new provisions that promoted ease of doing business and reduce regulatory hurdles in Nigeria.\n\nThe minister said PEBEC also collaborated with the National Assembly on the Secured Transaction in Movable Asset Act, STMA, 2017 and the Credit Reporting Act, 2017, which provides a legal framework for collateralization of moveable assets with the creation of the National Collateral Registry, while CRA 2017 enhances credit reporting in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a National Collateral Registry, NCR, of movable assets by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, with the support of the International Financial Corporation , IFC, in May 2016 ensures that functional equivalents of collaterals can be registered. To date, over N1 trillion assets have been uploaded on the Registry,\u201d he said.\n\nOther reforms listed by the minister include visa on arrival for business people, reduction in the time it takes to register a company at the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, through the Company Registration Portal, CRP, from about two weeks to just a few days and the introduction of the electronic filing and payment of federal taxes.\n\nMohammed commended the IshK Tolaram Foundation for its programmes in Nigeria, especially in the areas of healthcare, entrepreneurial and vocational training, saying the artificial limbs provided free of charge had inspired hope for the beneficiaries.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am reliably informed that the Foundation, through its IshK Limb Centres in Lagos and Port Harcourt, and mobile camps, has provided more than 19,000 free prosthetic limbs.\n\n\u201cI am also aware that 242 students have graduated from the Foundation\u2019s vocational skills training programme, while 157 have started earning their livelihood through jobs and start-ups. This is quite impressive and I congratulate the IshK Foundation for this feat.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Programme Director of ISHK Foundation, Ms. Neha Mehra, who conducted the minister round the Lagos centre, said the foundation, which is funded with 25 per cent of the profit from the Tolaram Group, was set up as the next step in a 100-year history of philanthropy at Tolaram.\n\nShe said the Foundation partners with churches, mosques, hospitals and NGOs to identify and support people requiring artificial limbs free of charge.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries of the Foundation\u2019s activities were on hand to brief the minister on how the quality of their lives had been enhanced by such activities.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo kicked out the lawmakers in his judgment in a suit filed by the PDP to challenge the lawmakers\u2019 defection, dismissed all the preliminary objections raised by the sacked lawmakers.\n\nAccording to the judge, \u201cA day must surely come when elected officials, must ask the people who voted for them before defecting to other political parties.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201clawmakers wined and dined under the umbrella of the PDP,\u201d but ditched the party even when there was no justification for their action.\n\n\u201cThe defendants court documents were contrived and filed with loopholes. The papers are manifestly defective,\u201d the judge said while granting all the reliefs sought by the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe action of the 5th to the 25th Defendants is feeble and constitutes an attempt to pull a wool in the eyes of the court.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

He said he found gaps and loopholes in their defence as they tried to twist events to suit their own narratives.\n\nTaiwo noted that they not only defected loudly, \u201cthey took pictures of their defection and were received by the officials of the 26th defendant\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe is no doubt that the defendants can belong to or join any political association and assembly as they are free to do so. I consider the attempts of the 6th \u2013 25th defendants to justify their defection, feeble in the circumstances of this case.\u201d\n\nTaiwo said the public voted for the lawmakers through the plaintiff who sponsored them and they were not elected as independent candidates.\n\n\u201cThey had a vehicle which conveyed them and that vehicle belongs to the plaintiff. They cannot abandon the vehicle,\u201d he held.\n\nThe judge said politicians treat citizens who elected them into power as if they do not matter when they assume office. He said a day will come when elected officers must resign if they migrate to another party \u2014 or seek the permission of the people before they decamp.\n\nHailing the judgment, the Cross River PDP chairman, Venatius Ikem, said: \u201cIt was a heart-warning judgement and a victory for Cross Riverians who voted for PDP in 2019 general election. We commend the judiciary for protecting democracy.\n\n\u201cWe shall quickly take all judicial steps to ensure the affected lawmakers vacante their seats accordingly because it is very clear that they are gone.\n\n\u201cSince the Ebonyi judgement, they know that they have violated all political processes. We shall meet as a party to prepare replacements for those vacant seats this week because it has become imperative.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Cross River House of Assembly, Jona William Eteng, said they have not been officially served the judgment of the Abuja High Court.\n\nEteng, representing Yakurr II state constituency and who also detected to APC, said when they get the details of the judgment they would take necessary steps.",

They came with sophisticated weapons and carried out their acts of destroying both lives, houses and property of the natives.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Governor El-Rufai, in a statement he issued yesterday through the Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the 24-hour curfew was to enable the security agencies stabilise the situation in the affected communities.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

          "text": "\u2022CBN leaves MMR unchanged at 11.5%, predicts moderation in food prices\n\n\u2022Urges NNPC to ensure adequate fuel supply to check price arbitrage by marketers\n\n\u2022Says Infraco up and running, secures N250bn in bridge finance\n\nJames Emejo\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves. Emefiele said this while briefing journalists at the end of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nAfter MPC meeting, the second in 2022, the CBN resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as the interest rate, at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nBut Emefiele urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to take urgent steps to ensure adequate supply of petroleum products in the country to reduce the rate of arbitrary increase in price of these petroleum products by oil marketers.\n\nThe CBN governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concern expressed by Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen. Avuru spoke few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal. Elumelu has his oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nJust about a week ago, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nThe company sated, \u201cAEEPCO remains gravely concerned about the persistent heightened attack on our production facilities and the NCTL. These attacks appear to have escalated in intensity and effect.\n\n\u201cAll our current efforts to sustain and increase crude production are being aggressively undermined, even wiped out by the activities of economic saboteurs whose audacity continues to be growing by the day.\u201d\n\nAiteo disclosed that its NCTL had been targeted, with considerable success, for the sole and devastating objective of aiding crude theft.\n\nThe company stated that given the level of losses, occasioned by massive oil theft, it was experiencing, as joint operator of the NNPC/AITEO JV, it was now left with the unavoidable option of actualising a total exit from the NCTL.\n\n\u201cWe are giving active and urgent consideration to this course of action because the consequences of continuing to operate in this manner now represents an existential threat to our survival,\u201d the firm stated.\n\nThe CBN also left other monetary policy parameters unchanged, namely the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nMPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and it often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain CRR at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe CBN governor said six out of the 10 MPC members present voted to retain monetary parameters, adding that while loosening could trigger liquidity surfeit in the system, a tightening stance would impact the fragile recovery of the economy, reverse credit expansion and yet, fall short of taming inflation.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, however expressed worry that whereas global oil prices had gone up, this had been compounded by shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nThe CBN also expressed optimism that in the medium term, the proposed take-off of the Dangote refinery this year, would help to improve the supply of petroleum products in the country.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN remained optimistic that food prices would trend downwards in 2022 as security agencies sustain efforts to subdue the activities of bandits so as to allow farmers back to their farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd now what we are saying is that if farmers are able to access their farms, do they have the wherewithal to procure the inputs, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs with which they can go back to the farm and farm? We are making all those available. And that is why we still remain reasonably optimistic that food prices would moderate in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the MPC further noted with concern the effect, which the global price increase in petroleum and other products was having on all economies. He pointed out that this had resulted in imported inflation on the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe committee believed that specific actions were required to ensure that the trend did not continue, given the adverse consequences and aggressive rising price level could have on the cost of living and purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele noted that before the Russia-Ukraine war, the MPC was optimistic that the moderate decline in inflation was sustainable due to the positive impact of good harvest on price levels. But it expressed worry that, whereas global prices had gone up, this had been compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nHe added that the rising price of diesel had been compounded by the inadequate electricity supply, which has adversely impacted domestic prices.\n\nThe MPC, however, advised the CBN and the fiscal authorities to take specific and urgent actions to avoid many power generating stations shutdown for turn-around maintenance, resulting in the current unwarranted shutdown of generating assets.\n\nThe CBN said the committee was, nonetheless, relieved that food inflation declined marginally due to good harvest.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cAlthough some scarcity is expected as we approach the planting season, the committee is optimistic that with the high level of strategic grain reserves of the CBN, it is relieved that food prices would remain relatively moderated.\u201d\n\nThe committee further advised the apex bank to redouble its development finance initiatives aimed at boosting domestic food output, which would help in moderating food inflation. going forward, thereby moderating headline inflation.\n\nOn the global scene, the committee noted with concern the recent heightening of uncertainties confronting the recovery of the global economy as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and numerous sanctions against Russia, introduced a new dimension of risk to the tepid recovery of the global economy.\n\nAmong other things, the committee took into cognisance the lingering headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain constraints, rising inflationary pressure, and more recently, the progression of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Bank and Bank of England (BOE).\n\nMembers noted that the on-going war and the resultant sanctions against Russia will continue to have a considerable impact on the global supply chain as both countries are major players in the global commodities market.\n\nEmefiele said global financial conditions were thus, expected to tighten in the short-term as the investment horizon gradually becomes clearer, adding that this is expected to impact capital flows to emerging market economies as risk-averse portfolio investors adopt a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHe said the risks to the overall recovery of the global economy remained heightened and called for cautious policy manoeuvring to avoid a sharp downturn, such as experienced in 2020.\n\nProviding update on the N15 trillion Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infraco), the CBN governor said the company had commenced operation in earnest, adding that it has secured about N250 billion bridged loans to finance three projects.\n\nHe told journalists, \u201cInfraco is set up, the board is running and the MD has been appointed, asset managers have been appointed. We have currently three assets that are under finance. We\u2019ve done bridge finance of almost about N250 billion for that purpose and the remaining sum, asset managers are going to be going into the data room to see the numbers, to determine viability of those roads\u2026Lagos- Ibadan, Abuja-Kano-Kaduna (AKK) project as well as the second Niger Bridge which is almost completed now.\n\n\u201cI am sure we are only meant to complete the funding that the federal government has put into it before now. And we will do it. And the Permanent Secretary, Finance, who also is assisting at least in terms of collaboration between fiscal and monetary authority also assured that there are pipelines of infrastructure to be looked at.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, Infraco as an institution that looks at commercial viability, we will look at each of those projects, determine their commercial viability and determine particularly how would revenue be realised to repay the loans and from there it would be done.\n\n\u201cSo I believe we are on the fast mode and 2022 would be a very aggressive year in the tenure of Infraco.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Party inaugurates media committee\n\n\u2022Sule: APC govs have resolved their differences\n\n\u2022Uzodinma confident March 26 is sacrosanct\n\n\u2022Senate has no consensus candidate, says spokesperson\n\n\u2022How Buni saved Akpanudoedehe after caretaker members threatened to stage walkout\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\n\n\n\n\nFour days to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), slated for this weekend, March 26, Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, yesterday, stormed the national secretariat of the party, where it harmonised the sub-committees and immediately after, inaugurated the media committee for the convention.\n\nBuni, who got to the secretariat around 3:25pm to take charge of the office, arrived to a rousing welcome by members of staff.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the presence of the chairman at the secretariat confirmed that the party would commence the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions today.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Media Committee for the APC Convention, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, said the APC governors had resolved their differences and put behind them all the bickering witnessed in recent weeks.\n\nIn a related development, Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, yesterday, declared that nothing would stop the national convention from holding this weekend. Uzodinma spoke in Abuja after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThat was as the APC caucus in the Senate, yesterday, said it had not endorsed any of its colleagues for the position of national chairman of the party. And facts emerged about how a walkout by CECPC members to protest the presence of sacked APC National Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, at a meeting of the caretaker committee was averted.\n\nThe screening of aspirants ahead of the convention, according to the timetable and schedule of activities, ought to have started last Saturday and ended on Sunday, but the exercise could not commence due to late submission of forms by aspirants.\n\nTHISDAY had reported on Monday that the delayed harmonisation of the screening committees had halted the screening. All things being equal, the screening exercise would commence today following the harmonisation of the committees set up by Buni and Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, who acted while Buni was away.\n\nA party source, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed that the committees had been harmonised and the screening would commence today.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cWe have stopped the sale of forms. The aspirants are still submitting forms, but the sale of forms has been stopped. The screening will commence tomorrow (today). The lists will be ready today (yesterday).\n\n\u201cThe lists of the aspirants are being compiled zone-by-zone, as requested by the screening committee, so that it will be convenient for them during the screening. That\u2019s what they are sorting out now.\u201d\n\nSule stated in Abuja at the inauguration of the media committee and its sub-committees that the rift among the APC governors had been resolved. In a statement issued by the secretary to the committee and Special Adviser to the President on Media, Garba Shehu, the governor revealed that the committee had broken into subcommittees that had moved on to their various assignments aimed at delivering a successful convention.\n\nSule said, \u201cThe leadership of the party under Governor Mai Mala and the members of the caretaker committee are making every effort to take everyone along and I believe it is the only path for a successful convention and victory at elections. We believe in unity in diversity, and this is the mantra of our convention.\u201d\n\nUzodinma reiterated APC\u2019s readiness for the March 26 national convention after a meeting with Buhari.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen at State House, Abuja, the governor said, \u201cOn the APC convention, I don\u2019t know what kind of sign you want to see before you know that the convention will hold on Saturday. As at yesterday (Sunday), all the sub-committees had started meeting. The screening committee, the accreditation committee, and I\u2019m aware that they are only waiting. The venue is being prepared.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know the kind of machines you want, whether you want caterpillar or bulldozer before you now know that there will be convention. I told you people that APC is the party to beat.\n\n\u201cIt is the wish of our opponent to see that APC is scattered, or is not united. But that is their wishful thinking. APC cannot afford to lose what they have, because what we have is the trust of over 200 million people.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t just have a choice, we must remain united to be able to continue with this programme. So, I want to assure you that we\u2019ll have a very peaceful, very successful convention on Saturday. If anybody is thinking otherwise, well, that person should go and pray because God has already approved our convention.\u201d\n\nSenate Has No Consensus Candidate, Says Spokesperson\n\nThe APC caucus in the Senate said it had not endorsed any of its colleagues vying for the office of APC national chairman as consensus candidate.\n\nThree senators \u2013 Abdullahi Adamu, Sani Musa, and Tanko Al-Makura \u2013 are contesting the position of APC national chairman at the party\u2019s convention. There was tension in the red chamber yesterday, when the news went round that the APC senators had settled for Adamu.\n\nA certain report claimed that the leadership of the 9th Senate led by the Senate Leader, Senator Abdullahi Yahaya, made the declaration last Thursday during the launch of Adamu\u2019s campaign headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe development caused serious confusion among the senators, as those of them, who were contacted, denied ever endorsing anyone, let alone, Adamu.\n\nThe senators said they needed the party to move forward with the emergence of an energetic person, who would be elected through a transparent process.\n\nSpokesperson for the senate, Dr. Ajibola Basiru, when contacted, said the APC members in the red chamber had not endorsed any of the aspirants.\n\nBasiru stated, \u201cI am not aware that the APC senate caucus has adopted any senator for the position of the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress. I know that three senators are contesting and there was nowhere or occasion, when we took any decision to adopt any particular candidate.\n\n\u201cWe would be very happy if any of them emerge as the APC national chairman on Saturday. The emergence of any of the three senators would be a good omen to our institution.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the APC senate caucus hasn\u2019t endorsed any of them or agreed to pick any of them as the consensus candidate. Senators Adamu Abdullahi, Sani Musa, and Tanko Al-Makura are in the race.\u201d\n\nHow Buni Saved Akpanudoedehe After Caretaker Members Threatened Walkout\n\nBut for the fervent intervention of the chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni, members of the committee had threatened to stage a walkout if the sacked National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, was allowed to be part of their meeting yesterday.\n\nMembers of the committee had in a leaked notice dated March 8, 2022, and signed by majority of the members, passed a vote of no confidence on Akpanudoedehe. His removal was to be ratified at the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting before it was cancelled following Buni\u2019s return to the leadership of the party.\n\nHowever, at yesterday\u2019s meeting, presided by Buni, members of the committee insisted that they stood by the vote of no confidence passed on the secretary.\n\nA source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that when the meeting commenced, other members of the committee insisted that Akpanudoedehe would not be part of the gathering.\n\nThe source added that it took Buni about an hour to plead with members of the committee, who threatened to walk out if the secretary was allowed to be part of the meeting.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWhen they started the meeting, all other members of the caretaker committee insisted that the secretary cannot sit with them. But the chairman pleaded with them and they threatened to walk out if the secretary should sit. It took the chairman almost an hour to apologise on his behalf.\u201d\n\nThe source said members of the committee told Buni they had been receiving pleas on behalf of the secretary from top ranking members of the party, including governors.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe committee members made the chairman understand that they still stand by the vote of no confidence they passed on him. They told the chairman that it was during the acting period of the Niger State governor, Abubakar Bello, that they really acted as caretaker members, because responsibilities were given to them. Buni apologised and pleaded with them that the days of the caretaker committee were numbered.\u201d\n\nThe source said Buni directed the secretary to formally apologise to other members of the committee and to also apologise to Bello.\n\n\u201cIt was on that note that they allowed him to sit with the committee,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhile the meeting was on, Uzodinma arrived at the party secretariat, apparently to plead on behalf of the secretary.\n\nAnother party source, who equally pleaded anonymity, said some of the governors came to beg on behalf of the secretary.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe governors came to beg on behalf of the national secretary, for him not to be sacked. They want to give him a soft-landing, because if he\u2019s sacked, it\u2019s a dent on his image.\n\n\u201cAlmost 90 per cent of the caretaker committee members voted against him. So, that is what they are addressing now. They want them to temper justice with mercy, so that he can rewrite the wrong. Other issues pertaining to the committee and how to fund the convention are being discussed.\u201d\n\nWhen approached, Akpanudoedehe asked the journalists to look for the National Youth Leader of the party, Ismaeel Ahmed, to brief the press on the outcome of the meeting.\n\nBuhari Support Group Endorses Mustapha\n\nNational Coalition of Buhari Support Organisations (BSO) declared support for the aspiration of Malam Saliu Mustapha, who was vying for the position of APC National Chairman.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by media aide to Mustapha, Mr. Dapo Okubanjo, said the group made its position known during a courtesy call at their campaign headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe group, led by its Chairman, Mr Peter Oganto, said Mustapha was a product of Buhari\u2019s politics.\n\nOganto said, \u201cSaliu Mustapha is a product of Buhari politics, who stood solidly behind the president through thick and thin, and still remained faithful to the cause, in spite of the injustice he has suffered in the party.\n\n\u201cSo, having gone round to see other chairmanship aspirants, we have decided to endorse him as the only one that can truly keep the Buhari legacy alive long after the president must have left office.\u201d\n\nResponding, Mustapha commended the group for their show of support, while also using the opportunity to outline his plans for members of the ruling party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAside from what we are bringing to the table in terms of our 10-point agenda, we are the only ones with real experience of party administration.\n\n\u201cAs a founding APC member, I have enough institutional memory of the party to ensure that members are duly rewarded for their efforts in building the party to what it is today.\u201d\n\nMusa Possess Requisite Qualities to Lead APC, Says Yahaya\n\nGombe State Governor Inuwa Yahaya said the All Progressives Congress (APC) deserved a visionary and highly competent person, like Senator Sani Musa, as its national chairman. Yahaya said Musa possessed the qualities that could lead the APC to victory in the 2023 general election. According to a statement by the media assistant to Musa, Nasir Mohammed, Yahaya stated this when Musa paid a visit to him at the Gombe State Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja yesterday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe APC, in all sincerity of purpose, deserves the best hand to manage its affairs at this time and I am convinced that Senator Sani Musa possesses the right leadership qualities for the job as we head into the national convention.\n\n\u201cI urge Senator Sani Musa to continue with his consultations across all the party leaders and pray for his successful outing at the convention. I will be looking forward to working with him should he emerge the next national chairman of the APC.\u201d\n\nMusa\u2019s visit to Yahaya, the statement added, was in continuation of his consultation with stakeholders and party leaders.\n\nMusa and Yahaya spoke extensively on ways to move the party forward, especially, with regard to the March 26 national convention of the APC.\n\nWhile presenting his agenda for the party if elected as the national chairman, Musa disclosed that he was fully prepared to bring about a visionary leadership to the APC and rejig the entire party architecture in line with international best practices.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Imoke hails judgement\n\n\u2022State govt appeals, files stay of execution\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nBarely two weeks after a Federal High Court in Abuja sacked the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, his deputy and 15 members of the House of Assembly, another court has ordered the immediate removal of two House of Representatives members and 18 legislators of the Cross River State House of Assembly.\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday ordered their removal from office on account of their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nTaiwo, in his judgement, held that the affected federal and state legislators could not continue to occupy office having dumped the party that brought them into office.\n\nThe two House of Representatives members to vacate their office were, Micheal Etaba and Legor Idagbor, those ordered out of the Cross River State House of Assembly included, Eteng William, Joseph Bassey, Odey Agbe, Okon Ephraim, Regina Anyogo, Mathew Olory, Ekpo Bassey, Ogbor Udop, Ekpe Okon, Hillary Bisong, Francis Asuquo, Elvert Ayambem, Davis Etta.\n\nOthers included Sunday Achunekan, Cynthia Nkasi, Edward Ajang, Chris Ogar and Maria Akwaji.\n\nThe sacked lawmakers had joined the Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, and his deputy to dump the PDP for the APC in May last year.\n\nBut the PDP in a suit instituted on its behalf by Mr. Emmanuel Ukala, had approached the court to challenge the legality of the actions of the decampees.\n\nAmong the issues it brought before the court for determination were, \u201cWhether upon a proper interpretation of the provisions of Sections 68 (1)(g) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of ABEGUNDE vs. ONDO STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY (2015), the 6 and 7 Defendants being persons whose election to the House of Representatives was sponsored by the Plaintiff and having become members of another political party, the 26 Defendant, before the expiration of the period for which the House was elected, that is, June 11, 2019 to June 10, 2023, the 6 and 7 defendants have not thereby vacated their seats in the House of Representatives?\n\n\u201cWhether upon a proper interpretation of the provisions of Section 109 (1)(g) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of ABEGUNDE V. ONDO STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, (2015), the 8 to 25 Defendants being persons whose election to the Cross River State House of Assembly were sponsored by the Plaintiff and having become members of another political party, the 26 defendant, before expiration of the period for which the House was elected, that is, June 11, 2019 to June 10, 2023, the 8 to 25 defendants have not thereby vacated their seats in the Cross River State House of Assembly?\u201d\n\nPDP submitted that if the above questions were answered in its favour, then the court should go ahead to declare their seats vacant on account of their defection to the APC.\n\nPDP then prayed the court for an Order of Injunction restraining the six to the 25 Defendants, respectively or collectively from acting or in any manner howsoever continuing to act as members of House of Representatives and Cross River State House of Assembly haven defected to the APC.\n\nThe PDP further sought another order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Speaker of the House of Representatives, Clerk of the National Assembly, and Clark of the Cross River State House of Assembly, who were the first to fifth defendants, respectively, from continuing to recognise the defectors as legislators on account of their defection.\n\nThe main opposition party sought, \u201cAn Order of Mandatory Injunction compelling the 1st defendant to accept from the Plaintiff the list of its candidates for the purpose of filling the vacancy created by the exit of the 6 to 25 defendants from the House of Representatives (for the 6th and 7th Defendants), and the Cross River State House of Assembly (for the 8 to 25 defendants) by reason of becoming members of a different political party, (the All Progressives Congress) before the expiration of the term for which they were elected into office and the sponsorship of the Plaintiff and to present certificate of return to the said candidates contained in the Plaintiff List, alternatively for an order compelling the 1st defendant to conduct election (within 90 days) into the offices formerly occupied by the 6th to 25th defendants now vacant by operation of Sections 68(1)(g) and 109 (1g) of the Constitution.\n\nDelivering judgement in the suit, Taiwo held that the case of the plaintiff had merit and accordingly granted the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs.\n\nThe court earlier dismissed the submission of the defendants challenging jurisdiction, maintaining, \u201cThere is nothing against the law that the suit be heard by this court,\u201d adding that the 6-25th defendants are joined with other defendants who have their offices in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWhere there are more than one defendant, the suit can be established anywhere subject to the discretion of the court,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI find no merit in the application for transfer.\u201d\n\nTaiwo, similarly, dismissed claims by the sacked lawmakers that there was disagreement in the PDP, which led to their expulsion from the party.\n\nWhile he held that the defendants were free to belong to or join any political association and assembly of their choice, the court stressed that this freedom or liberty ended where others\u2019 started.\n\nHe said, \u201cI consider the attempts of the 6th \u2013 25th defendants to justify their defection, feeble in the circumstances of this case,\u201d adding that the public voted for the lawmakers through the plaintiff who sponsored them and they were not voted for as independent candidates.\n\n\u201cThey had a vehicle which conveyed them and that vehicle belongs to the plaintiff. They cannot abandon the vehicle,\u201d he held.\n\nTaiwo further remarked that politicians treated citizens that elected them into power as if they did not matter, adding that a day will come when elected officers must resign their post if they migrate to another party or seek the permission of the people before they decamp.\n\nHaving agreed with the plaintiff that the defendants\u2019 continued stay in office amounted to an illegality, having crossed over to another party and also holding that votes belong to a political party and that the electorates voted for the legislators because they contested under the platform of the PDP and not in their individual capacity, the judge, therefore, ordered them to vacate office immediately.\n\nThe court also held that the plaintiff could forward names of its candidates to fill the vacant seat or in the alternative INEC should conduct another election within 90 days.\n\nAnother judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Inyang Ekwo, had on March 8, sacked 15 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly as well as Governor Dave Umahi and his deputy for defection.\n\nHe had held that votes in an election do not only belong to political parties but such votes cannot be transferred from party to party by politicians when they decamped from one party to another.\n\nJudgment was however awaited in a suit filed against Ayade and his deputy.\n\nImoke: Judgement, Restoration of C\u2019River Democratic Mandates\n\nFormer Governor of Cross River State and leader of the PDP in the state, Sen. Liyel Imoke, described the judgement as a restoration of the democratic mandates given to the PDP by citizens of the state. Members of the State House of assembly who decamped from the PDP to the AP) alongside Gov. Ben Ayade last year.\n\nImoke said, \u201cSince the defection of Governor Ayade and some members of the state assembly; depriving the PDP of its constitutional mandates, I have never been in doubt that the judiciary will intervene and restore those mandates.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s judgement by the Federal High Court, Abuja is a testimony that the judiciary is a formidable constitutional safeguard for Nigeria\u2019s democracy; the verdict in all accounts is a restoration of the democratic mandates given to the PDP by the voters at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cFor Cross River PDP, this judgement is a clear testimony that as a party, our resolve to adhere to the extant laws and the 1999 Constitution has been fruitful and beneficial to our pursuit of truth, and this will continue to guide our activities and operations as party faithfuls.\u201d\n\nHe said the judgement would go a long way to fortify the belief of PDP members in Cross River State, and their firm conviction and faith on the party going forward.\n\nThe former governor charged party members in the state to remain steadfast and dedicated to strengthening the PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections, and ensure that all efforts are geared towards ensuring a resounding victory for the party in Cross River and nationwide.\n\nCross River Govt Appeals, Files Motion for State of Execution\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement late yesterday night, the Cross River State government, through the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Mr Christian Ita, announced that it had filed an appeal against the judgement and a motion to stay the execution of the judgement. The reads; \u201cThis is to inform All Progressives Congress (APC) members of the National Assembly from members of the Cross River State House of Assembly and the general public that an appeal against the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja has been filed at the Court of Appeal, Abuja.\n\nAlso, a motion for a stay of execution of the Federal High Court has been filed.

          "text": "\n\n*Holds serving governors, other members of committee not on paid employment\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Y. Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court has dismissed a suit challenging the legality of the Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHalilu, in a judgement delivered March 1, with its Certified True Copy Dated March 18, which was sighted by THISDAY, held that the claimant woefully failed to prove allegations made against the defendants.\n\n\n\nThe claimant, former Chairman of the Kwara State APC, Bashir Bolarinwa, had last year dragged the party and members of CECPC to court challenging the legality of the committee set up June 25, 2020 as well as his removal as Kwara State APC Chairman. Bolarinwa also challenged the powers of APC\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) to dissolve the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee in 2020, among other issues.\n\n\n\nAPC, CECPC Chairman Mai Mala Buni, John Akpanudoedehe, Abubakar Bello, Isiaka Bello, Stella Okotete, Professor Tahir Mamman, Ken Nnamani, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon Akinremi Olaide, Dr. James Lalu, Chief David Lyon, Senator Abba Ali, Ismael Ahmed, and Abdulahi Samario, were the first to 15th defendants, respectively, in the suit.\n\nAmong the issues Bolarinwa took to court for determination were: whether the appointment of the 2, 4, and 5 defendants, being serving governors of Yobe, Niger and Osun states respectively, as Chairman and members of CECPC of the APC, was legal and constitutional, having regard to the provisions of Section 183and 223 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nHe said if the question was answered in the negative, whether their appointment was not a gross violation of the constitution.\n\nClaimant further urged the court to determine whether the decision of the APC NEC made on December 8, 2020 to extend the tenure of the CECPC for a period of six months was valid, having regard to Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nAmong the declarations Bolarinwa sought from the court was that Buni and the other serving governors\u2019 presence in CECPC was illegal and unconstitutional with regard to Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution. He further called for another declaration that having violated the provisions of Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution, the governors were no longer entitled to Section 308, which guaranteed their immunity from prosecution.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the claimant urged the court to declare that all decisions and actions taken by CECPC from June 25, 2020 till they were removed from office were illegal, null and void, having regard to Section 183, 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nThe court was then urged for an order removing the second to 14th defendants from office as chairman and members of CECPC, as well as another nullifying and setting aside all actions and purported removal of claimant by the second to 14th defendants on January 4, 2021\n\nBolarinwa had sought, \u201cAn order nullifying and setting aside the purported ward congresses conducted by the CECPC in Kwara State on July 31, 2021\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the first to 14th defendants from conducting any other congresses into any office in the APC pursuant to the Notice of Congress issued by the second to 14th defendants or from performing any other functions in their capacities as CEPCC.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after an examination of the case of the claimant, the court came to the conclusion that the, \u201cContention of the claimant is borne out of the misinterpretation and misconception of the provisions of Sections 183, 223 of the constitution as well as provisions referred to in this case which clearly shows the claimant\u2019s failure to appreciate the essence and purpose of the resolution of the APC\u2019s NEC on June 25, 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court also noted that the fulcrum of the claimant\u2019s complaint against the dissolution of the NWC were that the appointment of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th defendants contravened Section 183 and Article 17 of APC and that the appointment of CECPC by NEC to take the place of NWC was not democratic in line with Section 223 of the constitution.\n\nThe court explained that all the allegations were denied by the defendants, thereby putting the claimant to the strictest proof of the same.\n\nAccording to the judge, the claimant could not prove that the governors and other members of CECPC, who are sitting and serving members took up the appointment in full capacity or are in paid employment in that executive official capacity to constitute an infraction or contravention of the provision of Section 183 of the constitution.\n\nHalilu stated that the counter affidavits of the defendants also showed that they were constituted to temporarily perform the function of conducting the national convention of APC and nothing more.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the dissolution of the Oshiomhole NWC, the court held that NEC did not violate the constitution of the party as Article 13 (3) of the APC constitution empowered it to intervene when there was crisis in the running of the party and that by setting up CECPC, which was mandated to conducted a national convention to elect new NWC, , NEC was in order.\n\n\n\nThe judge further explained that Section 223 of the constitution was not a guarantee of tenure of office of four years but rather for the conduct of election into the party elective offices by political parties.\n\nOn the removal of the claimant by CECPC in January last year, the court held that he who had power to appoint also had the power to fire, adding that NEC donated its powers to CECPC when it inaugurated the committee to replace the NWC in the interim.\n\n\n\nThe judge accordingly dismissed the suit for lacking in merit.\n\nHalilu held, \u201cClaimant has woefully failed to justify the grant of reliefs sought in his originating summons. The entire suit having regards to the facts and circumstances of the same, constitute an abuse of judicial process and liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI shall dismiss the said suit by consigning the same to a forlorn of judicial debris.\n\n\u201cAccordingly suit number CV/2006/2021 is hereby dismissed for the reason advanced.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Tangerine Africa, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nhe told me to stop wearing dresses. that i need to wear jackets & trouser suit all the time (presumably to cover my breasts) after his gf alice commented saying she liked them\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

According to reports, a 6-year-old Boeing 737-800 carrying 132 people crashed after it sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 feet to 3,225 feet in three minutes.\n\nMy reaction to the unfortunate news was, \u201cBoeing, not again!\u201d after I remembered a Netflix documentary, Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, detailing the Boeing MAX 737 scandal.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I mentioned how real-crime documentaries leave me upset and how I\u2019m, unfortunately, obsessed with them. If you\u2019re wondering what upsets me about these documentaries outside the crimes, it\u2019s how little justice is served if ever it gets done. There\u2019s only so much the heart can take, you know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, let\u2019s get into what we\u2019re discussing this today:\n\nOf scandals and toxic work cultures\n\nLendsqr: Shopify for African lenders\n\nFund rain in Kenya\n\nOf toxic workplace cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian Tech Twitter came alive yesterday following an investigative piece by TechCabal\u2019s Damilare Dosumu about Nigerian payroll startup, Bento Africa\u2019s co-founder/CEO, Ebun Okubanjo, who was accused of verbal abuse, undeserved termination of employment, inappropriate behaviour, and overall toxicity at the workplace.\n\nThe article, which incited a lot of emotions, took a long time to put together before a break came in March, as revealed by the author. This was after initial efforts to be granted interviews by former employees failed. Eventually, some ex-staff and current workers at the startup contributed to the piece either anonymously or with full disclosure.\n\nGet the full gist: Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa\n\nThe central topic of discussion \u2014 toxic workplace cultures \u2014 has been escalated by different people who have either been recipients of such harsh conditions at other organisations or have had to come to the rescue of someone who was. Asides from that, there\u2019s been a lot of finger-pointing, too many to keep track of.\n\nIf anything, the attending reactions have encouraged more people to speak up; some legal personnel were seen promising support to anyone interested in litigation and health workers encouraged victims to consider therapy. Consequently, a Twitter Space with over 17,000 participants at its peak and ran for more than five hours had people sharing experiences.\n\nAll these leave some questions behind. When the initial rage wears out, what would be the long term implications of discoveries like this? Would it push employers to be deliberate about promoting a healthy workplace culture? Could it encourage more aggrieved employees to speak out in real-time to expose any infringement on rights? Does this mean Africans will give sincere reviews about companies without fear on platforms like Glassdoor?\n\nFor a moment, it appears we\u2019re moving away from the reality that protecting employee interest in the Nigerian tech space is harder than it looks. And, I think that\u2019s great. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopify for African lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Founder, Lendsqr\n\nEfforts to help Africans build strong credit muscles didn\u2019t start today, and they are coming in different forms. From digital lending platforms to buy-now-pay-later models, to loan retrieval solutions.\n\nIn a recent development, Adedeji Olowe, Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria, came up with a solution to give credit access to Africans, a pretty tricky space to play, in my opinion. However, leaning on his neck-deep experience in the fintech space, he seems to have covered the basics.\n\nRead his story here: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nThe deets: Deciding not to go the conventional way, the resulting startup, Lendsqr\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\nHow is it doing this? Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nSo far, the founder claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of information to unpack, why don\u2019t you enjoy the full story as written by Emmanuel Paul.\n\nRead here: Lendsqr is building the Shopify for lending in Africa\n\nFund rain in Kenya: Powered by People, Apollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Eli Pollak (Co-founder & CEO), Benjamin Njenga (Co-founder & CCO), and Earl St Sauver (Co-founder).

Doesn\u2019t it seem investors are seeing what many people aren\u2019t? Last week, it was Wasoko(formerly, Sokowatch) raising $125m series B led by Tiger Global. Months before that, five other eCommerce startups have raised $275m combined in VC fund and debt financing.\n\nYesterday, Kenya-based Powered by People raised a $5m seed led by Susa Ventures and Golden Ventures with participation from a number of investors including Flexport Ventures, J Ventures, and the founders of DraftKings and Fabric.\n\nThe startup powers a B2B eCommerce marketplace to connect small businesses with retailers while removing any supply chain inconveniences, thereby giving them visibility into both local and international retail markets.\n\nPowered by People also offers credit facilities to businesses to help speed up production so as to meet up with demand. The fund raised is to get more clients and increase the startup\u2019s reach across borders.\n\nConsidering its trajectory, the three-year-old startup expects to grow its annual run rate to $25m from $15m.\n\nRead more: Kenya-based Powered by People gets $5 million seed to scale operations of its wholesale e-commerce platform\n\nIn another news, Kenyan-founded agritech startup, Apollo raised $40m in a Series B round led by Softbank with participation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Yara Growth Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst, CDC, among others.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulties in Africa\u2019s financial sector create room for many opportunities. Like a giant onion bulb, when one financial service issue is resolved, other layers reveal more issues to be solved.\n\nWhen businesses found it difficult to receive payments online, people hurt under ridiculous bank charges, but fintech companies have come to the rescue.\n\nToday, financial inclusion has improved considerably from previous years. For example, Nigeria\u2019s banked adult population has increased from 36 million in 2016 to 47.7 million in 2020. As of March 13, 2022, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) places the number of Nigerian bank account holders at 53 million.\n\nHowever, the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion growth has come from savings and payments, leaving a considerable gap in the credit and insurance space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Open Banking Nigeria Trustee, believes that unlocking credit access is a surer method of boosting financial inclusion in Africa. Tying into his ambition to democratise banking in Nigeria, he is currently building Lendsqr, a startup that would create large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\n\u201cI believe that without an evolving middle-class, we may not come out of our national morass. But without credit to help people stand up, the middle-class wouldn\u2019t emerge.\u201d\n\nWith over two decades of experience in banking, credit, technology, and venture capital, Olowe delved into lending in his two-year (2006 \u2013 2008) stint at First City Monument Bank (FCMB), one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, where he built a lending system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nOlowe, who is on the boards of Sparkle and Paystack, has been neck-deep in Nigeria\u2019s financial space, having previously been the chairman of TeamApt.\n\nOlowe is currently building a reputation as Africa\u2019s Open Banking leader, and our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, went behind the scenes of his enviable LinkedIn profile. However, building any lending solution is tough, but what the fintech mogul has planned with Lendsqr is a different beast entirely.\n\nThe stubborn onion bulb\n\nNigeria\u2019s lending space could be likened to the difficult parts of the onion bulb that are not so straightforward to peel. Accessing credit in Nigeria is difficult, and for good reasons.\n\nA 2021 Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) report reveals that in 2020, only 3% of Nigeria\u2019s 106 million adults had access to credit from a regulated financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a low percentage points to a considerable gap, and per Lendqr\u2019s analysis, the credit market is worth \u20a672 trillion ($173.5 billion) in Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraditional financial institutions should be jumping at the opportunity, right? Apparently not, and for a good reason.\n\nMost financial institutions across Africa are only willing to lend to the most creditworthy of borrowers like governments, large corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. The scenario is different for small businesses and regular individuals.\n\n\u201cSmall firms and individuals borrow at high rates because of the high risks involved as lenders do not have information on their credit behaviours,\u201d said Juma Reli, Bank of Tanzania Deputy Governor, at the launch of the country\u2019s official databank.\n\nIn recent years, several digital lending platforms have sprung up in Nigeria, but going by current events, most have been operating illegally and unethically. The few legal ones constantly deal with loan defaulters.\n\nIn 2009, just 15 million Kenyans had access to credit, but that number rose by 7.2 million in the next seven years.\n\nHowever, loan defaulters and rogue lenders are also increasing.\n\nAll things considered, Olowe believes it may be hard to blame institutional lenders. The average Nigerian\u2019s credit score has not improved considerably, and the low lending percentage says it all.\n\n\u201cThen came the light bulb moment \u2014 what if tech and data are combined, made available at bargain prices, to enable lenders to lend securely and responsibly? Wouldn\u2019t that make lenders expand? Wouldn\u2019t that curb chronic debtors and block them from abusing credits?\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that make institutional investors make capital available to lenders? Wouldn\u2019t lenders be able to reach Africans at the point of need through BNPL?\u201d Olowe asks.\n\nProviding a solution\n\nTo tackle the issues with lending, Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nAn excellent way to explain the startup\u2019s value offering would be Canadian tech giant, Shopify. The platform allows retailers to create and manage their online stores. If you have anything to sell online, Shopify takes the pains of creating your website and lets you customise the platform to attract visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Lendsqr provides a platform for any company interested in entering the lending game.\n\n\u201cOur stack has 100% of everything a lender needs to lend. And they can register and issue their first loan in five minutes, running off one of the largest data repositories for credit in Nigeria. All for free.\u201d\n\nFor context, data on a business or an individual is critical for any lending decision. Your employment history, your income level, and your debt-to-income ratio all come into play. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of data variables to choose from.\n\nOlowe explains that this data comes from lenders already on Lendsqr and from other established lenders, who he prefers to keep secret for now. Lendsqr is also plugged into the CRC Credit Bureau and Credit Registry.\n\nRecall that in 2020, a former OKash CEO went on to create a Blacklist, a platform for small digital lenders to access data on Nigerian borrowers.\n\nThe Blacklist creator, Darlington Onyeagoro, who\u2019s currently CEO of Aladdin, a digital bank, argued that such a platform would create little escape room for serial defaulters.\n\nOn the flip side, such a platform can be positively used by lenders to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWe plan to use this data to unleash credit for the underbanked. And we\u2019re powering our lenders to reach their customers via our Web app, Android app, iOS app, and Web SDK,\u201d Olowe explains.\n\nLendsqr has painstakingly assembled a team of engineers and data experts with experience in Nigeria\u2019s credit and tech space. However, there are players with similar value offerings.\n\nIn 2020, Evolve Credit went live as a marketplace for borrowers to review and choose the best lenders to borrow from. Since its launch, it has evolved into a platform offering a cloud-based solution for would-be lenders. It claims to help them set up in 24 hours.\n\nIndicina\u2019s product, Originate, helps lenders digitise identity verification, credit decision/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\n\nThough initially offering similar features to the other two, Creditclan, has pivoted to aid the process for buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies, a growing sensation in the eCommerce space.\n\nInterestingly, Lendsqr claims its customers can start lending in five mins with already configured products and domain names.\n\n\u201cOur cost of set up and user onboarding is as cheap as free (\u20a60). Our decision engine is very smart with over 300 data variables available for lenders to tweak as they wish, yet we provide them with simple start configurations, to begin with,\u201d Olowe submits.\n\nContinuing, he says, \u201cOur collections and recovery is relentless; it hunts down bad borrowers until the very end. We have one of the largest blacklists to protect lenders from predatory borrowers and chronic debtors.\n\n\u201cFor our APIs, unlike the credit bureau and others, we only charge if and only if it finds data.\u201d\n\nSolutions can be tearful\n\nLendsqr\u2019s aggressive approach certainly comes at a cost. Few people can boast of not tearing up when peeling an onion or trying to build a startup\n\nIf Lendsqr has zero costs for setup and user onboarding, how does it make money? The answer seemingly lies in playing an Amazon-esque long game.\n\n\u201cThe core of our revenue model is charging a fee when we help lenders collect their loans. And there is an alignment \u2014 we don\u2019t charge them before \u2014 our bread isn\u2019t buttered before theirs,\u201d Olowe insists.\n\nConsidering this, any keen observer can guess Lendsqr will earnestly chase growth and try to corner the lending market. So far, it is growing an enviable user base.\n\nThe CEO claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\n\u201cLendsqr will break even after two years. We follow the model of Amazon \u2014 amazing technology and data play at basement level pricing,\u201d Olowe maintains, and for emphasis, adds Jeff Bezos\u2019 famous words, \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen building products for the African market, its peculiarities have to be addressed. For instance, the challenges involved with building a lending infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe cost of underwriting is high in Africa, which puts lenders in a bind. The technology is too expensive to build. Or the cost of data (Credit bureau and statement) is so expensive it is ruinous to small ticket loans.\u201d\n\nOlowe and his team at Lendsqr have had to draw on their wealth of experience and network to navigate the space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to engage with different data providers, credit bureaus, and others. We successfully argued cases for cheaper and scalable lending with the likes of CRC and Mono, who are partners in this journey.\u201d\n\nThese were just some of the wins, though, as Lendsqr had to walk away from some data providers with unnecessarily high usage costs.\n\nThe rewards at the end\n\nWhen eating a well-prepared meal, few people remember the tear-filled eyes of the onion-slicing cook. The same applies to the founder of a unicorn. For a financial sector replete with lending-averse financial institutions, Olowe is adamant that Lendsqr is tailored to match the market\u2019s reality.\n\n\u201cWe are a scale company. We understand that the categories of lenders we are serving are super sensitive about pricing, and we offer propositions that are unmatched in value anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Olowe, Lendsqr is using its scale to pass on cost savings to the lenders, which invariably leads to cheaper loans for Africans and Nigerians.\n\nSo far, Lendsqr\u2019s approach has won the hearts of investors as it has closed an undisclosed pre-seed round. On the strength of this, Lendsqr has some major upgrades in sight.\n\n\u201cIn four months, our lenders would have access to native mobile SDKs that allow them to lend even to the mass market, using their phone data for free instead of paying over $0.5 (\u20a6250) as offered by many lendtech providers.\u201d\n\nThe startup also plans to hit customers at their point of need by targeting BNPL players across different sectors.\n\nBeyond technology, it also plans to connect lenders with capital providers to help them scale their lending.\n\nOlowe encapsulates Lendsqr\u2019s immediate vision with the following words:\n\n\u201cWithin 18 months, 1 in 4 consumer credit in Nigeria would either be originated by lenders on Lendsqr or Lendsqr would have provided data comfort to other lenders.\u201d\n\nTo understand the full impact of Lendsqr\u2019s development, one only needs to look at the recent funding trends for BNPL startups, credit-led neobanks, and innovative companies like Indicina and Evolve Credit playing in the space. All things being equal, Africa\u2019s lending scene looks set to explode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

They gain a better understanding of business processes and meet individuals with similar interests. It wasn\u2019t different this time, and the event kicked off by 5:15 p.m.\n\nProviding credit financing for Africans\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the first entrepreneur \u2014 Dayo Oyekanmi \u2014 stepped up to pitch his startup \u2014 Harmony. Harmony plans to play in the increasingly competitive buy now, pay later industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyekanmi shared that it plans to focus on providing credit financing for its consumers. Rather than hold inventory, the startup will assess data provided by a prospective customer to determine how much credit they can extend. Currently running its private beta, the startup also plans to issue credit cards that will be used to shop at partner merchants.\n\nEmergency responses for Nigerians\n\nThe second person to pitch was Oluwafemi Adeleke. His startup, Siara, plans to provide emergency response and security services for Nigerians using a community model. Unlike Harmony, Adeleke disclosed that Siara had not launched but was still in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nProviding feedback to entrepreneurs is an integral part of Pitch Friday. Occasionally, entrepreneurs whose business models are still unclear get more clarity from questions asked by the audience.\n\nAfter the two entrepreneurs had pitched, they got questions and feedback from a highly engaged audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Oyekanmi, many of the questions revolved around the risk management and profitability of the business. He explained that the startup uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess a customer\u2019s capability to repay a loan while clarifying that it intends to focus on credit financing.\n\nWith Siara appearing to be offering too many services, the audience grilled Adeleke on the startup\u2019s core proposition.\n\nWhen the event ended at 6:30 p.m., participants hung around to meet each other. April\u2019s edition of Pitch Friday will be held on Friday, April 8, 2022, and you can register to pitch your startup or join the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "The global fertiliser industry is reeling from impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, but for Nigerian farmers, fears of disruptions to the supply chain are being allayed with the Dangote Fertiliser Plant, being inaugurated today.\n\nThe phase one of the plant was estimated to cost $2.5 billion and is expected to manufacture three million metric tonnes per annum of urea.\n\nThe capacity is to be expanded to produce multi-grades of fertilisers to meet soil, crop and climate specific requirements for the African continent, according to a project fact sheet shared with BusinessDay and quoted in a July 2020 report.\n\nFarmers and agric industry players interviewed at the time, two years ago, were optimistic it would be a game-changer when it started operations.\n\nIn recent interviews ahead of the inauguration, the optimism remains, except with a bit of caution now as pricing takes priority.\n\n\u201cI am still optimistic about it if Dangote is passionate about the country,\u201d said Africanfarmer Mogaji, chairman, Agric & Agro-Allied Group, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThe optimism he expressed in a recent interview builds on his previous position that the Dangote plant \u201cwill be a game-changer in the agric space when it takes off.\u201d\n\nGideon Negedu, executive secretary, Fertilizer Producers and Suppliers Association of Nigeria, told BusinessDay that the fertiliser plant had been operating since last year, and the industry had been better for it.\n\nA 50kg bag of urea fertiliser currently retails around N17,000 as prices continue to increase from N11,000 last year. Several factors have pushed prices up, and even when Dangote fertilisers hit the market earlier, pricing was at par.\n\nRead also: Five challenges that will impact Nigeria\u2019s 2022 agric output\n\nHowever, BusinessDay learnt it helped to offset gaps that would have been created by a major local producer that preferred to export instead. The Dangote plant plans to export too, but farmers expect the local market to benefit significantly.\n\n\u201cThree million metric tonnes will flood the market with urea if the price will be affordable,\u201d said Kabir Ibrahim, president of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN). \u201cWhen it starts full production, we hope the market is impacted.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the West African Fertiliser Association put fertiliser consumption in Nigeria at 1.4 million metric tonnes, whereas the country has an estimated demand of six million metric tonnes, according to a presentation by Negedu, retrieved online by BusinessDay.\n\nFarm output in Nigeria ranks poorly for most crops, and while output is not entirely due to fertiliser, its usage or non-usage contributes significantly to farm productivity. Generally, fertiliser usage in Nigeria is low, attributed to many factors but prominently, cost of acquisition.\n\nIn June 2006, part of the resolutions adopted by the African Union Special Summit of the Heads of State and Government in the famed \u2018Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for the African Green Revolution\u2019 sought to increase fertiliser usage across the continent from 8 kilograms to 50 kilograms of nutrients per hectare by 2015. It is presently estimated that Nigeria only uses about 23kg (less than 50 percent of this target).\n\nSince initial announcements that the Dangote Fertiliser Plant will come on stream (in 2021), farmers have been hoping that their days of struggling with expensive and inadequate supply of fertilisers, which at times also come at inferior qualities, would finally be over. For the Dangote fertiliser to make the desired impact, however, pricing remains key for farmers.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t change anything,\u201d said Olufemi Abioye, who heads the Igangan Agropark Investors Association, with 39,000 hectares under Oyo state. Considering the current prices for fertilisers, he thinks it will take nothing short of a miracle for the Dangote fertiliser to make a difference.\n\n\u201cRight now, the prices are very much at par, but in terms of increasing supply, yes (this would be an impact),\u201d said Negedu. According to him, it has been a trying time within one to two years to genuinely access the impact of such an investment, given that global prices have also gone up and pressures coming from the backlog of demand due to COVID-19. In terms of availability of the stock, it has increased supply, he emphasised.\n\nAs Mogaji explained, the dynamics affecting the Dangote business like others in Nigeria, particularly logistics, would be reflected in how the fertilisers are eventually sold.\n\nFor AFAN\u2019s Ibrahim, diesel is now about N800 per litre, which means to get the fertiliser from the plant in Lagos to Katsina (where he is based, for instance) could push transport cost alone to about N1 million.\n\nWhen this is factored into the price of the fertiliser, it could then go up to about N20,000 per bag, he said.\n\n\u201cLet us wait for the formal commissioning, see what it has to bring out and what the market forces determine in the future,\u201d said Ibrahim.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has increased its total borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to N18.16 trillion, more than 40 percent of the money supply in the economy, according to official data collated by BusinessDay.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) disclosed last Thursday that the country\u2019s public debt stock increased by N6.64 trillion last year to N39.55 trillion in December.\n\nThe N18.16 trillion owed by the Federal Government to the CBN is currently not included in the data on public debt stock, which comprises the debts of the Federal Government, the 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nIts inclusion, which the debt office said it was working on last year, would increase the country\u2019s total debt to over N57 trillion as of December.\n\nCBN loans to the Federal Government through the Ways and Means Advances surged by N4.34 trillion last year to N17.45 trillion in December. The government borrowed N704 billion in January this year, the latest data from the apex bank showed.\n\nWays and Means Advances is a loan facility used by the central bank to finance government in periods of temporary budget shortfalls subject to limits imposed by law.\n\n\u201cIf the central bank keeps financing the government deficit through ways and means advances, it is not healthy for the economy. It is worrying because it adds to the debt stock, which is rising,\u201d Akpan Ekpo, an ex-member of the CBN Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful. At some point some years ago, the CBN stopped ways and means advances. It is very difficult at times for CBN to tell the government \u2018no\u2019 because it is a banker to the government. But there are times when they need to say, \u2018Let us have some rethink as to the rising ways and means advances.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the professor of economics, the country already has what is called \u2018fiscal dominance,\u2019 which is affecting inflation.\n\nThe CBN data revealed that net claims on the central government jumped to N10.03 trillion in January 2022 from N8.56 trillion in December 2020.\n\nClaims on the central government soared to N20.96 trillion in January 2022 from N16.47 trillion in December 2020, while liabilities to the central government surged to N10.93 trillion from N7.92 trillion.\n\nIn May 2015, when President Muhammadu Buhari came to power, the total borrowing from the CBN was N789.67 billion, claims on the central bank were N1.48 trillion and liabilities to the central government were N2.01 trillion.\n\n\u201cOur economy is in a stagflation phase; we have a high unemployment rate of over 30 percent, we have inflation at double-digit and rising again, and we have sluggish GDP growth. So, ways and means advances will compound the problem,\u201d Ekpo said.\n\nAccording to Section 38 of the CBN Act, 2007, the total amount of such advances outstanding shall not at any time exceed five percent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAll advances shall be repaid as soon as possible and shall, in any event, be repayable by the end of the Federal Government financial year in which they are granted and if such advances remain unpaid at the end of the year, the power of the bank to grant such further advances in any subsequent year shall not be exercisable, unless the outstanding advances have been repaid,\u201d it says.\n\nRead also: How CBN disbursed N928bn under Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme\n\nThe last time the Federal Government made a repayment was in May 2017, and its debt to the CBN has been growing steadily since then, the bank\u2019s data showed.\n\nThe World Bank, in a report in November last year, noted that the Federal Government\u2019s recourse to CBN\u2019s overdraft facility had repeatedly exceeded the limit of five percent of the previous year\u2019s fiscal revenues.\n\nIt said the government continued to draw on the facility in 2020, with borrowing from the central bank amounting to around 80 percent of the previous year\u2019s fiscal revenues.\n\nIn 2020, the government turned to the apex bank for a record N4.9 trillion to plug its fiscal financing gap amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing its total borrowing from the CBN to N13.11 trillion at the end of that year.\n\n\u201cN18 trillion is significant. It is about 40 percent of the money supply,\u201d Bismarck Rewane, MD/CEO of Financial Derivatives Company Ltd, said.\n\nMoney supply (M2) rose to N44.46 trillion as of January 2022 from N37.74 trillion a year earlier, according to the CBN.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government was to say it cannot borrow from the central bank today, and therefore put N18 trillion worth of securities into the market, interest rates will spike,\u201d Rewane, a member of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, told BusinessDay.\n\nHe said the reason for the high level of ways and means advances was that the government was issuing Treasury bills at what he described as \u201cartificially depressed interest rates.\u201d\n\nThe financial expert said, \u201cWhen you have interest rates that are so far below the rate of inflation, it results in distortion. Rational investors are saying that it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to buy government paper, and it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t buy government paper that we are having high ways and means advances.\n\n\u201cThe interest rate structure is not efficient. Move your interest rate as close as possible, not immediately \u2013 but just start moving it, towards the level of the inflation rate.\u201d\n\nMoney supply expands, heightens inflation risk\n\nNigeria saw its money stock rise by more than 13 percent last year, caused partly by the increased borrowing by the Federal Government from the central bank.\n\nThe broad money supply (M3) in the country stood at N43.82 trillion in December 2021, up from N38.63 trillion a year earlier, according to the CBN. It rose to N44.56 trillion in January this year.\n\nThe money supply growth spiked in November and December, with growth rates of 10.10 percent and 13.77 percent respectively exceeding the provisional annual benchmark of 9.64 percent.\n\nRobert Asogwa, a member of the MPC, highlighted \u201cthree worrisome indicators\u201d at their meeting in January, describing the inflationary rise in December, the surge in M3, and the persistent debt build-up as \u201ckey issues of policy concern.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the M3 jumped from 4.72 percent on a month-on-month basis at the end of September to 7.37 percent in October.\n\n\u201cCBN staff report shows that this growth was largely driven by increases in central bank\u2019s claims on the Federal Government and other sectors,\u201d Asogwa said. \u201cThe key concern is that such significant monthly increases in broad money may sooner than later be adding to domestic inflationary pressures and this has to be closely watched.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank, IMF raise concerns\n\nAccording to the World Bank, if Ways and Means financing from CBN and AMCON debt are included in the public debt, short-term debt vulnerabilities are enhanced, raising more immediate concerns about debt sustainability.\n\nDebts of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) guaranteed by the Federal Government are reported in DMO\u2019s accounts as contingent liabilities. The corporation was set up in 2010 to take on bad debts and rescue the nation\u2019s banking industry from collapse.\n\nThe World Bank said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s debt remains sustainable, albeit vulnerable and costly, especially due to large and growing financing from the Central Bank of Nigeria. While currently the debt stock of 27 percent of GDP is considered sustainable, any macro-fiscal shock can push debt to unsustainable levels.\n\n\u201cFrom a financial management perspective, using the overdraft facility to finance the government deficit is costly. The CBN charges an interest rate of the MPR plus 300 basis points, considerably exceeding current T-bill and T-bond interest rates.\u201d\n\nThe multilateral lender said without appropriate measures to reduce Ways and Means financing and restructure the existing stock of federal arrears to the CBN, the rising cost of debt servicing would continue to constrain the government\u2019s already limited fiscal space, and make government planning and budgeting difficult and unrealistic.\n\nIn February this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlighted the urgency of fiscal consolidation to create policy space and reduce debt sustainability risks in Nigeria, calling for significant domestic revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe Washington-based fund said last year that central bank financing of budget deficit should be phased out in order to reduce inflation, adding, \u201cThe increasing reliance on CBN overdrafts has come with negative consequences.\u201d\n\nEfforts to securitise FG\u2019s debt still underway\n\nIn a letter of intent to the IMF regarding Nigeria\u2019s request for emergency financial assistance of $3.4bn in 2020, Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, and Godwin Emefiele, CBN governor, said the recourse to central bank financing would be eliminated by 2025.\n\nThey added that the existing stock of overdrafts held at the CBN would also be securitised.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure that has been done. That could have been a better way of postponing the evil day because when you securitise, it doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t pay later. It is just that in the short and medium term, you minimise the risk,\u201d Ekpo said.\n\nBloomberg reported on February 16, 2021 that the Federal Government had set the terms for the conversion of its stock of central bank overdrafts into long-term notes in a bid to create transparency around its dependence on that source of funding.\n\nPatience Oniha, director-general of DMO, was quoted as saying at the time that the N10 trillion debt would be exchanged for 30-year notes issued to the central bank, adding that the agreement on timing for the conversion needed to be finalised to get the required approval from the cabinet, at the earliest in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nOniha said in October last year that the country\u2019s public debt-to-GDP ratio was increased from 25 percent to 40 percent to accommodate other existing debts, including the ways and means advances as well as promissory notes being issued by the government.\n\n\u201cWe are about 22 percent in June 2021. But we do recognise that some things are happening that should be part of debt stock. One of them is the ways and means advances. So, you have to create space for it; you don\u2019t have to wait until you securitise it,\u201d she said at the Nigerian Economic Summit in Abuja.\n\nAccording to her, the ways and means advances have to go through a process for it to be included in the public debt stock.\n\n\u201cSo, we are going through that process of restructuring it, and once it is restructured and it passes through the Federal Executive Council and the National Assembly, it will be added to the public debt stock. The CBN Act allows it to lend to the Federal Government; it is just how much it should lend that is the issue,\u201d she said.\n\nOniha, in an interview with journalists last Thursday, spoke on the process of converting the CBN overdrafts to bonds.\n\n\u201cThe process of converting the CBN Ways and Means, which is the government\u2019s overdraft at the Central Bank of Nigeria, into long tenor bonds is still ongoing, and related parties, that is, the monetary and fiscal authorities, are still in discussions,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "When Ayomide Ajayi, a 45-year-old teacher and mother of four, newly moved to Irawo \u2013 a suburb along Ikorodu road in Lagos, she didn\u2019t realise just how much the lack of potable water in the community would affect her and her family.\n\nA year later, Ajayi realised that the lack of clean water in the community was plaguing her life daily.\n\nIrawo \u2013 a flood-prone area where she resides \u2013 lies north-east of Lagos and close to tributaries linked from the Ogun-Osun River Basin. The high content of iron III oxide (Fe2O3) and saltwater intrusion into the groundwater table have made portable water a scarce and precious commodity in the community.\n\n\u201cWe cannot drink the water here and can\u2019t wash our clothes with it. The iron content is too high,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the rainy season, the lack of drinking water is somewhat abated, as Ajayi, like many others in the community, collects rain water in plastic containers to drink and cook. But during the dry season, the situation is severe as the water in the community becomes darker and scarier.\n\nThe lack of potable water in Lagos \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub, which is home to roughly 22 million people \u2013 is a challenge facing not only poor communities but also the middle-class and highbrow areas of the megacity.\n\nWhen Chuks Okafor, a bank manager in one of the top banks in the country, was posted to Lagos from Benin, he was excited after renting an apartment in Lekki Phase 2.\n\nFilled with the excitement of having an apartment in an expensive estate, Okafor switched on his sink tap to drink water just like he usually did while he was in Benin but he was disappointed.\n\nThe water coming out of the tap was coloured and high in salinity. \u201cI was highly disappointed. I couldn\u2019t drink the water coming out from the tap,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI thought living in a highbrow area like Lekki means I would not be facing a water problem,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite having some of the most expensive real estates in the state, Lekki \u2013 located in the south-east of Lagos, with Victoria Island and Ikoyi districts to its west, the Atlantic Ocean to its south, Lagos Lagoon to its north, and Lekki Lagoon to its east \u2013 has a water problem.\n\nResidents of Lekki and its environs depend largely on boreholes as a source of water supply, which, in most cases, is not good for drinking because it is contaminated due to the shallow water table of the area and the saltwater intrusion into the underground water.\n\n\u201cDue to the proximity of Lagos to the Atlantic Ocean, the general population is faced with problems of freshwater abstraction from the subsurface,\u201d Obunadike Ebuka, a lecturer at the Department of Hydrogeology, Technische Universitat Bergeakademie, said in a study.\n\nRead also: Enugu residents decry 40% increase in sachet water price\n\nAlthough \u2018access to safe and affordable drinking water for all\u2019 is goal 6 of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, many communities with a water problem in Nigeria\u2019s megacity are far from the distribution network that provides clean water to homes.\n\n\u201cThe water infrastructure of Lagos State is not developing at a fast pace with the population, and this has left many homes without potable water,\u201d said Enovwo Odejegba, a lecturer at the Department of Water Resources Management and Agrometeorology, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cMost communities without clean water are far away from the water distribution network. So, they are left to provide water for themselves.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the contamination of the groundwater in these communities is caused by a combination of saline intrusion, flooding, and improper waste disposal that impacts the quality of the groundwater water.\n\nAccording to WaterAid Nigeria, three in 10 Nigerians do not have clean water close to their homes, putting them under constant threat from waterborne diseases like cholera.\n\nClean water for a price\n\nThe water problem in Irawo, Owode-Onirin, Lekki Phase 2, Ajah, Ijegun-Egba in Sattelite Town, and other communities in Lagos has turned water into a commodity.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot buying water for drinking and cooking. I spend an average of N12,000 monthly buying water from tanker drivers and sachet water producers,\u201d Ajayi said. This amount is 20 percent of her N60,000 monthly income as a teacher.\n\nSimilarly, Okafor spends N21,000 monthly buying water from tanker drivers for the running of his Lekki home. \u201cWe use three tanks monthly and each costs N7,000,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cost of getting clean water in these communities has doubled in recent weeks owing to the recent surge in diesel prices.\n\nTanker drivers delivering water to such communities are spending more on diesel as the price of fuel soared by almost 233 percent in one year to N750-800 per litre from N220-N240 in March last year.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel is a result of the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cThe cost for clean water is increasing daily because of the recent spike in diesel prices,\u201d said Charles Dike, a trader of electronics who resides in Ijegun-Egba in Satellite town, whose community also faces a similar water problem.\n\nHe spends N4,000 weekly on the water for cooking and bathing but the cost has increased to N6,000 in recent days. \u201cThe water situation here is tiring and expensive,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to a 2021 United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, only 22 percent (44 million) of Nigerians have access to safely managed drinking water services.\n\n\u201cThe financial and economic impact on the people in communities without potable water is huge and most of them are poor,\u201d said Odejegba.\n\nClimate change worsening the situation\n\nClimate change is one of the most disruptive challenges Nigeria is currently facing. Its negative impacts are visible. Floods and drought are the common impacts of climate change on water availability.\n\n\u201cFlooding also impacts the quality of groundwater, especially in the unconfined aquifer with porous overburden characterised by high hydraulic conductivities offering little or no attenuation to contaminants coming from polluted runoff water from the flooded river and lagoons,\u201d said Desmond Majekodunmi, an environmentalist.\n\nWaterAid Nigeria said in a recent report that changing climate was making life harder for the world\u2019s poorest people already struggling to get clean water.\n\nAccording to the report, more frequent and extreme flooding is polluting fragile water sources and longer droughts drying them up.",

So, the one (pupil) that wants to go to TVET can go to.\n\n\u201cIf they go to TVET, that doesn\u2019t mean that is where their education stops; they can decide on to read medicine; they can decide on to go to Polytechnic.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We just want to ensure the basic education as stipulated by the 2004 UBE Act is first 10 years of education is free and compulsory.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time a student is graduating from JSS 3, we want them not only to be literate and numerate, we also want them to be skilled.\n\n\u201cSo, by the time we are able to do that, Edo is going to be far ahead of everybody else,\u201d she said.\n\nThe commissioner added that the state was in the process of formalising the informal skilled sector in the state.\n\nShe noted that going forward, the state would ensure that all electricians, plumbers, welders and tailors among other artisans operating in the state, work in line with the guidelines of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\n\u201cSo, for our informal apprenticeship sector, we want to link that with our adult education system.\n\n\u201cIf you are already an artisan; a master craftsperson, but you don\u2019t know how to read, we can send you to our adult education school; it is free. That is for those who are already established.\n\n\u201cFor new apprenticeship that will be coming into the system, we are now going to say you must know how to read and write,\u201d said the commissioner.\n\nThis mainstreaming of skilled acquisition, technical and vocational studies, she explained would be extended to schools for Special Needs in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, mainstreaming skilled acquisition, technical and vocational is not just in our regular schools, the governor has mandated that we should extend to our Special Needs schools.\n\n\u201cWe want to train the next generation of differently able learners to be self sufficient.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to raise the next generation of differently able people who grow up and we acculturate them to become beggars.\n\n\u201cThe world has advanced to the stage that almost everybody can be self sufficient, if they put their minds to it,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "With no end appearing to be in sight to the debilitating fuel crisis in the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stepped forward to intervene in the matter, raising hopaces of a quick resolution.\n\nThe CBN bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, who revealed this move yesterday at the month\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN, said the bank would take measures to mitigate the impact of the fuel crisis on the Nigerian economy by engaging with key government agencies.\n\nThe apex bank is looking to help improve the supply and distribution of the commodity across the nation.\n\nThis is coming two months after the importation of the off-spec petrol which plunged the country into fuel scarcity of massive proportions. The Russia-Ukraine war has also resulted in supply shortage for import-dependent countries like Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CBN governor said the bank would first be engaging with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards finding ways to end the lingering petrol scarcity, which had pushed up the price of petrol to between N165 and N230 per litre, while diesel sells for between N700 and 800/litre in the last eight weeks.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the substantial upward push to price levels continued to be influenced by supply-side factors such as the scarcity of PMS, persisting insecurity and backlash from the Russia-Ukraine war. These require a careful and focused policy intervention to address and resolve.\n\nHe expressed belief that a reduction in the arbitrary prices of petrol and diesel would automatically result in gradual moderation in prices of the products, which would ultimately result in the moderation in the prices of other products whose prices would have gone up as a result of the arbitrary increase in the prices of these items.\n\n\u201cIf these actions are taken, we are positive that inflation will come down,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN governor further stated that product scarcity was responsible for the arbitrary increase in the prices of diesel and petrol across the country. He expressed concern that the increase in energy prices was a major cause of the rise in headline inflation that rose to 15.7 per cent in February.\n\nThis is as NNPC Ltd. has dismissed a report that it had increased prices of petrol at the depots. In a statement shared via its social media channels, it advised the public and relevant stakeholders to disregard the information.\n\n\u201cIt is fake news obviously concocted to cause confusion and to undermine the progressive drive of the NNPC to restore normalcy to the market,\u201d it said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn electricity, Emefiele said the apex bank would also partner with power sector regulators to address the challenges still affecting stable power supply in Nigeria. He said the recent nationwide blackout as a result of collapse of the national grid had also increased the demand for diesel to power private generators, and, by implication, increased demand in the already scarce product.\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging with the power minister, NBET and NERC to see whatever we can do to support them,\u201d the CBN governor stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, the CBN had disbursed over N1.3 trillion in the last five years to support both the power generating and distribution companies. The facility was to improve capacity of the power sector to meet national demand and for the system to continue to operate.\n\nOn the call by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the CBN to scale back its intervention schemes, Emefiele said the apex bank was simply deploying home grown solutions through its development finance mandate to support the fiscal arm of the government by providing support facilities to businesses, individuals and households.",

          "text": "Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), the Federal Ministry of Environment and the British High Commission have jointly launched an updated version of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 (NECAL 2050) to tackle climate change.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the British High Commission in Abuja, this makes Nigeria the first country in Africa to perform such feat, stressing that it is an energy and emissions model to assist Nigeria in achieving its climate goals.\n\nPresent at the event in Abuja yesterday were Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria; Sharon Ikeazor, Minister of State for Environment; Pauline Tallen, Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development; Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Prof. Eli. Jidere Bala, the director-general/ CEO Energy Commission of Nigeria, and various stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe update, the first in Africa, was delivered under the UK Government\u2019s international 2050 Calculator programme, which is funded by the UK\u2019s International Climate Finance, and was led by global engineering, management and development consultancy Mott MacDonald, and a consortium which includes Imperial College, Climact and Ricardo,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAt the event minister of science, technology and innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said, \u201cThis is an energy planning tool that enables choices in energy development pathway to be examined, along with its environmental consequences. The NECAL2050 model should form part of our national energy planning tools. This will be used in planning energy needs for Nigeria\u2019s Vision 2050 and beyond. This will reflect Nigeria\u2019s commitment to cleaner and more sustainable energy utilisation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe present version of the NECAL 2050 Calculator \u2013 a tool that allows users to trial different options for reducing emissions at a faster rate and to build a pathway that meets long-term emission targets to 2050 \u2013 is designed to help industries and the energy sector to set their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as to identify realistic solutions which support the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s climate commitments, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nThe British high commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing in her remarks said, \u201cThe launch of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 further strengthens bilateral collaboration between the UK and Nigeria on the clean energy transition. Nigeria\u2019s energy sector accounts for 60 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions and the sector is also key to the delivery of Nigeria\u2019s many development priorities; it is therefore critical to understand the options that are available to reduce emissions while matching energy supply and demand.\n\n\u201cI look forward to seeing the NECAL2050 tool supporting different sectors of government to design and deliver high-quality policies that enhance the conditions for strong governance, growth, job creation and poverty reduction.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso, minister of state for environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said, \u201cThe ministry as the national coordinating body of climate activities will leverage on this tool for policy and decision making for the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s long-term strategy for climate change under the Paris Agreement, as well as identify realistic solutions towards supporting the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s NDCs.\u201d",
          "summary": "Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), the Federal Ministry of Environment and the British High Commission have jointly launched an updated version of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 (NECAL 2050) to tackle climate change.\nJidere Bala, the director-general/ CEO Energy Commission of Nigeria, and various stakeholders.\nAt the event minister of science, technology and innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said, \u201cThis is an energy planning tool that enables choices in energy development pathway to be examined, along with its environmental consequences.\nThis will be used in planning energy needs for Nigeria\u2019s Vision 2050 and beyond.\nThe British high commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing in her remarks said, \u201cThe launch of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 further strengthens bilateral collaboration between the UK and Nigeria on the clean energy transition.",

          "text": "Chinese recovery teams on Tuesday picked through the debris of a crashed China Eastern jet after it inexplicably plummeted from the sky into a mountainside with 132 people on board.\n\nHopes of finding any survivors had all but vanished a day after the Boeing 737-800 passenger jet nosedived into the mountain \u2014 likely making it China\u2019s deadliest air crash in nearly three decades.\n\nQuestions mounted over the cause of the crash, which saw the stricken jet drop 20,000 feet (6,096 metres) in just over a minute before plunging into rugged terrain in southern China on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe airline has acknowledged that some aboard the jet, which was travelling from the city of Kunming to the southern hub of Guangzhou, had died, but there has been no official confirmation of the number of dead.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping quickly called for a full probe following the crash as search teams armed with drones descended upon the site in a forested, rural area of Guangxi province.\n\nOn Tuesday, scorch marks were visible from the crash and resulting fire, rescue workers told AFP, with one speculating that passengers had been \u201ctotally incinerated\u201d from the intensity of the blaze.\n\nA villager near the sprawling crash site, giving only his surname Ou, recounted hearing a \u201csound like thunder\u201d followed by a blaze that blistered the surrounding hills.\n\nState media showed uniformed search teams clambering over upturned earth, blasted trees and scattered debris, including a section of plane bearing the carrier\u2019s blue and red livery.\n\nA torn wallet and a burned camera lens were among the eviscerated possessions captured on video by a reporter from the state-run People\u2019s Daily who was able to enter the crash site.\n\nBut AFP journalists were blocked at a hillside checkpoint by a group of men identifying themselves as Communist Party members who said they had \u201corders from above\u201d to prevent access.\n\nThe disaster occurred after a high-speed vertical nosedive, according to a video carried by Chinese media. AFP could not immediately verify the video\u2019s authenticity.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Miss you forever\u2019 \u2013\n\nFlight MU5735, which took off from Kunming shortly after 1:00 pm (0500 GMT), lost contact over Wuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region, according to China\u2019s aviation authority.\n\nThe foreign ministry said Tuesday they believed all passengers on board were Chinese nationals.\n\nIn Guangzhou airport, staff assisted loved ones of the 123 passengers and nine crew members aboard the plane, which stopped sending any flight information after dropping a total of 26,000 feet in altitude in just three minutes.\n\nRelatives and friends of those onboard endured a grim wait for news.\n\nA user on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like platform, wrote that he was a friend of a crew member on the crashed plane.\n\n\u201cI will miss you forever,\u201d he wrote, describing the \u201centhusiasm\u201d his friend took to his new job this year.\n\nThe disaster prompted an unusually swift public reaction from Xi, who said he was \u201cshocked\u201d and called for \u201cabsolute safety\u201d in air travel.\n\nState media said Vice Premier Liu He, a powerful official close to Xi who usually deals with economic matters, had been dispatched to the area to oversee rescue and investigation work.\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board said it had named a senior investigator as a representative to the probe, and that officials from Boeing, General Electric and the Federal Aviation Administration would be technical advisers.\n\nFlight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 feet to 7,850 feet in just over a minute.\n\nAfter a brief upswing, it plunged to 3,225 feet, the tracker said.\n\nJean-Paul Troadec, former director of France\u2019s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, told AFP it was \u201cfar too early\u201d to draw conclusions, but said the FlightRadar data pattern was \u201cvery unusual\u201d.\n\nChina had enjoyed an enviable air safety record in recent years, despite a huge boom in travel.\n\nChinese media reported that the airline will now ground all the 737-800 jets.\n\nThe deadliest Chinese commercial flight accident was a China Northwest Airlines crash in 1994 that killed all 160 onboard.",

          "text": "Civilians making the dangerous escape from Ukraine\u2019s embattled southern port hub of Mariupol described fleeing through street-to-street gun battles and past unburied corpses as a steady Russian bombardment tried to pound the city into submission.\n\nWhile Russian forces carried on with the siege after the city\u2019s defenders refused demands to surrender, the Kremlin\u2019s ground offensives in other parts of the country were advancing slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians.\n\nThe Ukrainian army said early Tuesday that it had forced Russian troops out of a strategically important Kyiv suburb following a fierce battle. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway to the west and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian forces battlinBut Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian forces battling toward Kyiv were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia\u2019s military invaded late last month.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine\u2019s cities and the civilians living there, killing uncounted numbers and sending millions fleeing.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military\u2019s assessment, said Russia had increased air sorties over the past two days, carrying out as many as 300 in the past 24 hours, and has fired more than 1,100 missiles into Ukraine since the invasion began.\n\nIn a video address Monday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed those who have fought back against Russia.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to organize resistance,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cResistance for Ukrainians is part of their soul.\u201d\n\nIn Mariupol, with communications crippled, movement restricted and many residents in hiding, the fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theater that was blown apart four days earlier was unclear. More than 1,300 people were believed to be sheltering in the theater, and 400 were estimated to have been in the art school.\n\nPerched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol has been a key target that has been besieged for more than three weeks and has seen some of the worst suffering of the war.\n\nBut no clear, independent picture emerged of how close its capture might be. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex.\n\nRussia for now controls the land corridor from Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014, and is blocking Ukraine\u2019s access to the Sea of Azov, the ministry said.\n\n\u201cNobody can tell from the outside if it really is on the verge of being taken,\u201d said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the British think tank Chatham House.\n\nOver the weekend, Moscow had offered safe passage out of Mariupol \u2014 one corridor leading east to Russia, another going west to other parts of Ukraine \u2014 in return for the city\u2019s surrender before daybreak Monday. Ukraine flatly rejected the offer well before the deadline.\n\nMariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. There has been no official estimate since then, but the number is feared to be far higher after six more days of bombardment.\n\nFor those who remain, conditions have become brutal. The assault has cut off Mariupol\u2019s electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world, plunging residents into a fight for survival. Fresh commercial satellite images showed smoke rising from buildings newly hit by Russian artillery.\n\nMariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting.\n\nThose who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city.\n\n\u201cThere are no buildings there anymore,\u201d said 77-year-old Maria Fiodorova, who crossed the border to Poland on Monday after five days of travel.\n\nOlga Nikitina, who fled Mariupol for the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where she arrived Sunday, said gunfire blew out her windows, and her apartment dropped below freezing.\n\n\u201cBattles took place over every street. Every house became a target,\u201d she said.\n\nA long line of vehicles stood on a road in Bezimenne as Mariupol residents sought shelter at a temporary camp set up by Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region. An estimated 5,000 people from Mariupol have taken refuge in the camp. Many arrived in cars with signs that said \u201cchildren\u201d in Russian.\n\nA woman who gave her name as Yulia said she and her family sought shelter in Bezimenne after a bombing destroyed six houses behind her home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we got in the car, at our own risk, and left in 15 minutes because everything is destroyed there, dead bodies are lying around,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t let us pass through everywhere \u2014 there are shootings.\u201d\n\nIn all, more than 8,000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3,000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.\n\nRussian shelling of a corridor wounded four children on a route leading out of Mariupol, Zelenskyy said.\n\nElsewhere, Britain\u2019s defense ministry said Ukrainian resistance has kept the bulk of Moscow\u2019s forces more than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the center of Kyiv, but the capital \u201cremains Russia\u2019s primary military objective.\u201d\n\nIn the Russian-occupied southern city of Kherson on Monday, Russian forces shot into the air and fired stun grenades at protestors who were chanting \u201cGo home!\u201d Kherson early this month became the first major city to fall to Russia\u2019s offensive.\n\nUkrainian authorities also said Russia shelled a chemical plant outside the eastern city of Sumy, sending toxic ammonia leaking from a 50-ton tank, and hit a military training base in the Rivne region of western Ukraine with cruise missiles.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion has driven nearly 3.5 million people from Ukraine, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has confirmed over 900 civilian deaths but said the real toll is probably much higher. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands.\n\nTalks between Russia and Ukraine have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine disarm and declare itself neutral. Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any NATO bid by Ukraine in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine\u2019s security.\n\nZelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and the regions of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time, after a cease-fire and steps toward security guarantees.\n\n___\n\nAP",

          "text": "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has appealed to the federal and state governments to protect industries from the erratic power supply and hike in price of diesel across the country.\n\nThe Chairman Kwara/Kogi branch of MAN, Bioku Rahmon, stated this on Monday in a statement. He called for expedited rescue of players and investors from the imminent orgy of unemployment and mass closure of companies that is imminent due to the energy crisis. He expressed concern that the manufacturing industry was yet to fully recover from the monumental strangulations occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic, while describing the subsisting energy crisis as the exact antithesis of what the industry can\u2019t contain at this time.\n\nHe lamented that electricity generated from the national grid had recorded no improvement and was hampering the activities of MAN. MAN urged the state and federal governments to save the manufacturing sector from imminent collapse, which according to him could be a major catastrophe to the already bad economy.\n\nIt asked that interest rates on industrial loans be reduced by commercial banks, the widening of the foreign exchange windows to industries and a drastic reduction of interest rates as done with the COVID-19 era palliatives to 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cRenewed wave of inflationary pressures further plunged the buying masses into extreme depths of poverty with concomitant erosion of customers\u2019 Disposable Income (DI) and hence culminated in low patronage of our industrial finished products.\n\n\u201cForeign Exchange (FX) scarcity has worsened significantly, even as industry players continue to experience a sharp and growing shrink in the FX windows. This has led to major downturns and stress in the purchase and acquisition of foreign components for production,\u201d MAN said.\n\nIt noted that the epileptic power supply have long resulted to sharp depletion in the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of the manufacturing industry such as capacity utilisation, unsold goods inventory, and sector contribution to National Gross Domestic Product (NGDP) especially since 2020.\n\nRahmon, appealed to government to initiate measures that would address the challenges, noting that last year the unfriendly operating environment and inconsistent business and investment policies of government further paralysed the manufacturing industry leading to weak results in the sector, all of which were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe association urged the Kwara State government to rescue manufacturers by installing a gas-powered energy distribution plant that will exclusively supply power to industries while the CBN should give directives to commercial banks to reduce interest rates on industrial loans.",
