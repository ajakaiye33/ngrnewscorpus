          "title": "Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may expose babies to risk of bow legs, bone deformities \u2013Dietician",
          "text": "Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may expose babies to the risk of bowleg and other bone deformities, says a nutrition expert, Nwabumma Asouzu.\n\nAsouzu, a Registered Dietician-Nutritionist at the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, said adequate vitamin D in pregnancy is critical because the lifetime of bone health of every individual starts from the womb.\n\nBowleg deformity, she said is an incorrect alignment around the knee that can affect people of all ages.\n\nIn an interview with PUNCH Healthwise, the dietician emphasised that maternal nutritional status and dietary intake of calcium and other minerals during pregnancy could have a significant effect on foetal growth and development.\n\nAccording to Asouzu, during pregnancy, the foetus is totally dependent on the mother for acquisition of micronutrients required for bone mineralisation.\n\nShe said, \u201cOur lifetime of bone health starts right at the beginning, with the foetus. To develop bones fit for the demands ahead, the foetus depends on the mother for essential vitamin D and calcium.\n\n\u201cMaternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is a recognised risk factor for rickets and osteomalacia in infancy, which often in most cases cause bow legs and other bone deformities.\n\n\u201cMaximizing bone health begins with maternal health and nutrition, which influences skeletal mass and bone density in the foetus.\n\n\u201cMaternal health and nutrition, as well as the baby\u2019s intake of vitamin D and calcium during breastfeeding and weaning, may have a long-lasting effect on the baby\u2019s future health.\u201d\n\nAsouzu further noted that vitamin D and calcium alongside physical activity play key roles in bone health for both mother and baby.\n\n\u201cThe primary bone-forming minerals are calcium, phosphorus and magnesium (at birth, the infant\u2019s skeleton contains 98 per cent, 80 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, of these minerals).\n\n\u201cQuantitatively, the greatest period of foetal mineral accretion takes place from mid-gestation and is maximal during the third trimester\u201d, she added.\n\nThe dietician stated that after birth, the baby\u2019s bone health will be affected by the amount of vitamin D and calcium in the mother\u2019s breast milk, the availability of vitamin D supplement and the quality of the weaning diet.\n\nThe nutrition expert pointed out that it has become crucial for health professionals and public health specialists to be aware of these issues, adding that nutrition experts need to ensure mothers receive the information they need to help them choose a healthy diet.\n\nGiving insight into causes of bow legs, Asouzu said, \u201cBowlegs often develop in the child\u2019s first year as part of natural growth for no known cause.\n\n\u201cSome babies are born with bowlegs. This can happen as the baby grows and the space inside their mother\u2019s womb gets tighter, causing the leg bones to curve slightly, but in most cases straightens out as they grow and develop.\n\n\u201cThere are certain other conditions that can cause bow leg such as Blount\u2019s disease, metabolic disorders, and bone malformations.\n\n\u201cOthers are vitamin deficiencies (especially vitamin D), calcium deficiency which are attributed to maternal nutritional store and other mineral deficiencies.\u201d\n\nRecommending ways to tackle the health challenge, Asouzu said early in pregnancy, women should be provided with information on the benefits of a healthy diet and practical advice on how to eat healthily throughout pregnancy.\n\nThe dietician listed fatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon as foods that provide vitamin D.\n\nOthers are foods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals.\n\nIn a 2017 Public Health Review article published in BMC journal, titled, \u2018The importance of vitamin D in maternal and child health: a global perspective\u2019, the authors said vitamin D and calcium are essential for adequate health throughout the lifespan.\n\nAccording to them, pregnant women and children however are particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency.\n\nThey noted that vitamin D deficiency continues to be an important global health problem following its devastating health impact.\n\nThe authors called for public health strategies such as food fortification and supplements to address the challenge.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nA total of 170 passengers who boarded the AK-9 train bombed by terrorists on Monday have reunited with their families and loved ones, the Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, disclosed in a release yesterday.\n\nThis is even as the corporation added that in spite of ongoing effort to reach out to families affected by the unfortunate incident, the whereabouts of 21 passengers is unknown.\n\nA release signed by NRC Managing Director, Engr. Fidet Okhiria for the umpteenth time, insisted that 362 passengers were on the manifest and not 970 as circulated in some news blogs.\n\n\u201cThe corporation, in continuation of its concerted effort through repeated calls, has been able to confirm the safety of 170 passengers, while 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to us. The corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of Mr. President to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing.\n\n\u201cYou would recall that on the 28th of March, 2022, suspected bandits attacked the last evening train, AK9 on the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna train service with explosives, leading to the death of some passengers and destruction of the train and track. Because of the level of damage on the track and in honour of those that lost their lives, the Corporation suspended train operations on the affected route.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pedestrian bridges and suicidal Lagosians\n\n\u201cWhile in this mournful mood, it is also important to inform members of the public and the press about the latest development and what the corporation is doing to restore train services. This update has become absolutely necessary so as to prevent the circulation of falsehood or misleading information to the general public.\n\n\u201cFor the records, there were eleven (11) coaches on the train worked by Loco 2502, which is made up of four (4) SPA coaches with 56 sitting capacity per coach and 7 SP coaches with 88 sitting capacity per coach. Thus, the total seat capacity of the train is 840 seats. You may also recall that the Train Manifest contained 362 validated passengers aboard the train.\n\n\u201cThe orporation is also not resting on its oars as she has heavily moved human and material resources to the accident site to make sure that train services resumed without further delays in other to reduce the stress that our passengers are currently going through. In practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast.\n\n\u201cThere is a co-ordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja to the bomb blast site, another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site. I am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. Restoration of track for full resumption of normal train services will continue today 2nd April 2022.\n\n\u201cIt may also interest you to know that arrangements have equally been put in place for increased security along the track and on board the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cOnce again, our hearts go out to the families of those that lost their loved ones and that of those that are still missing. Be assured that the corporation is with you in this challenging time,\u201d the statement read.",

          "text": "The member representing Isu State Constituency in Imo State House of Assembly, Hon. Ngozi Obiefule, has appealed to the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to intervene in the indefinite suspension placed on her by the leadership of state Assembly.\n\nShe cried out for help saying her salary and allowances had been seized since she was sent on suspension last year.\n\nObiefule, elected under the platform of APC, was placed on suspension for what the leadership described as dereliction of duty.\n\nSpeaking to The Nation in Owerri, Obiefule, a ranking member of the House said she and two ranking members of the House were suspended since December 2021 by the leadership of the house for not attending the budget defence.\n\nShe debunked the accusation saying that she attended the defence, but later left the sitting to attend a burial ceremony of Uche Nwosu\u2019s mother when she discovered that there was nothing much to debate during the budget defence because the budget presentation had moved to the Appropriation Committee.\n\n\u201cOn that day I attended that budget defence, submitted my report and left for the burial ceremony of Uche Nwosu\u2019s mother. We are not members of the Appropriation Committee who are in charge of that exercise.\n\n\u201cI have been in this house for the past six years and I am aware that with my years in the office no governor has agreed to any adjustment to any budget that is before the House. So, what we do normally is a veto show and go through the normal rudiment. That\u2019s why sometimes, people don\u2019t really take it seriously because you cannot adjust and readjust the budget that had been done by the executive.\u201d\n\nShe blamed the former Speaker of the House, Paul Emeziem for her predicament.\n\nShe said when the former Speaker first came in, he started suspending members, saying it was unfortunate that in the whole of the Southeast, it is only in the Imo Assembly that such a thing is happening.\n\nShe explained \u201d in the last house, we adopted a 14-day punishment, which was a standing rule for the whole Southeast, the Imo State was the last House that adopted the unified House rule of the five states. It was Paul Emeziem that went to remove the 14-day and changed it to an indefinite suspension.\u201d\n\nShe appealed to party leaders to wade into the matter to rescue her as the party has less than two months to begin its primaries.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the Majority Leader and Adhoc Investigation Committee Chairman on suspended lawmakers, Kanayo Onyemaechi, revealed that none of the lawmakers who were suspended for dereliction of duty and dishonourable behaviour during the 2022 Budget Presentation, had approached his committee.\n\nThe state assembly member representing Owerri West State Constituency made the revelation on Wednesday during Plenary, when the Speaker, Chidozie Ibeh, sought to know if the suspended lawmakers had interfaced with the committee.\n\nThe Speaker expressed surprise that despite the opportunity for the members to state their cases, none of them had utilized the opportunity. He therefore called on the Chairman of the Committee to further extend a formal letter of invitation to them.",

The posts were created by accounts under the name \u201cAdeyinka Grandson\u201d and were reported to police via the online reporting tool www.gov.uk/ACT\n\nShoyemi posted the incriminating video which was seen by Saturday Sun, on his social media page on Friday, October 23, 2020 , warning the Igbo living in the South West to leave within 48 hours and everyone who refuses to leave will be \u2018dead meat\u2019.\n\nThis material was assessed by specialist officers within the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). After assessing the posts, which contained commentary encouraging attacks against the Igbo, officers determined these posts were in breach of UK\u2019s legislation and a formal investigation was launched.\n\nThe activity was all found to be linked to Adeyinka Shoyemi.\n\nCommander Richard Smith, head of the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command, said: \u201cOur Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit \u2013 the first of its kind to be established anywhere in the world \u2013 was instrumental in identifying Shoyemi and his activity.\n\n\u201cOver the last ten years, the CTIRU has been at the forefront of getting harmful content removed from the internet, and detecting and investigating potential terrorist-related activity online.\n\n\u201cWe continue to need the help and support of the public and I would encourage anyone who comes across material or posts that could be related to terrorism or violent extremist activity to report it to us, so that our specialist officers can take action where necessary.\u201d\n\nShoyemi was first arrested in August 2019 at his home address. Officers searched his address, along with two others in London that he was associated with, and recovered various digital devices.\n\nShoyemi was released on bail while detectives carried out further enquiries and analysed the devices seized. He was charged in May 2020 with six counts of inciting racial hatred.",

          "title": "Untold story of train terror attack",
          "text": "By Noah Ebije And Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nOne of the survivors of the Kaduna train attack has revealed why the escort-security men on board the ill-fated train could not save the passengers from their attackers.\n\nThe 52-year-old man\u2019s revelation followed the information by the Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Mr Freeborn Okhira, that 18 armed security personnel drawn from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSDC) were on board the Abuja-Kaduna train attacked on Monday, March 28 by heavily armed bandits.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nHow we were attacked\n\nFigures showed that while eight passengers lost their lives, about 40 were injured, some of them seriously, out of about 400 said to be on board the train. But an account by the survivor, who refused to disclose his identity for fear and traumatic experience he passed through, showed that the attack recorded such casualties for a number of reasons.\n\nOne, the train fell into a valley when it derailed following the explosion that wrecked its track. Secondly, everywhere was dark, making visibility difficult for the security men on board the train. Three, like Okhira stated, the operatives were not only outnumbered but also outgunned when they ran out of ammunition. Four, the terrorists were at an advantage in that they operated from a higher ground and a familiar terrain quite unknown to the security men.\n\nThe attackers, he explained, planned the attack close to a valley which gave then advantage over the armed security men on board the train. This is why they were able to pin the passengers down for more than one hour.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cI had never had this kind of experience before for the 52 years I\u2019ve lived on earth,\u201d he told Saturday Sun. \u201cWe were approaching Kaduna. About 25 minutes to Rigasa, at 7:43pm, there was a loud explosion. The train began to wobble. Then all of a sudden, it stopped and within two seconds, there were shootings here and there.\n\n\u201cThe security agents inside the coaches were trying to repel the attackers. But their efforts had no serious impact because the place was sloppy. It was like they were up and we were in a ditch; that gave them an advantage over us. That was how we were held for about more than one hour. And then of course, the bandits were entering the coaches randomly because there was no light. We later got to know that they focused more on the two business coaches. They entered my coach and a lady in front of me was shot. She was crying but we couldn\u2019t help because we were all confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. Then, another lady was shot dead.\n\n\u201cSome were trying to run but bullets hit them. Then around 9:35 pm, there was a grave silence and it was then it dawned on us that the bandits had killed, maimed and kidnapped some people Around 10 pm, military men came, about 500 of them. There was no MTN network but there were 9mobile and Airtel, which helped people to send text messsages.\u201d\n\nSaturday Sun learnt that it was during this period that Dr Chinelo Megafu Nwando the dentist working with St Gerald Catholic Hospital, Kakuri, Kaduna, and one of the eight who lost their lives in the attack, sent her last Twitter message via her handle @nelo_x : \u201cI\u2019m on the train. I have been shot. Please pray for me.\u201d\n\nThe survivor further recalled: \u201cThe military then asked us to file out of the train. But there was no strength left in us because we were lying on top of one another. The military men then supported us to walk out of the place because it was a valley. We did that for about one hour 30 minutes until a senior person among them addressed us and asked us to trek to the main road which took us about 30 minutes. When we got to the main road, they brought buses around 2:30 am and we started filing in beginning with the children, women and then men. They took us to the military hospital from where my family came to pick me around 6 am.\u201d\n\nInflux of relatives and sympathizers\n\nThe hospitals where some of the injured were rushed to by military personnel are constantly besieged by anxious relatives, sympathisers and curious members of the public. They include St Gerard\u2019s Catholic Hospital where the late Chinelo practised before she met her untimely death, and the 44 Army Referral Hospital, both in Kaduna.\n\nThe influx of sympathizers, family members and well-wishers to VIPs wards of 44 Army Hospital is unprecedented, the reporter gathered. A medical staff of the hospital was overheard saying: \u201cMore than 100 visitors come to these wards every morning and evening to greet their friends and family members on admission after the incident.\u201d One of the reasons it is so, it was gathered, is because one of the wards allegedly houses a former governor of one of the Northern states.\n\nNurses and security guards at the entrance of the door leading to the VIPs wards have a hectic time controlling the crowd. \u201cThis is about 6p.m and very soon we will start dressing the wounds,\u201d one of the nurses said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see any visitor while we are doing that. But we are having problem stopping them.\u201d\n\nSome visitors were seen discussing in groups within the hospital premises. Others were seen discussing how to raise money to buy some medications for their loved ones, victims of the incident hospitalised there. Some relatives who trooped to the hospitals were in search of their loved ones with whom they had lost contact since after the incident.\n\nBut one of the things that Saturday Sun found intriguing was the general atmosphere of fear of the unknown that seemed to pervade everywhere. It prompted many of the survivors to refuse to disclose their identities. Another survivor who like the first refused to give his name also narrated his experience. He said: \u201cImmediately I heard gunshots from the opposite direction, I ran and hid in one of the toilets of the train. While there, I heard passengers wailing and shouting. I heard the footsteps of the bandits as they moved from one coach to another, killing and abducting passengers. I was panicking in the toilet. I only came out when soldiers arrived for rescue.\u201d\n\nMore survivors\u2019 tales\n\nA third survivor recalled: \u201cImmediately, the train halted, we were all flung about like pieces of property because of the jarring way it stopped. From what I observed, the attackers were expecting the train to derail. But when it stopped before their calculated spot, we started hearing gunshots from all around us. One of the flying bullets hit a lady who was sitting in front of me at her waist. She was just saying: \u2018Help, I\u2019m dying.\u2019 The military men came and took her away. I cannot tell whether she survived or not.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers later brought buses and moved all of us to 44NARHK from where we found our way home. It was a terrible experience. Many people who have not had a live experience of thundering gunshots before that night were seriously traumatised. I pray that the Federal Government wakes up from its slumber and do the needful. The truth is that these criminals appear to be more coordinated, resolute and determined in bringing the government to its knees and they are moving closer to Abuja.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe survivor that first spoke to us, added: \u201cWe need government to do something tangible about this issue of security. There should be security not just for the airport, railway or roads but everywhere. We should feel safe in our land.\u201d\n\nBut some of the survivors hospitalised at Saint Gerard Catholic Hospital were courageous enough to give their names as they shared their experiences with Saturday Sun. One of them, Maimuna Ibrahim narrated her experience thus: \u201cAll of a sudden at about 8 pm we started hearing shootings from outside. We all lay down inside the train. The bandits gained access into the train by forcing the door open and they continued to shoot indiscriminately. I did not know that they shot at my right thigh while I was lying down. It was when soldiers came for rescue that they saw that I was bleeding and rushed me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nFatima Shaibu, who had bruises all over her body said: \u201cThe bandits rushed into the train twice and abducted passengers and took them into the bush. I saw them, they put veils on their faces. They were young men of about 18 years. They were shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 and they spoke in foreign language. They did not speak English; they did not speak Fulani, and they did not speak Hausa.\u201d\n\nFor Chinelo, St Gerard\u2019s in mourning\n\nThe Medical Director of St. Gerard Catholic Hospital revealed that 11 of the survivors were later referred to Army Referral Hospital because of their complicated cases. He said that two of the ones left in the care of the hospital, unfortunately, lost the battle for survival. One of them incidentally was Dr Chinelo, 26-year-old trained dentist from Onitsha, Anambra State, who the authorities took special interest in, because she was one of their staff. When our reporters visited St Gerard\u2019s, they found the management and staff in mourning mood. They all wore long faces while they performed their duties.\n\nChinelo who had her secondary education at Queens College, Lagos before graduating with a degree in Dentistry at the University of Port-Harcourt, Rivers State during the 2015/2016 academic session, did her one-year mandatory National Youth Service Corps at the Kaduna State Dental Centre and worked with St Gerard\u2019s for some years, after completion of her youth service. She worked under the supervision of Rev. Sister Beatrice Danladi, before resigning recently to take up employment overseas. She had concluded plans to relocate abroad before the sad incident took place.\n\nA public statement by the Nigerian Medical Association read: \u201cThe NMA President, Prof. Innocent A O Ujah and indeed all Medical and Dental Practitioners under the auspices of NMA are deeply saddened by the tragic, horrific and preventable death of one of our members, Dr Chinelo Megafu Nwando.\n\n\u201cAs an association, we vehemently decry the worsening insecurity in the country which has made all of us and Nigerians as a whole vulnerable to violent attacks by hoodlums, bandits, kidnappers and terrorists who are currently having a field day causing us deep sorrows and severe pains. The untimely death of the young, promising doctor while striving to earn a honest living is one death too many.\u201d\n\nIn his own statement, Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo commiserated with the family of the young dentist and the Nigerian Medical Association over her unfortunate death in the hand of bandits. He described the circumstances leading to her death as painful but avoidable.\n\nA staff of the hospital who spoke to Saturday Sun on her death but refused to give her name because she is not authorized to speak on the issue, said: \u201cShe did her NYSC service in Kaduna. But when the management saw that she was very good on the job, they decided to give her a job. But last month she resigned because she said her parents said she should come to Canada to join them. So she travelled to Abuja to process her travelling documents. It was when she was coming back by train that she was killed. She was very young and hardworking. She was to leave Nigeria for Canada this weekend.\u201d\n\nChief Medical Director, St Gerard\u2019s Catholic Hospital, Dr Shurkuk Cletus Bako, expressed shock over the sudden death of the lady he described as \u201cone of the finest young staff of the facility\u201d before her resignation about a month ago. He confirmed that she was planning to travel out of the country for further studies and to gain more work experience.\n\n\u201cShe is yet to be buried because we are still discussing with her family concerning the day she will be buried. We still have her corpse here at the facility. Until her death, she was living in our quarters. In fact, her personal belongings are still here. I think it is now that her friends are trying to bring them out.\u201d\n\nFate of the abducted\n\nBut that pain extends to both owners of the dead and the living. Relatives of those abducted, whose number is yet to be ascertained, are doing everything within their power to see them released alive by their abductors. But the amount being quoted by them as their ransom is scary.\n\nAn 89-year old woman who was kidnapped along with his daughter are said to be languishing in the bandits\u2019 den. A family source said the abductors had placed a N70 million ransom on the woman and her daughter.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that the woman is aged and in bad health condition,\u201d a family source said. \u201cThe entire family members are praying for her safe release. The ransom demanded is too high, but if God helps, we will be able to secure their freedom.\u201d\n\nA Kaduna-based POS operator who gave her name as Juliet told Saturday Sun that her brother was among those kidnapped from the train. She said that as at Thursday, the kidnappers had called to request N15 million as ransom.\n\nShe said her brother, 40, was travelling to Kaduna from Abuja where he had gone for medical check-up and treatment before he was kidnapped. \u201cThe kidnappers called today (Thursday) using my brother\u2019s phone. We have been running around since but we have not been able to raise even one-tenth of the money. My brother\u2019s situation is worrisome because he is sick and he is on medication. He needs prayers and we call on everybody to help us pray for his safe release.\u201d\n\nBlood donors/volunteers at work\n\nMeanwhile, volunteers have continued to besiege 44 Army Referral Hospital to donate blood to the hospitalised victims. One of them, Suleiman said: \u201cI saw a crowd of young men and women troop into the hospital, ready, and willing to donate blood. The most amazing part of it is that no one cares to know who the receiver is. Region, tribe, religion and political differences were put aside as everyone was out there to save lives. It gives me joy and hope that Nigeria is going to be strong despite the security challenges. We shall come out stronger and victorious.\u201d",

          "text": "National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello Bodejo has said the votes of his Fulani kinsmen would be for only Southern presidential candidates that are ready to do the bidding of the Fulani.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the leader of the Fulani socio-cultural group said President Buhari is not to blame for the attack on the Kaduna-bound train, insisting that everyone should be concerned with security. He urged Nigerians to also express outrage at what he called the genocide being perpetrated against Fulani herders by the Hausa in the guise of securing lands in Taraba State.\n\nTerrorists on Monday attacked a Kaduna-bound train, killing, injuring and abducting passengers. Is this problem not getting out of hand?\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nIt is part of the problem the country is having. Security is not only to be left with the police or military; it is for everybody. We all are supposed to be involved by giving information to the security agencies. In Kaduna, I have a report that bandits rustled over 10, 000 cows and killed the herders. Fulani in the bushes are almost decimated, as they are the number one victims of banditry attacks. You are not seeing this in the media because journalists would not want to go to the forest to see things for themselves.\n\nFrom survivors\u2019 accounts, the attackers were young Fulani people?\n\nIf they said so, how many people have been arrested? I can\u2019t say it\u2019s Fulani or not. If they were Fulani, how many of them have they arrested? If they were Fulani or they were from other tribes, they are also killing Fulani in the bushes. If they were Fulani, they would not have been killing fellow Fulani in the bushes and forests.\n\nWhat do you expect Buhari to do?\n\nHe should encourage the military and the police to put in more efforts even though they are trying. I call on the Federal Government to provide security for the Fulani herdsmen before they are completely wiped out; they are at the receiving end of this insecurity.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nSome people are calling on Buhari to resign, saying he has failed in his duty to protect the citizens. Do you agree with them?\n\nThey are trying to bring politics into this security matter. Why should he resign? To resign and go where? He can\u2019t resign. Anybody who says he should resign shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. If he is failing, tell him to wake up and change strategy on how to deal with these bandits. My problem is that when the military wants to finish these bandits, the innocent herdsmen in the bushes and forests would also be killed.\n\nIn spite of efforts by the security agencies, killings, kidnappings and other crimes have persisted everywhere. Why can\u2019t there be an end to these challenges?\n\nNobody is happy or should be happy over the insecurity situation in the country, especially the killings, kidnappings and destructions going on everywhere. However, nobody is talking about the way the Fulani herders are being killed in Taraba State, where people in military or police uniforms go inside the bushes and begin to arrest and kill these herdsmen. You can\u2019t say whether they are soldiers or policemen. We are trying to report this to the security agencies. Herdsmen are the greatest victims of these killings going on especially in the North and we are not happy because it is affecting them as they ply their trade in the bush.\n\nWhen did this arrest and killing of herdsmen by men in uniform in Taraba start?\n\nRemember, not quite long, a military aircraft threw bombs where Fulani herders were grazing their cows and killed so many of the cows and some herdsmen. The reports we are receiving from these herdsmen are that some people dressed in military attire come to the bush and arrest them or kill them. We don\u2019t think it is the Nigeria Army, because when they arrest people, they hand them over to the police. But for these unknown uniformed men, the moment they take any herdsman, that is the end. He would never be seen again. We are putting up a petition to the Defence Headquarters to tell them what is happening in Taraba State.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where these people killing our people are coming from because as they are in the bush, it is hard for them to know where these uniformed men were coming from. Even when they see some of them on the road, they would arrest them. Any of them they arrest can never return. They are now scared. Their leaders are coming to tell us.\n\nI have emphasised before, these bandits operate from the forests and bushes, and the same place that Fulani herdsmen ply their trade, and when they come to deal with the bandits, they equally extend it to the herders. It is difficult to differentiate between the two groups. There is why we advise whenever there is going to be a military operation to decimate the bandits, Fulani leaders should join them so that the innocent herdsmen are not killed alongside the herdsmen. When they are bombing the bandits, they also bomb the herdsmen as well, which is not right. If you investigate, you find out that those uniformed men are neither the army nor the policemen. This orgy of killings is affecting our people\n\nBut many people have alleged that the herders were actually the ones killing and sacking communities\u2026\n\nPeople holding that position are propagandists because they have access to social media platforms. If something is happening to herdsmen inside bushes in Taraba, how would you know? Are you a journalist? Even if you were, is it not in Jalingo you would stay and start making calls? For the herdsmen, instead of coming outside the bush, they are now going deeper inside.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe report we are receiving from Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states is that some people in the name of vigilantes are just slaughtering Fulani herdsmen as bandits.\n\nWho are these vigilantes? Are they not Fulani?\n\nThey\u2019re not Fulani, because it is very difficult for a Fulani man to kill a fellow Fulani. They are Hausa. I repeat, no Fulani will kill another Fulani. If there is one Fulani among them, he would not support the others to go and kill his brother. Before, Kaduna and Zamfara states governors have called for the ban of these vigilance groups because they are responsible of these killings in the North. Youths would gather and say they want to secure their lands and start killing these Fulani herdsmen in the name of securing their lands. I don\u2019t think the constitution permits even the police or the army to kill any person when he is arrested.\n\nThe Hausa in these states are committing genocide against Fulani herdsmen there. From the messaging they are sending to me, what is happening to them there is very scary in the name of securing their lands.\n\nKano State governor is conducting census of the herdsmen in Kano, what is it for?\n\nWe discussed with the committee counting the herdsmen. As a governor, you have power to do anything within your state, but counting the herders is not the solution to your problem. I\u2019m here now, after counting my family members, including uncles and brothers and tomorrow we migrate to Taraba State with our cows. How would you know? He should go and count the traders, spare parts dealers, those selling fruits, kola nuts and shoe shiners, Mai Tea and others, not Fulani herders who hardly stay in one place. They migrate to meet their brothers here and there, and you cannot separate them. The governor needs advice; he is a Fulani. How many years has he left these people inside the bush without helping them? They are drinking water from the same source with their cows. They don\u2019t have borehole, they don\u2019t have anything. You say you want to look for solution for banditry.\n\nThe Fulani herdsmen are the number one victims of these bandits. You are the executive governor , you have the power to give them water; you have the power to settle them in a place and make the place a little bit comfortable for them. Give an executive order for the parents to send their children to school. Those who have cows, teach him modern animal husbandry, but you can\u2019t do that. So, any governor who couldn\u2019t do those things has failed the Fulani in whatever he is doing. This doesn\u2019t take him anything to implement if he is sincere and determined.\n\nIn some places, the herdsmen were there before some of these governors were born. Take, for instance, Fulani herdsmen were rearing their cows long before the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, was conceived. Go and check what is happening with them. Today they are displaced and driven from a particular place without compensation. It has been like that since. They didn\u2019t go to meet the FCT, instead it was FCT that went to meet them where they were doing their business of cattle rearing. They have been there and because their cow dung had fertilised the place, then the Gwari people and others started farming on the land.\n\nGo and see how our people are suffering; no FCT minister has deemed it fit to allocate a place to them. Nobody valued the Fulani herdsmen in this country. Why are you counting the herdsmen? You didn\u2019t count their children and send them to school. I respect Ganduje because he is a Fulani brother, but counting them is not the solution. Okay, you know their number. And so what? It remains one year to leave office, you want to do a head count of them, to do what?\n\nPeople allege that the herdsmen take the law into their own hands because President Buhari is Fulani. Some say you guys will become powerless when this administration leaves office next year. What do you say to this?\n\nThey are always saying this. They thought that Buhari being a pure Fulani would value his people more than others, but it has not been so. He has been supporting crop farming through Anchor Borrowers Scheme and in other ways. People around Buhari, especially the former Agriculture Minister, started giving Fulani different names \u2013 RUGA, Cattle Colony, tomorrow this and tomorrow that, which attracted hatred for the Fulani. Even though Buhari has not done anything for our people, those fighting him accuse him of supporting us. We have been hoping that he would remember to do something for us, but our waiting seems to have been in vain. He is busy addressing the problems of other people, while abandoning his own people. The people making that comment should be asked if Buhari can give a grazing reserve. Is it not governors who can give grazing reserves? If the governors want to solve the problem, let them create grazing reserves for the Fulani. There are over 700 grazing reserves; some are gazetted, while other are not. They should implement these reserves and put little amenities like borehole and let the Fulani move there and continue their lives.\n\nSome governors collected some money that they want to go in to ranching, but none of them has done anything. These people that are saying that it is Buhari who is supporting us, after he leaves power, let them come and swallow all the Fulani, which is the only thing remaining. They don\u2019t allow Buhari to rest; they don\u2019t allow us to rest; when we are saying that Buhari hasn\u2019t done anything to us. Ok, they want Buhari to kill us before they would have rest of mind.\n\nSome say if a Southerner becomes president, there might be more punishment for herders who commit crimes..\n\nThey are talking about politics. I\u2019m not a politician even when pressure is being mounted on me to go and contest for governorship or Senate in my state. Anybody who doesn\u2019t have a good mind for this country, God can never allow him to win even primary election, not to talk of winning the general election. This time around, we are prepared and we have directed all the herdsmen and their families to register and obtain their PVCs in all the states they live, especially in the North. For any person who comes from South-East, South-West or South-South who wants our votes, we are going to scrutinize him to know if he belongs to those who say Fulani would not stay in his place, whether he is the person who will protect only the farmers, while leaving the Fulani. Farmers and herders exist side by side; they are together. What is surprising me in this country is that even the mai shai, (the person who makes tea for people) in Kano is valued and given support, but nobody cares about the person who has 100 cows, but it is to do a head count of them the government is interested in. Something is wrong somewhere.Even in the North, especially in the Central, there are some people who don\u2019t want the Fulani, maybe, they can team with the South to hate us. If you hate Fulani, you hate your God. If you know you hate Fulani before, don\u2019t go and waste your money in the election because you can\u2019t win. It is now that you will know that we have value in this country; we will vote you out. You can see the massive votes we are going to turn out in 2023. We have mobilised and our people are getting their voters cards.\n\nAre you saying that your people, the Fulani, will vote only the person who will do your bidding?\n\nYes. That is what I have been emphasising. Before we vote for you, we want to know your plans or programmes for the Fulani herdsmen. Are you among those Fulani haters or you support their business activities? If you want, you can come and seek our advice or you ignore us, it is at your own peril, as we shall meet in the field on the election day.",

          "text": "\n\n\u2022 As 21 are reported missing by relatives\n\n\n\nKasim Sumaina in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Saturday confirmed the safety of 170 passengers, even as it said that 21 passengers were still reported missing by the relatives who made calls to the corporation.\n\nNRC, in a release in Abuja by its Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, read: \u201cYou would recall that on the 28th of March, 2022, suspected bandits attacked the last evening train, AK9 on the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna Train Service with explosives, leading to the death of some passengers and destruction of the train and track.\n\n\u201cBecause of the level of damage on the track and in honour of those that lost their lives, the Corporation suspended train operations on the affected route.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okhiria, while in this mournful mood, it is also important to inform members of the public and the press about the latest development and what the corporation is doing to restore train services.\n\n\u201cThis update has become absolutely necessary so as to prevent the circulation of falsehood or misleading information to the general public.\n\n\u201cFor the records, there were eleven (11) coaches on the train worked by Loco 2502, which is made up of four (4) SPA Coaches with 56 sitting capacity per coach and 7 SP Coaches with 88 sitting capacity per coach.\n\n\u201cThus, the total seat capacity of the train is 840 seats. You may also recall that the train manifest contained 362 validated passengers aboard the train.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss hinted that the corporation, in continuation of its concerted effort through repeated calls, has been able to confirm the safety of \u201c170 passengers, while 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to us,\u201d Okhiria said.\n\nHe further said that the corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe corporation is also not resting on its oars as she has heavily moved human and material resources to the accident site to make sure that train services resumed without further delays in order to reduce the stress that our passengers are currently going through.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast.\n\n\u201cThere is a co-ordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja to the bomb blast site, another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. Restoration of track for full resumption of normal train services will continue today 2nd April 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said further in the statement, \u201cGentlemen of the press, it may also interest you to know that arrangements have equally been put in place for increased security along the track and on board the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cOnce again, our hearts go out to the families of those that lost their loved ones and that of those that are still missing.\u201d\n\nHe however assured Nigerians that the corporation is with the general public in this challenging time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Friday in Abuja updated President Muhammadu Buhari on security developments in his state following the Monday night\u2019s terror attack on Abuja-Kaduna bound train.\n\nThe governor, who was sober about recent happenings in his state, told State House correspondents that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in Kaduna state and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, security agencies have been making frantic efforts to rescue victims of Monday night\u2019s attack on a Kaduna bound train, from the hands of their abductors.\n\nHe disclosed that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in the state and beyond.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i, who spoke in Hausa language, disclosed that the attack on the train was carried out by Boko Haram iinsurgents in collaboration with some bandits operating in Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto and Kebbi States.\n\n\u201cThe President assured me that necessary steps would be taken on the matter and this thing will be brought to an end in few months, and security agents are already carrying out surveillance around where these criminals are and, by the grace of God, they will be rounded up.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, the government will always take precautionary measures to safeguard the lives of citizens, therefore, except the victims are rescued unhurt, the airforce and ground troops will not be able to confront the criminals. So to avoid any colossal damage, the captives have to be freed first,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor confirmed that the gunmen had contacted families of their captives, but yet to request for ransom.\n\n\u201cWell, the families of those kidnapped have been contacted while some of the captives themselves have called their loved ones, saying they are doing well and they are being taken care of. But the gunmen have not shown any sign of collecting ransom,\u201d he added..\n\nEl-Rufai emphasised that the gunmen are not kidnappers but members of the Boko Haram terrorists group working in collaboration with bandits.\n\n\u201cThese ones are not the usual kidnappers but members of Boko who are collaborating with bandits.\n\n\u201dSo we were thinking they will ask for a huge ransom from the state government, not the families of their victims.\n\n\u201dSo far, they have asked for ransom from just one of the families that were contacted.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Kaduna state government is concerned, we have not changed our stand on payment of ransom, so, even if they seek for that from us, we will not pay because we are not ready to do so,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i revealed that the state government had received intelligence report that the gunmen were going to strike on the rail line and had intimated the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the matter, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cWe think this thing happened because we have written twice to the NRC, advising that trains on the Kaduna route should not embark on night trips because we have reports that Boko Haram were in town and they plan to attack the train at night using explosive devices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for massive bombing of all bandit-infected enclaves including forest areas in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna-bound train, which left Abuja at 6 p.m. on Monday, was attacked by suspected terrorists at about 7.45 p.m., just about 15 minutes\u2019 drive before Kaduna.\n\nEight persons had been officially confirmed dead, 46 hospitalised and several others kidnapped following the attack.

The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\n\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, yesterday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\n\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\n\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\n\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\n\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\n\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\n\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\n\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\n\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\n\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\n\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\n\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\n\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\n\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\n\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\n\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\n\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police yesterday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nThe market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\n\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\n\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\n\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Climate action: How women joined forces to kick out coal miners from Benue community",
          "text": "Ibagwa is a community in Owukpa, Ogbadibo LGA of Benue state. Owukpa is a coal-rich area with mining activities going on in different communities \u2014 and Ibagwa is one of them.\n\nOwukpa Consolidated Mines Nigeria Limited, a coal exploration, development and mining company, established in 2003 has been mining in the community since 2007. But in the past year, things have changed as the company which has been mining coal for over a decade in the community downed tools and fled.\n\nJulie Okoh, a member of the community and a climate activist, was instrumental in the company\u2019s sudden exit from the community. In 2014, Okoh began creating awareness using social media on the land degradation and health challenges being experienced in her community as a result of coal mining.\n\n\u201cCoal mining became a doom not a blessing to my community because there is no drinking water, there is no hospital, the children are suffering deformity and malnourishment, infertility became a norm. And so I rose up against it,\u201d Okoh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkoh added that the more reason why she stood against the miners was that as a climate activist, she knows that \u201cclimate change is real, environmental degradation by exploration of fossil fuels is real,\u201d and her community was feeling its devastating impacts.\n\nBefore the company\u2019s exit, protests in the community gathered momentum such that protesters began getting arrested and harassed. This led to the arrest of Okwori Onaji, another environmental activist from the area in July 2020.\n\nAt this point, Okoh decided that more needed to be done to forcefully stop the miners from entering the community. And so in August 2020, she mobilised women in her community to rise up against the activities of the miners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFailed promises fuel women\u2019s agitation\n\nTo this effect, the women began meeting weekly to devise means of sending the coal miners out of their community. Part of their agitations was that the coal mining company had promised the community basic amenities like water, schools, and healthcare centres but never stayed true to their promise. And yet, the community is made to suffer the consequences of the mining.\n\nOn the company\u2019s website, it clearly stated its core values to include: the value for lives and well-being of indigenes of the area of operation and the development of the society it operates in. But none of this is true for Owukpa.\n\nThe road leading to Owukpa remains untarred, sloppy and littered with gullies. The vegetation on both sides of the road can be seen to be dying off and farmers are no longer able to go to farm due to degraded and unproductive lands. And despite its safety policy, Owukpa Consolidated Mines Nigeria Limited located its mining site a stone\u2019s throw away from the only secondary school in the community. This led to physical cracks on the walls of the school and the breaking down of the school buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is the only secondary school that this community has but this is where they [the coal company] deposit and load their coal,\u201d Okoh said.\n\n\u201cThis is where our children read, they read amongst coal, they eat coal, they drink coal, they read coal, because when you are in school the debris falls as they are blasting, the sound from the mines is so devastating. The vibration shakes down the walls.\u201d\n\nShe said the unkept promises were the major reasons for the community\u2019s resistance because the coal mining company \u201ckept saying we will do it, we will do it. So in 2020 we said if you are not doing it, please leave\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Maria Onoja, a woman in her early 80s and the mother of the village chief, said the women took the initiative to block the roads and send away the miners because they could no longer bear the polluted water, degraded farmlands and sicknesses that the community suffered as a result.\n\n\u201cWe blocked the roads to prevent further coal mining because we are dying due to pollution from the coal mining activities,\u201d Onoja said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur health is threatened. There is no water, our roads are completely eroded. We cannot transport our farm produce to the market due to the terrible state of the road. We and our children have become prone to illnesses due to the mining activities.\u201d\n\nWomen invoke deity against coal mining company\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs protests by the women continued for 14 days nonstop from morning to night, the women (old and young) also began receiving threats of arrest if they did not end the resistance.\n\nRose Idoko, a farmer, recalls how during the protest, \u201cthey wanted to fight us, they said they would call the police, they threatened to do all sorts but we did not fear because this is our land. No police will come and arrest us for something that is happening in our community\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Okoh said the major backup which gave the women courage to continue the resistance was the community deity. The women, amid the threats, invoked Ibagwa\u2019s deity of justice, an age-long local gong called Ekwanya, which sits in the community\u2019s shrine and is respected by community members for its power to bring death on anyone perverting justice.\n\n\u201cEven those that were supporting the miners, as soon as they heard we had invoked the deity, they took off their hands. Because the deity does not come out ordinarily, the women brought out the priestess of the deity to make proclamations and it worked for us,\u201d she added.\n\nIt has been over a year since the women invoked the deity that caused the coal miners to abandon their tools and flee the community. Okoh said the diety\u2019s curse is still in place and that is why \u201cup till now, we have not seen them\u201d.\n\nHow long can the resistance be sustained?\n\nHowever, for someone like Idoko, she said the women will continue to hold back the coal miners from entering the community until \u201cthey give us roads, hospitals, water, electricity and school because we need our children to be educated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need them to help us because as we are now in the village, we do not have anything to do because the farmlands are no longer productive. Our cassava and other crops are getting rotten yearly when we cultivate. So we don\u2019t have anything to do,\u201d she lamented.\n\nBut Okoh is worried, because according to her, in as much as she understands the climatic impacts of coal mining and would rather it ends in her community, she doubts if the resistance can go on for long if the people are not empowered. She said she fears that if the coal mining company eventually meets the community\u2019s demands, they might succumb.\n\n\u201cThe ability to stand for resistance is when there is help. If there is no help, you can\u2019t sustain resistance,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I say don\u2019t take coal, I must bring something to sustain my resistance and when I am poor, you give me anything, after a while, I won\u2019t be able to sustain resistance.\n\n\u201cSo, I am asking, whatever we need to do, we need to do it. We must sustain the people, we must empower the people. A people that is not empowered can be enticed with bait.\u201d\n\nMike Terungwa, team lead at Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP), said this is a major challenge facing climate action in communities. He said the government needs to provide basic amenities for communities to be able to adapt, adding that civil society organisations also need to stand up to the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to provide basic amenities, not just to the fossil fuel-dependent communities or the host communities but to everyone around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018No more coal mining in Ibagwa\u2019\n\nThe stories of the indigenes are not different from what is obtainable in coal mining communities around the world.\n\nCoal is known to be the dirtiest fossil fuel because it is the most-carbon intensive when burnt, adding to the global climate change issue. Its terrible impacts on the health of people and the environment were the reason countries committed to phasing out coal at the 2021 COP26 in Glasgow. But this decision was compromised at the last minute \u2014 from phase-out to phase down.\n\nIn 2020, developed countries failed to meet their pledge of providing developing countries with $100 billion per year to support climate action. At the last COP, the countries said the finance will be available in 2023 instead.\n\nAs countries prepare for COP27 in Egypt, people like Okoh and the women in her community are seeking help for the survival of their people, so as to be able to resist coal mining activities. But for now, the women of Ibagwa in Owukpa remain resolute in their stand that there would be \u201cno more coal mining in Ibagwa\u201d.\n\nThis report was first published by Our Climate Impact",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When TNC Africa, a Nigerian television production company, wanted to launch long-form video content that tells original African stories to the world, it chose YouTube as its medium. It was evident that YouTube could provide a platform that would connect it to the world and provide sufficient data for analytics on its audience. \u201cBeing an early-stage startup where data is super important, and one that does a lot of data analytics, we needed a platform where we could get access to that data, and YouTube offered that, \u201c Olawale Adetula, co-founder of TNC Africa said.\n\nAdetula explained that YouTube has the largest share of the video-watching audience it is targeting in Africa, such that even android phones have the app pre-installed.\n\nWhile YouTube aims to provide a platform for creators globally to explore their creativity, in 2020, it shined a special focus on Africa when it launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. The $100 million Fund\u2014created by YouTube as a response to the racial injustice that characterised 2020\u2014is a 3-year initiative dedicated to spotlighting and growing black creators on YouTube, from across the world, by providing them with funding, resources, and mentorship that will help them thrive on the platform.\n\nThe Fund, in the past 2 years, has worked closely with African content creators, musical artists, and, recently, producers and songwriters, offering them seed funding to develop their channels, training focused on upgrading their production, community engagement and wellbeing skills as well as workshops and networking programmes to help them grow their channels.\n\nAdetula\u2019s biggest takeaway from the Fund is the opportunity to network with and form relationships with over 135 other top creators around the world. The Fund\u2019s structure, which encourages every creator to work with another creator, plays a role in ensuring that these relationships are formed; and has translated into upcoming collaborations for TNC Africa, too.\n\nTNC Africa\u2019s target audience has also broadened beyond Africa as a result of the programme. \u201cWe were creating content and targeting viewers within Africa or with African interest because we never thought our content could be appealing to non-Africans. Today, the number of viewers we are getting from the UK, US, Ireland, and South America is steadily increasing since we implemented some of the things we learnt from the YouTube Black Voices Fund.\u201d More people outside Nigeria are getting interested in content created by Nigerian YouTubers.According to data made available to TechCabal by YouTube, over 75% of watch time on content produced by channels in Nigeria comes from outside Nigeria.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s inaugural cohort last year featured a Creator Class of 20 content creators, from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Its Artist Class featured 3 African artists: Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol, South Africa\u2019s Soma Jozi, and Nigeria\u2019s Fireboy\u2014who have gone on to use the platform to connect with their fans.\n\nFireboy\u2019s \u201cPeru\u201d remix with pop star, Ed Sheeran, has gone global, with the song topping music charts across the world. During his time on the programme, on YouTube, he performed a live stream concert to over 83,000 fans who watched the virtual performance, to celebrate Africa Month.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices helped award-winning Kenyan Afro-pop group Sauti Sol become the first Kenyan act to be included on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\nKenyan Afro-pop band, Sauti Sol, perform their Midnight Train album in a virtual concert that has raked over a million views on YouTube. Addy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, YouTube, spoke about Sauti Sol\u2019s excitement when the Fund put their pictures on billboards in New York, Los Angeles and London. \u201cIt was a great Kenya-to-the-world story. They were already celebrated in Kenya; it was amazing to be a part of their success and help them break out of Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures made available to TechCabal by YouTube, in Kenya, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in Kenyan shillings) has increased by over 60%, year over year. While over 400 channels have at least 100 thousand subscribers\u2014an increase of over 70%, year over year\u20146 channels have over 1 million subscribers; and 1 channel has over 1 billion views. Over 45% of watch time on content produced by channels in Kenya comes from outside of Kenya.\n\nWhile the inaugural class had 20 creators and 3 artists from Africa, for the 2022 class, YouTube increased the number to 26 content creators and 4 artists; while creating a new class, for producers and songwriters, a development the Fund said demonstrates its continued support for artists on the platform.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices placed Nigerian artist CKay on a billboard in Los Angeles\n\nA member of the newly-created songwriters and producers class is Nigeria\u2019s brilliant 20-year-old producer, P.Priime, who has produced hits for some of the biggest names in Nigeria\u2019s music industry, including Wizkid, Fireboy, and Olamide. He further blew up this year after it became known that he produced Nigerian artist Asa\u2019s album (except for one song).\n\nP.Priime had heard about the Artist Class but originally didn\u2019t know there was going to be a category for producers, so he was excited when he heard about the newly introduced class. \u201cI was excited that people were starting to recognise the work producers do. I feel we are finally getting our flowers, and people are starting to see our importance beyond working with artists,\u201d P.Priime told TechCabal.\n\nWhen P.Priime joined the programme, they helped him organise his channel, and he started sharing his process\u2014with his video where he took his fans through the making of Nigerian artist Reekado Bank\u2019s hit \u201cOzumba Mbadiwe\u201d raking 63,000 views.\n\nThe Fund helped him get new equipment and has provided him with an opportunity to connect with artists across the world. Although his YouTube channel is monetised, he said he is not all about the money: \u201cIt is giving a piece of P.Priime to my audience, documenting my work process and using the opportunity to reach new audiences even when I am not dropping new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the challenges that African YouTubers face, Awofisayo blamed the late delivery of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\u2014which allows them to monetise their YouTube channel\u2014on African YouTube creators\u2019 countries\u2019 bad postal services. Awofisayo further explained that the reason YouTube sends the PIN via postal service is to prevent identity theft and circumvent fraud.\n\nAwofisayo said that the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund was created to encourage black creators and artists to get on YouTube, amplify their voices, and create an opportunity for them to be successful on the platform. But she revealed that beneficiaries of the Fund do not get preferential treatment or get prioritised on the platform.\n\nAwofisayo revealed that the selection of newer and early-stage creators\u2014creators that have been on the platform for a few years\u2014is a shift from last year when most beneficiaries were established content creators. Awofisayo said YouTube wants to also empower more creators like Nigeria\u2019s Mark Angel, who has built a production company out of his YouTube channel. \u201cIn the long run, we want to make sure that black creators, not just those in the fund, are able to be successful on our platform, and that our platform is an enabler to their creative success,\u201d she said.\n\nNigerian content creator, Tomike Adeoye, a member of the 2022 class of creators made an Instagram post where she expressed gratitude to YouTube for its support and the BlackVoices Fund for providing funds. \u201cThank you for #YouTubeBlack. Thank you for being a great source of income! Just seeing us and doing what we love, we see the dollars flow in our account monthly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn Nigeria, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in naira) is also up by over 60%, year over year, with over 650 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 50%, year over year. Still in Nigeria, 35 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of 50%, year over year.\n\nIn South Africa, the percentage of YouTube channels making 6 figures or more in revenue (in rands) is up over 40%, year over year, with over 300 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 60%, year over year. Still, in South Africa, 25 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of over 30%, year over year. Over 65% of watch time on content produced by channels in South Africa comes from outside of South Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Will B2B ecommerce capture Africa\u2019s informal markets?",
          "text": "As online retail marketplaces flounder in Africa, entrepreneurial hopes for ecommerce turn towards selling to businesses online. Business-to-business (B2B) ecommerce may be a promising route to digitising Africa\u2019s huge informal and offline commerce, but it is not without challenges.\n\nPer data from research consultancy, Briter, B2B ecommerce ventures in Africa secured more than $256 million in disclosed funding last year. Olumide Olusanya, CEO of PayMente Limited, and an experienced ecommerce builder, says B2B ecommerce is now a \u201cvector of choice\u201d startups in Africa leverage \u201cfor the primary purpose of financial inclusion of its mostly informal sectors\u201d.\n\nAs B2B companies like TradeDepot, Wasoko (formerly Sokowatch), and even Jabu prove, B2B ecommerce has become the darling of digital commerce funding venture capitalists in Africa. Entrepreneurs see B2B commerce as the road to Africa\u2019s informal markets, and VCs are placing bigger bets on those hopes. But, the road\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to tapping ecommerce\u2019s potential, by doing business with the African street retailer, is almost as bumpy as the road to the consumer\u2019s door.\n\nA path of least resistance\n\nInvestors and entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly interested in B2B ecommerce as they realise that the montage of colourful roadside vendors with bustling street businesses are more reliable clients than the occasional online shopper.\n\nThe harsh economic realities that continue to influence earning and spending also guarantee that buying consumer goods will remain largely offline in the near future. Consequently, the centralised Jumia version of ecommerce is losing to a model that emphasises selling to the vendors who retail to end consumers.\n\nIt is easier to persuade retailers to use digital channels to manage inventory than to convince consumers to buy every other achet of milk from a website. Retailers are also likely to be familiar with simple digital platforms like WhatsApp. As they are already exposed to digitisation at the communication level, ordering and receiving retail goods in bulk by tapping the Wasoko app on your Transsion phone is easy. It does not require learning new skills.\n\nFurthermore, the International Trade Centre (ITC) claims that the global size of B2B ecommerce is 5 times larger than that of B2C ecommerce. Put simply, small businesses buy more stuff online compared to consumer purchases. In Africa, where offline retail reigns and household consumption may reach $2.5 trillion by 2030, it is easy to see why entrepreneurs believe that B2B marketplaces are a better ecommerce fit.\n\nBut even this low-hanging market opportunity is not a walkover.\n\nA bumpy ride to the street shop\n\nDistribution or \u201croute-to-market\u201d is the core business of B2B marketplaces. They are, in essence, little more than an order-made-easy frontend welded around distribution and warehousing.\n\nSince this is both an aggregation and a distribution service that stops just one level above the direct consumer, it creates better delivery-value density (DVD) and helps marketplaces and manufacturers gather important data about informal retail flows.\n\nBut the advantage of a higher DVD\u2014how startups measure the cost and efficiency of a delivery route\u2014is slim when informal retailers are scattered all over the street. Supplying these informal retailers means that B2B ecommerce platforms are still exposed to so many infrastructure gaps that make selling directly to the consumer difficult.\n\nOne way of solving this challenge is to build more distribution points. The downside to that is that it is expensive and adds to the fragmentation at the wholesale layer of consumer goods distribution. To put it another way, each additional distribution point a MaxAB, for example, creates will eat into the density of orders they have to deliver and, hence, their margins.\n\n2/3 of Africa\u2019s $1.4 trillion retail spending in 2016 was on FMCG goods. Photo/Mary on Unsplash\n\nAs Olusanya (quoted earlier) noted, B2B marketplaces want to digitise informal retailing. But more than simply digitising the inventory and stocking process for street retailers, B2B ecommerce, in many cases, directly competes with wholesale distribution networks with a long history of serving informal retailers.\n\nReplacing the wholesale operators who form the backbone of consumer goods distribution across Africa is not a light challenge. It is even conceivable that some of these non-tech wholesalers have exclusive business relationships with manufacturers. Ignatius Akpabio, TradeDepot\u2019s Director of Growth and Strategy, agrees. \u201cBecause of how big they are, you can\u2019t fight the system,\u201d he says. Instead of competing with wholesalers, TradeDepot says it works with established wholesalers to get supplies and as distribution partners. \u201cWe are in a suppliers market in Nigeria, and, because of this, demand always outweighs supply. There is not enough supply for any one distributor, especially for an aggregator like us who are looking to be more pan-Nigerian and have a more expansive reach. If you don\u2019t have these people as your partners, you will struggle from a supply standpoint,\u201d Akpabio adds.\n\nHe disagrees, though, that TradeDepot will replace wholesalers. According to him, wholesalers are how TradeDepot gets supplies in very few cases.\n\nIt makes sense. The market is huge, and capturing a fraction of it, especially in key urban locations, sounds like a winning strategy. Although good numbers are hard to come by, a 2013 survey of micro-small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria, conducted by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics and the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria put the number of MSMEs in the country at more than 37 million. Small consumer goods shops make up a good percentage of that figure.\n\nSo, while B2B ecommerce may not be a threat to offline wholesale networks today, managing the complex relationships that underpin a B2B business is a conversation startups in this space will have to have sooner than later. Any business that simultaneously deals with wholesalers and African street shops has to.\n\nTaming the streets\n\nIn 2020, Joseph Aito, a former Pernod Ricard sales manager, shared the story of Chinedu Okoroafor, a Nigerian whom he claimed netted \u20a61 million monthly from hawking edibles in Lagos traffic.\n\nWithin 4 years of living in Lagos and selling snacks in Lagos traffic, Okoroafor went from making \u20a640,000 a month to earning around \u20a61 million a month from hawking and operating a loose network of hawkers whom he supplied with both credit and products.\n\nAito\u2019s story highlights the lucrative and eccentric relationship between FMCG manufacturers, wholesalers, and street retailers.\n\nAs Olusanya told TechCabal in a call, one feature of the retail scape is how retailers, and even a few big supermarket chains, prefer revenue over efficient inventory management. One may dismiss this as senseless irony because being more efficient may translate to better revenue. But, again, as Aito\u2019s story shows, consumer goods distribution in Africa can be irrational. Aito wrote: \u201cManagers from multinational companies started to seek him [Okoroafor] out. He provided a unique service to them. When they need a quick sales spurt to end the month on a high, they visit him, offering a larger discount than is typical. In a similar vein, when consumables are close to expiry, these companies offer him ridiculous discounts, sometimes as high as 60%, to sell off the stock.\u201d\n\nWhat is more? The bulk of Okoroafor\u2019s sales came from reselling these products to other retailers in his network.\n\nInventory management is met with a blank expression for \u201cretailers\u201d like this\u2014and they are not only roadside hawkers. In this type of environment, where turnover is the primary concern, a B2B marketplace selling \u201cefficiency\u201d to retailers may be talking to a wrong, or, at best, limited market.\n\nOrdering new inventory from a smartphone is easier and cheaper for retailers, but the real party benefiting from efficiency are the makers of consumer goods. Instead of sending a sales representative to drive around blindly with supplies, they simply pass on the headache to B2B intermediaries like TradeDepot.\n\nBecause B2B ecommerce startups are primarily regional and operating in relatively new territory, the competitive bloodbath is not apparent. However, as the space becomes more defined and more local competition arises, retailers will be spoiled for choice in a low-margin business. On the positive side, this may lead to interesting mergers and acquisitions (M&A). We already see some of that. Last year, TradeDepot, Nigeria\u2019s leading B2B ecommerce startup, alone raised $110 million. By February 2022, it acquired GreenLion, a Ghanaian B2B ecommerce startup and launched buy-now-pay-later schemes for its retail partners as it plotted an ambitious expansion programme.\n\nThis competition and M&A may even touch startups like Kippa and Oze, who are working on digitising informal retail records.\n\nThe jury is still out on how much digitisation B2B ecommerce can drive. What is clear is that digitising African commerce will not take the \u201cdigital-mostly\u201d shape found in China because B2B infrastructure relies on and even enables Africa\u2019s dukas, spazas, and provision kiosks to sort out the last leg of commerce.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, a new month, and I hope you\u2019ve had a productive and satisfying week. This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market. While these startups offer it as a standalone service, it is just one of several services that Khazna offers.\n\nThe startup also offers a buy now, pay later service, available in 1,000 merchant stores in Egypt. With 150,000 users, the startup is dreaming big and plans to increase that number to 1 million by the end of 2022.\n\nApril\u2019s Techpoint Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\n\nThe quote above attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggests that the man with a better product will always have the most customers.\n\nHowever, with numerous (identical) brands competing for our attention, it\u2019s not enough to have a good product. It would help if you told your story clearly and compellingly.\n\nNot everyone loves to speak before a crowd or even knows how to do it right, but you can get better with practice and feedback.\n\nAt Techpoint Pitch Friday, entrepreneurs not only get to pitch their startups before an enthusiastic crowd but get feedback that helps with product development or refining their pitch.\n\nIn March\u2019s edition, Dayo Oyekanmi and Oluwafemi Adeleke pitched Harmony and Siara, respectively, and it could be your turn this month.\n\nREGISTER for a chance to pitch your startup or be a part of the audience on Friday, April 8, 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "One survivor of the terror attack Monday on a Kaduna bound Abuja train, Anas Iro Danmusa, has recounted how his phone call and use of social media from inside the attacked train saved the lives of hundreds of passengers.\n\nHe also narrated other unpleasant experiences he and other passengers encountered while inside the train including the presence of two suspected terrorists holding guns and walkie talkies.\n\nDanmusa said a combination of social media use helped in alerting the authorities about the situation.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is to express my sincere appreciation to the Facebook family for being there for us \u2013 those that were on the Kaduna-bound train that was attacked by terrorists on Monday night.\n\nRead also: How I survived the Abuja-Kaduna train attack \u2013 survivor\n\n\u201cIt was amazing how a large number of facebookers swiftly acted upon our posts by sharing as suggested which led to the message reaching the appropriate people and authorities within just a short time. It also led to the message crossing to all social media platforms.\n\n\u201cIf not for your efforts, only God knows what would have happened to us. As you were there for us, may God also come to the aid of each and every one of you in your time of need. We cannot thank you enough!\n\n\u201cIt all started from our coach on the train where I wanted to use my phone to seek help but other passengers were highly against it because phone brightness meant more shooting in that direction.\n\n\u201cThat was how I first contacted my vibrant special bro Al-Amin Sulaiman that has always been there for me. Before I could do that, my head and hands together with the phone were covered with the green train seat cover to avoid drawing attention.\n\n\u201cIn just a few minutes, I was already on the phone with Samuel Aruwan\u2026you should know who that is because he is a hero.\n\n\u201cThat was how he requested I share our location on WhatsApp and to the glory of God, it went through using airtel despite the poor network coverage.\n\nRead also: Train attack: What is integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution?\n\n\u201cHe then forwarded it to the Army Officers and that was how we were tracked on time. Note that all the terrible things were happening at the same time but I was making efforts to make contact in order for us to get help.\n\n\u201cMy brother was able to engage me with the DSS, one Brigadier General Adebayo and Hon. Commissioner Samuel Aruwan.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers informed me that the air force could not make it due to the weather but help was on the way and they fulfilled their promise.\n\n\u201cI could say their response and arrival was the fastest anybody could achieve by road. I can never forget what the HQ Nigerian Army did for us.\n\n\u201cThey responded swiftly, rescued us, comforted us, gave the badly injured priority and made sure they were dispatched to 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital and finally took the rest of us to the same destination with mostly their buses. I pray you to keep growing stronger and winning your battles against the enemies of the nation.\n\n\u201d I also pray that God gives the FG the wisdom and capacity to keep supporting you in the best way that will enable you to discharge your responsibilities. We are very proud of you. Not forgetting the DSS and the role they also played. We are so grateful. May God give you the wisdom to keep tracking the bad elements in our society and making it better for all of us.\n\n\u201cWhat this terrible situation reminds me of is having competent leadership. If Mr Aruwan was out of the equation, the story would have been different no doubt.\n\n\u201cHis quick response to the situation and in engaging the army makes him a competent and reliable public servant. He is an example of what we are lacking in leadership in Nigeria. I must thank the Executive Governor too, His Excellency, Nasir El-Rufai for putting in place competent people that can actually get things done without excuses or pointing fingers.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to draw the attention of the Nigerian Railway Corporation NRC to how grossly they take records of passengers.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t know when keeping a record professionally is important until when the need for the record emerges even when you don\u2019t use it to make future plans and policies\u2026\n\n\u201cLet me start by myself as an example. I bought my ticket at the Kubwa train station. The guy that sold me the ticket collected my information before printing and giving me my ticket.\n\n\u201cFrom the passenger manifest, I observed that 08087545321 was the number against my name which I don\u2019t recognize. I think it was randomly assigned to me which is illegal.\n\n\u201cCheck serial no. 268 and 269 you\u2019ll see 33333333333 for both as phone numbers. Check 223 and 224 you\u2019ll see 6495999999 and 9292999999 as phone numbers respectively. Are those numbers phone numbers?\n\n\u201cSome of the passengers I spoke with were also assigned wrong numbers, especially those that didn\u2019t buy tickets online.\n\n\u201cThe NRC management needs to do better by doing the job given to them satisfactorily by showing a high level of professionalism. Lack of good record keeping has its own consequences.\n\n\u201cOn the train, we saw many things. We have seen dots but we couldn\u2019t connect anything until after the attack when we were miraculously rescued.\n\n\u201cThe NRC and the government, in general, have a lot to do to be able to succeed in rendering trouble-free train services apart from installing explosive detectors and other gadgets.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, what shocked me the most was to see about 3 doors left open on a moving train. I have never seen or heard that and I don\u2019t know how it happened. It was one elderly man that felt it was weird and had to close them because it was dangerous.\n\n\u201d Two unverified claims that I want to share which the NRC could use in improving the safety of passengers are: many passengers claimed they saw weird things and these people are not the types that you\u2019ll say it was the trauma of the incidence that was affecting them or they did not know what they were doing.\n\n\u201cSome passengers said they saw a strange man that was not in uniform with a walkie talkie phone but they felt it wasn\u2019t their business.\n\n\u201cNote that the terrorists that attacked the train were using walkie talkie phones to communicate with the person co-ordinating things from outside. Hope you get the point?\n\n\u201cAgain, a lady saw someone that was part of a gang that kidnapped her some time ago and had the intention of raising an alarm at Rigasa train station if not for the unfortunate event that happened.\n\n\u201cThese two claims were shared with us but I believe even if they are not true, the NRC as part of the new strict measures that will be in place, could use this information so as to avoid future occurrence of such.\n\n\u201cFinally, my heart goes out to those that lost their lives and their families, may their souls rest in peace. I pray that God makes it easy for those kidnapped and their families too, may He enable them to make it back home safely and in good health.\n\n\u201cWe that were traumatised, God knows best the right punishment for the evil, may those callous people never know peace anywhere they are and may any unrepentant TERRORIST die a miserable death.\n\n\u201cIf our leaders keep being indifferent about the difficulty the citizenry face, I pray God replaces them with those that will care for us and make the country a much better place for us all\u201d, he ended.",

          "text": "Mfon Ekpo is the CEO of The Discovery (Training and Development) Centre, a founding partner, and an Executive Director with the John Maxwell Team. She is widely known by the moniker- The Excavator however after a riveting evening with her in Abuja, I\u2019d add to that list, the title- Mental & Emotional Architect.\n\nAs a certified human behaviour consultant, development strategist and professional negotiator, she has served as a member of the President\u2019s Advisory Council and is a two-time recipient of the \u2018Golden Quill\u2019 award by the National Academy of Bestselling Authors in Hollywood for co-authoring two bestselling books with renowned leading experts such as Brian Tracy and Robert Allen amongst others.\n\nShe has spoken and taught at The University of Oxford, Yale, Harvard, Howard University, The University of Southampton and High Point University, North Carolina amongst others.\n\nMfon serves as an advisor to leaders around the world, a Mentor on the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme (TEEP) and sits on the Board of Directors of Wentors, an information technology organization with a mandate to increase the rate of participation and retention of Women in Technology.\n\nLatasha Ngwube\n\nYou are the founder of The Discovery Centre. What exactly is its mission?\n\nThe Discovery Centre is a human potential and performance Coaching, Training and Development organization. We specialize in developing effective systems, strategies, and structure for individual or organizational development.\n\nBased on years of evaluating the huge reserve of latent talent and possibilities within Nigeria\u2019s demographic composition, especially with women, our core focus over the past 7 years has been helping women from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of expertise investigate, excavate, and harness these latent capabilities and then translate them into profitable, impact driven ventures.\n\nAlthough we focused on women initially, the continuing demand resulted in our programs being opened to men also.\n\nIn these times when the general idea of motivational speaking has been reduced to an \u201cAspire to perspire\u201d rhetoric, how do you separate yourself and your calling from the rest?\n\nFirst, in spite of all the clich\u00e9s that surround it, motivational speaking has and will always be pivotal in galvanizing action and driving change. From Lincoln\u2019s \u2018Gettysburg address\u2019 to Mandela\u2019s \u201cI Am Prepared to Die\u201d speech at the Rivonia Trial. Words alter mindsets, challenge human consciousness and are by far, one of best methods in painting a picture of possibilities. Think of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s 1588 speech to the troops at Tilbury,\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, I am come amongst you at this time, not as for recreation or sport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honor and my blood, even the dust.\n\nI know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart of a King, and of a King of England, too; and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms: to which, rather than any dishonour \u2026 I myself will take up arms; I myself will be your General, Judge, and Rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.\u201d\n\nWhat power. What a tool. What a speech!\n\nSo, I very much wear the \u2018aspire to perspire\u2019 badge attached to motivational speaking with honour but also with an intrinsic of understanding of its power and how to harness it.\n\nTo that end, I don\u2019t seek to separate myself from the rest, I seek instead to do my job of speaking, training, and coaching so well that it produces the results that it needs to deliver. That is the separator, I guess.\n\nCan you recall the exact moment you decided \u2018The Law\u2019 could not and would not be the career path for you to follow till the end?\n\nOh, you never fully \u2018leave\u2019 law, if you really studied it as I did from Business law to Public and International law, to Maritime law and Aviation law. It never really lets you go; it follows you everywhere like a jealous lover.\n\nI was my mother\u2019s legal handbag and through her, I developed the love for law. She was a Legal Adviser and Director in the Ministry of Justice, and I was studying law so it we were a tag team of senior lawyer and baby lawyer. We had our plans \u2013 everything from opening a law firm to becoming a SAN but I knew very early I was not going to actively practice law the way practice was known at the time. I was more fascinated in teaching it, writing about it or just exhaustively pointing out the loopholes in it. I considered dropping it all together, but my mum encouraged me to complete the study of it because I was good. After Law school, precisely on the day of my Call to Bar, after I had been presented the award for National Overall Best Student in Professional Ethics, she said \u201cYou have done that which I have asked, never once complaining, you now have a knowledge of law and you have excelled at it. I am certain that in a world that trades on power no one can intimidate or diminish you.\n\nSo, give me this certificate and go do whatever you want to do with your life, your bases are covered\u201d.\n\nI knew she still worried about what I would do with my life and what a speaker\u2019s career trajectory was, but then in 2013 she accompanied me to the International Maxwell Certification in Orlando Florida. I was billed to speak and sharing the stage with John Maxwell, Les Brown, Nick Vujicic, speaking to over 2000 leaders from over 54 countries.\n\nWhen I finished and got off the stage, she said \u2013 \u201cI was wrong to worry. I just watched a young African woman who happens to be my daughter hold a room of leaders from around the world spellbound. This where you belong\u2013 on stage, speaking to people\u2019s hearts and minds and I\u2019m glad I got to witness it. So do it and never look back\u201d.\n\nI have never looked back.\n\nWhy did you decide to study under John Maxwell and how exactly did you go about making it happen?\n\nI have always been fascinated by human behaviour, personal development, and its connection to the transformational development of a country or continent.\n\nJohn Maxwell was the prime example of the impact one man could have in the lives of individuals, organizations, and countries. I wanted that. I wanted all of that and I wanted it direct from source. I wanted to be taught by the best, so I packed my bags and went in search of him, got into the program he was offering at the time.\n\nI was one of the first Africans to join his team, became a Founding Partner of the John Maxwell Team and a member of the Presidents\u2019 Advisory Council, working closely with him at mentorship level, and travelling with him to countries like Guatemala, Costa Rica , Paraguay at the invitation of their governments to conduct nationwide transformational leadership trainings.\n\nWhy has it been so important to you to focus on women in your work?\n\nThe World Bank in its 2012 Development Report stated that it was slower to implement women empowerment initiatives in Africa than in any other region of the world. That was shocking to me and so I set out to investigate that narrative, travelling to the various regions of Africa- from Kenya, to Uganda, South Africa, Ghana , Cameroon , Nigeria discovering it wasn\u2019t that these women empowerment initiatives didn\u2019t work but that there was little or no understanding of the socio economic, political, cultural or religious contexts of these women before interventions were prescribed or in some cases imposed to mark standardised developmental milestones.\n\nWomen\u2019s empowerment, especially in Africa, is more complex, non-linear, and unpredictable than generic development models assume and understanding the underlying causative factors of their behaviour could speed up the process of change and development within their communities.\n\nSo, immersing myself in their communities, I worked within their contexts to create context specific developmental models, influence policy and drive socio- economic change.\n\nThis birthed the 7-year targeted development program for women called \u201cThe Blueprint of How\u201d, which has now reached over 300,000 women-driven businesses not just in Africa but around the world. The McKinsey Global Institute reports that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could grow by 23 percent\u2014or $229 billion\u2014by 2025, if women participated in the economy to the degree that men did. I think this picture is self-explanatory \u2013except we begin to take seriously our focus on women we will always be behind the curve terms of development. That\u2019s why I focus on women.\n\nRead also: Metaverse value to hit $8trn by 2030, with five billion users\n\nWhat have you found to be the most rewarding thing about the work you do now?\n\nThere is nothing like turning on a lightbulb in someone\u2019s life that had come to accept darkness as their norm. Seeing people, especially women, move from accepting life as is, to creating the life they really want never gets tired for me. Witnessing the transformation and the impact of one person being on fire, Swiss Psychologist Carl Jung once said the most damaging thing in the life of a child is the unlived life of a parent. So, when one person gets it right, entire households are affected. Children send me notes of what they studied while their parents were on a coaching call. It is wholesome transformation at the most cellular level of impact.\n\nDo you believe women can have it all and if you do, then do you have it all?\n\nI think you can have it all \u2013 I do, the caveat is you just must define what \u201call\u201d means to you and understand the seasons of how \u201call\u201d may manifest. Some fruit doesn\u2019t manifest as a fruit just because you want it to. It can first manifest as a seedling and if you understand that then you don\u2019t keep complaining that you don\u2019t have the desired fruit, you work with the seedling. It all doesn\u2019t come at once, it really shouldn\u2019t \u2013 it would be too overwhelming, but it does come. So, I don\u2019t teach balance, I teach seasons. Your life can be so out of balance in one season, but that season can accommodate it in a way other seasons in your life may not be able to. For example, when a woman starts a business, in that season, something else may be deprived of time, but if she understands that she can prepare for it, prepare those around her to support her with what that particular season of her life requires and let go of the guilt of reduced availability. When we compare seasons and act like it\u2019s all the same, we suffer. Life and nature revolve around seasons not necessarily balance.\n\nThe work you do sounds very high minded and complex. Have you ever suffered imposter syndrome and how did you overcome it?\n\nNot at all. I think the rise of the feeling of Imposter Syndrome in our generation is the effect of certain causes, one of the major ones being Speed. We are geared towards speed -speed of accomplishment, speed of election, speed of positioning, speed of recognition and the list goes on. And while not altogether bad, speed comes at a cost, the cost which is the circumvention of the process one needs to go through to be ready for exposure, opportunity, position or recognition.\n\nThe process is the pruning period that eliminates ego , exposes error, uncovers your insecurities, reveals faulty conditioning then centres, teaches, matures, prepares you and helps you redefine meaning.\n\nWhen you are ready, not perfect, but ready, imposter syndrome becomes an insignificant threat because anything ceases to be risky when you are equipped for it.\n\nEver felt imposter syndrome on the topic of brushing your teeth or bathing? You have done it so many times, in so many ways that it would be laughable to have imposter syndrome about that.\n\nAs simplified as that example is, the point is \u2013 The triune factors of Expertise, Experience and Time destroys Imposter Syndrome. But alas, speed doesn\u2019t adequately deliver those \u2013 Process does.\n\nBecause I am keenly aware of this, I take my life and career processes very seriously. I can attribute the absolute lack of imposter syndrome to that.\n\nWho are the kind of women (people) that need your services?\n\nAnyone convinced there is more to them than what they are presently deploying. Particularly those who have reached some level of achievement or acclaim. It is the most dreadful thing to live in the prison of your own achievements. It becomes hard to even speak about it because everyone else thinks you should be grateful and excited, but you are really dying inside. Sometimes it manifests as overwhelm, the loss of joy at the present, dissatisfaction, lethargy, and just all-round discontent. Most people who haven\u2019t experienced this can be completely blind to it so the lack of empathy is as crippling at that level.\n\nWhat makes you so highly sought after in this field of personal development?\n\nI would not presume to suggest there is a single answer to that or suggest that is the consequence of just one thing but this much I know: Results are the top of my value list. I am a dog on bone when it comes to getting results, I won\u2019t let go. When clients trust me to help them figure out their lives or businesses, they are also in the same breath trusting me with their pain- the parts of their lives or businesses they keep protected and I am acutely aware of it. That is sacred, it is delicate surgery and requires an enormous amount of courage and trust. So, it\u2019s not a prescriptive process from me in the sense that I don\u2019t just tell them what to do, Personal development, the real kind, is not a walk in the park, its difficult enough on its own. So, its tag team once I get involved with a person or organization. I enter the trenches with them, walk the journey with them, face their giants with them, till the transformation they desire happens. Till water turns to steam.",

Assessing customers needs and being consistent in the quality of products we offer, allows us to build trust and effectively deliver services.\n\n4.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChief Dr. Billy Osawaru is a financial expert and consummate entrepreneur. A very well traveled financial Analyst that doubles as financial Adviser and senior marketing Director with World financial Group, Trans-America financial Advisers in Atlanta Georgia, U.S.A.\n\nDr. Billy Osawaru is a consistent politician and a loyal party man who believes in the collective development of the people of Orhionmwon / Uhunmwode Federal constituency, hence his desire to seek their mandate to represent his constituency at the Federal House of Representatives.\n\nThe ebullient Chief Obazuwa of Benin Kingdom bares his mind to the trio of Tunde Eigboremolen, Oboh Sylvester, Editors, Special project and Ken Abu in Benin City.\n\nExerpts:-\n\nKindly introduce yourself to our readers.\n\nI am Chief Dr. Billy Osawaru, the Obazuwa of Benin Kingdom. I am a Financial Experts, you can call me financial analyst or Financial Adviser.\n\nI am a Senior Marketing Director with World Financial Group, Trans American Financial Advisers in Atlanta, Georgia U.S.A.\n\nI am aspiring for the office of the House of Representatives to represent the people of Orhionmwon/Uhunmwode Federal Constituency. Yes, I am aspiring for this office because I believe strongly that no nation can stand without good laws. And I believe we should send responsible men and women to handle and make laws in a sane society. Yes, you will agree with me that Nigeria is not where it supposed to be because, even though we might have some good laws in the books, but we really need to use oversight functions to see that those laws are being executed by the executive.\n\nSo, I decided to throw my hat in the ring because I can deliver for the good people of Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode in particular and the good people of Nigeria in general. Like I said before, going there to make good laws is not something every single person is able to do. It is something you should have a passion for, first of all, and it is something may be you should have done one or two things in that aspect.\n\nWhen I was in college, I was a student union president. When I was doing my masters in Ashyla International University in the U.S, I was the Head Delegate to the United Nations on the Model United Club. And part of what we used to do there was making laws. At that time you could call it the youth making the laws. Yes we used to do a lot of role play at the UN building in New York. And I led a lot of delegations while I was Student Union President. It is something I have done in the past. And it is something I have developed passion for, because, I see how good laws can transform a nation. Having said that, because a lot of our people might come up with some good laws but we still lack in the oversight function of it.\n\nWell, my people just make laws and they walk away that is one aspect. I want to make sure you actually put the executive feet to the fire because, when you set up good laws you want to make sure those laws are carried out. Moreover in our system here in Nigeria, the legislators actually have a provisions where they are able to execute certain projects they call constituency projects. So I don\u2019t\u2019 think I want to be a lawmaker with this kind of responsibility and I be able to attract those projects to my Federal constituency. So I want to be able to do that as well because my Federal Constituency, Orhionmwon is the second largest producer of gas in Nigeria; so I don\u2019t see why Orhionmwon should not be compensated when it comes to what is being gotten from Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode. As we speak right now, it is so close to the seat of power called Benin City, but it is still far from development. We still have communities today in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon not electrified and that is very unacceptable because from the bye-pass in Benin \u2013 City to Ehor which is the capital of Uhunmwode is just about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSo it is a shame to find out big communities there where we still don\u2019t have electricity. They have never been electrified before and no good roads. A place like Abudu that is the headquarters of Orhionmwon still cannot be elevated to the status of a city. T to me that is a shame!\n\nSo, I should be able to attract capital and infrastructural development to those kind of places. Because I believe whatever you are able to attract to those places will attract markets to those places in form of bringing people.\n\nFrom the way we spoke, from the insight about your background, it is clear that you are an elitist politician. How close are you to your people? You have been away from home for a long time. How connected are you to your people?\n\nAm not the type of politician you want to term a Diaspora politician, because I am fully grounded. I am in Nigeria every other month. And to be frank with you, this is my fourth journey. This is not the first time I am journeying for elections. Twelve years ago, I ran for the State House of Assembly, and I was stepped down for Hon. Mrs. Elizabeth Ativie which I obliged because in politics you have to be a party man. When the leaders see that 2 or 3 people are running for a particular office, yes you should be magnanimous to respect the leaders when they take those kind of decisions. The second time I was equally stepped down again because at that time, Governor Oshiomhole said that they had some issues where APC members who left for PDP and Hon. Ativie did not leave, that we should allow her finish her second term. Which, painfully I had to comply again, coming over time trying to do all this even though I was promised that the next time, those same people will allow me but it was not like that. When it got to that time and we saw how some leaders came and said they have the candidate and that they will not let me scale through.\n\nBut again this is my fourth time and there is nothing, and I repeat, nothing for the past 12 years politically that is happening here in Benin City, Edo State or Nigeria that I have not participate physically or financially or otherwise. So I am not somebody you want to say is far from his people.\n\nAm sure if you have seen my declaration of my intentions to run this time, you will agree with me that I am on ground because my people are there to always support me. They are very excited because, all the time I was stepped down, they were so scared and worried that I will leave and never to come back. But they have seen that I have always been consistent and persistent. That is the kind of person they want to represent. So this time they actually came to me, pleaded with me to go to the House of Representatives to represent them because I have been doing a lot of things at my level on my capacity for my own people. Talking about who is grounded, I can tell you, I might have my job outside the country, but it really does not stop me from playing politics in Nigeria, because my business is such that it can run itself with or without me. And I am always here to deliver and to serve my people.\n\nAnd that brings to the level of consultation. How was it when you declared your intentions to run based on your level of acceptability?\n\nThe Consultation actually started from them. They consulted me to know if its something I would accept and I told them that I am always ready to serve them. They invited me to come talk to the people at home which I did and before I started anything I had to reach out to some apex leaders at the two local governments. They all encouraged me that I have sacrificed for the party and they believe it is my time to come serve the people. And the leaders found out that they feel like they owe me and that they are indebted to me because of my sacrifice all these years. So far, I can tell you almost 80 to 90 percent it has always been the same story. They know I am capable, they know I am qualified, they know I have all it takes to deliver. Now they just feel this is the right time for me. So up to the local government level, I have done consultation. As a matter of fact, last Saturday which was about 4 days ago that was when I declared my intention in the Local Government. Sunday was Orhionmwon and Saturday was Uhunmwode. So everything is looking good so far because I am getting overwhelming support from everybody.\n\nWith good laws, a nation can develop. As a lawmaker, do you think you will be able to bring dividends of democracy to the doorstep of your people?\n\nYes, you can, like I said before, I just enumerated some of the responsibilities of a lawmaker as it pertains to Nigeria as a country. Firstly, you are going to be making good laws right. Again whether it is a town, village or city, good laws can transform any of these. What are the good laws? Good laws that are pro-business, good laws that will be pro-employment, good laws that will be pro-women, doing all the stuff that they need to do.\n\nWhen I say \u201cpro\u201d I mean creating conducive environment for these different categories of people to actually survive and flourish. Once the good laws are there you take it to the level of oversight function. When they know that there is a lawmaker that put the executive feet to the fire, trust me, something will be done. It is always going to be better than where you don\u2019t have this kind of oversight function. A lot of things can be taken for granted especially by the executive. Right? So if as a lawmaker I am always making sure those laws are being carried out by the executive and if they don\u2019t, we are going to get the judiciary that will interpret those laws for them.\n\nYou see, a lot of things don\u2019t work because of little or no resistance from the quarters those resistance are supposed to come from. So, if I am a lawmaker, that is my job. That is my duty to make sure those laws are carried out. So when they are doing anything, trust they want to get me off their back by just doing the right thing. But again, wherever they can take things for granted, they will always do, yes that is one.\n\nThen two, I talked about constituency projects. Constituency projects, the way I understand is more like the executive portion of the lawmaker. Wherever they are going to give him some allocations maybe to providing clean water for your people, providing good roads for your people, providing electricity which is basically what the executive primarily should do; but again it they providing those options for us as lawmakers of course, we have to take advantage of it. Do you think I want to connect all the villages in my constituency? Of course, I want to. So what do I do? Because a provision where I can put roads construction on the budget? Of course, I will be glad to do that. Do you think my people will be happy to see that there is no village that is electrified in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon? Of course, they will not be happy. What do you think I will do? At that point I need to actually build a relationship with whoever is the minister, Federal Minister of Power to see that we bring this home. Same thing with Federal Ministry of Water Resources. So those kind of relationship is what I am talking about. Being able to attract the facilities that will attract businesses to your people. That is how you can transform a village, a city and a town or country.\n\nDevelopments all over the world are driven by technology. Do you think your party is disposed to bringing all these technology into actualizing these goals you have enumerated?\n\nI am going to take your question talking about how technology savvy my party is. You see as a lawmaker going to the Federal Capital Territory (F.C.T) the National Assembly to make laws, I am sure this has gone beyond a political party. Going there, I am going to be making laws with 359 others.\n\nAgain, it now depends on some of us that are widely traveled, that really understand. We really understand and we believe in it. So it is now the convincing power that we have to actually get some of our colleagues whether you are APC or PDP to believe some of those things that we believe in. That is what really matters here. You as somebody that has really went far and wide trust me, I live in one of the greatest country in the world, which is the United States of America, number one in technology. So I am living it as well. So you think if I want to come down here to make laws for my people, it is not something I want to embrace.\n\nYeah, it is something I want to embrace because I have already embraced it over there. And these are some of the things that will make people like us, assets to our party and the country because we have seen it and we have live it somewhere else because we really believe this is where to go. This is the 21st century, the world is seen over there as global, why because of technology. So this is one of those things somebody like me am going to be pushing for through bills. I will sponsor such in form of bills because, I want to use my Federal Constituency as a pilot project to see that I am creating a technological hub in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon that can actually become a model for other Federal Constituencies. Why because, I know it is the way to go. I can tell you we are already 10 years behind in Nigeria behind other developed societies.\n\nSo we are trying to catch up so that it becomes a priority of mine to make sure whatever we are doing right now, let us start from the elementary. You have to catch them young with technology. So whatever we are going to be doing everything will start from the nursery, making all those gadgets available to those kids. Making it a priority for our kids to be able to use technology to solve problems, to do critical thinking and so many other things.\n\nYou know showing interest in anything technology, I will be willing to sponsor people from constituency on international programmes that have to do with technology and I will be willing to invite technological experts to Nigeria too when we are having events that has to do with technology so that our people should always be exposed to the benefits of technology so that they can embrace it.\n\nAny plans for youths of Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode?\n\nI believe in a country like Nigeria where you have 60 percent population are youths. You can not do a whole lot without carrying the youths along. Most of the things are pro \u2013 youths. Like you talk about employments and all that. A case in point is the National Directorates of employment.\n\nI have been sponsoring that program for the past 6 years and what I do is make some money available for these people to get/or receive training of youths in my local government.\n\nThey are able to do that successfully up to a point of being able to secure soft loans from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I received a call last week that one of my participants received a loan of 3 million naira. I think that is what we supposed to be doing more. If a youth cannot be gainfully employed, then he can be the employer.\n\nPart of how you do that is giving them those opportunities. Another thing we are doing right now is that we actually came together, you an call it the who- is-who in Uhunmwode Local Government Area not really the old ones but the young ones like us too. And part of what we are doing for our youth is to help them source for opportunities everywhere both in Corporate and government, and we get those opportunities. We can go back home and get some of those youths. Bringing those information to those youth is one way to help them out. As a matter of fact, I just collaborated with the lady mechanic that has a very huge program and is able to get a lot of grants from German, Italian and U.S.A governments all over. We just collaborated, and I have just been able to secure some slots for Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon youths to be able to embark on trainings even abroad. There is one currently going on now, they are taking them to Cyprus.\n\nIt is a four years program where everything is going to be paid for and that student get some stipend and by the time that student comes back, he or she is gainfully employed by BMW or COSCHARIS or other. Again those are things I will continue to do because some of the youths if they begin to see how others youths are taking advantage of opportunities we are bringing that I am part of; I think a lot of them would want to key into these kinds of things. And that is how countries get better.\n\nWithout putting any numbers to it, I am just one man, am not part of government mind you. But again, I just believe this is how we start. If I am able to empower one youth, I have achieved. Putting a number to it, may be I can still tell you we have not empowered up to one percent of the population of youths. We still have a lot of work to do because all I am doing now is reaching out to other notable bodies and successful Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon men and women to join to support this kind of gesture.\n\nWhen I get to NASS, my goal is am able in 4 years to empower 40 or 50 percent of out youths.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle\n\nOgun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, officially flagged off women empowerment scheme with disbursement of individual livelihood grants to 2,094 women across the state.\n\nThe governor, who performed the flag-off ceremony at the relaunching of Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in collaboration with Nigeria For Women Project (NFWP) at the MKO Abiola Int\u2019l Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, said women empowerment and emancipation would continue to be at the front burner of his administration.\n\nThe event had the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development; Mrs. Pauline Tallen, wives of the Kwara and Osun State governors, the World Bank Country Director, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, among other dignitaries in attendance.\n\nAbiodun noted that in the economic architecture of his government, the womenfolk form a vital economic bloc, hence, the emplacement of various schemes to empower them, not only financially but economically.\n\nHe said out of estimated 7,535,007 2021 population projection by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), for Ogun State, females are put at 3,788,932, which is 50.28%, saying the significant number of women cannot be overlooked, if the state truly desires sustainable development.\n\nAbiodun, who added that his administration had observed women as mostly involved in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) but always find difficult to access financial resources for the growth of their businesses from conventional financial institutions, said his government had since devised other approaches to empower the womenfolk.\n\nThese, according to him, include \u201ccapacity building of 500 female entrepreneurs across the state to enable them access financing and scale up their businesses; empowerment of 2,500 rural women across the state through provision of products worth \u20a6100m; empowerment of over 600 youths through vocational training while 400 women and youths are still undergoing training at the V\n\nvocation training centre under the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development; empowerment of 95 Women across the three\n\nsenatorial districts and more than 100 widows were also empowered during the commemoration of year 2021 International Widows Day\u201d.\n\nHe emphasised that the empowerment programmes are targeted at alleviating poverty and increasing prosperity of women.\n\n\u201cOur womenfolk are integral part of our financial inclusiveness agenda. We are committed to providing avenues for our women to gain power and control over their own lives and acquire requisite skills and technical know-how to make strategic choices. It is a critical aspect of achieving the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development (SDG) Goal 5 \u2013 Gender Equality. On its own, Gender Equality provides more socioeconomic and political wherewithal for our women.\n\n\u201cAt the macro level, it will go a long way in reducing poverty in the family; reduce gender-based violence and abuse in the society; and, further strengthen the economy. Therefore, empowering our women is not a favour to their gender, it is, in fact, one of the most viable approaches towards achieving sustainable economic development\u201d, the governor added.\n\nWhile commending the Federal Government for the initiative of the Nigeria for Women Projects (NFWP), the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and the World Bank, Abiodun said the choice of Ogun as\n\none of the six states in each of the six geo-political zones of Nigeria for the implementation of the NFWP programme is commendable.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NFWP programme would be extended to other local government areas in Ogun, saying the FG\u2019s scheme is in tandem with Oko\u2019wo Dapo Scheme.\n\nAbiodun stated further that after disbursing the individual grants to women beneficiaries across the three implementing Local Government Areas of Odeda; Ijebu North-East; and, Yewa North, his administration would soon re-launch Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in the remaining 17 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe governor, however, disclosed that some of the beneficiaries of the first phase of Oko\u2019wo Dapo in Odeda LG were at an advanced stage of floating a micro finance bank, which according to him, would further provide for financial inclusiveness for more people and easier access to financial resources to boost their enterprises.\n\nWhile saying the disbursement would be in phases, he enjoined the beneficiaries not to see the financial assistance as their own share of the national cake, but \u201csee it as an avenue for economic empowerment through which they will be gainfully employed, improve their productivity and increase your income-earning capacities, and, expectedly become net employers of labour\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe see the sustainability of this programme as a bilateral responsibility. Government has played its own part by providing the funding, beneficiaries should reciprocate by ensuring that they utilize the funds for the intended purposes, so that it will bring the desired results. Fidelity to this public trust will encourage other Development Partners to collaborate with us on this venture.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to call on well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to come and partner with us and join us in this journey to take Ogun State to a greater and more prosperous heights\u201d, Abiodun submitted.",

          "title": "Terrorism: El-Rufa\u2019i Briefs Buhari, Says North-West States May Resort To Mercenaries",
          "text": "The Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufa\u2019i, has revealed that if the federal government fails to speedily and decisively deal with terrorists, the North-West States of Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto and the neighbouring Niger might resort to hiring mercenaries to end the ongoing reign of terrorists within their states.\n\nEl-Rufai spoke in an interview conducted in the Hausa language at the State House in Abuja on Friday after he visited President Muhammadu Buhari to provide updates and inform him of possible resolve of governors of North-West states.\n\nHe stressed that the devastating attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train last Monday, which claimed eight lives, would have been avoided if the federal government had heeded his earlier warnings.\n\nEl-rufai warned that the terrorists, with the sort of arrogance and boldness they have in recent times operated, will go on to attempt to subdue the nation if the military fail to act proactively by storming their camps and hideouts in the forests and wipe them out once and for all.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe reiterated his earlier stance that security agencies, including the military, are aware of the locations and specific mappings of the terrorists, adding that the President had assured that he would take required actions and the ongoing carnage would be sorted out in a matter of months.\n\nHe revealed that the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train was carried out by Boko Haram elements, contrary to the belief that the terrorists were the same bandits known to have been terrorising the entire North-West in the last few years, adding that the attack was not a hack job, but well planned over a long period.\n\nHe said, \u201cto us, this happened because we have consistently written letters to the Nigerian Railway Corporation. We wrote them twice to stop night trips, because we had security report that Boko Haram had entered and they were planning to blow up the train, they should stop night journey. We wrote them twice, but they didn\u2019t listen.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the Air Force, in response to that security report, went and establish a base at Katari, where helicopters can land and refuel, so that if anything happens, they can quickly respond, but that cannot work at night because some helicopters cannot even fly at night, that is why we advised the Federal Government that the night train should be stopped.\n\n\u201cWe suggested that, the last trip should leave Abuja by 4:00pm, so that they can arrive Kaduna before night falls and same for last trip from Kaduna, but our advice was not taken.\n\n\u201cIt took the security agents over an hour to get to the scene when the attack happened because it was night, it would have been faster in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis attack shows that, it is not the bandits that we are used to, these ones came prepared, they have planned this attack for long, to the extent that they know the first class coach where they will get the big personalities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this is a serious issue that we have been suggesting that, these forests where these people are, we should go there and bomb the forest for everyone in the forest to be be killed. Honestly, if this is not done, this banditry in Niger, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and Sokoto will not end.\n\n\u201cThis thing can consume the entire Nigeria, because the way these people are getting money, the way they boast that they don\u2019t fear authorities, they don\u2019t fear military, I don\u2019t know why up till now, the Nigerian military will not enter these forests and deal with these people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhy do we always wait for them to strike before we go after them, why can\u2019t we go to where they are and kill them? We know where they are. We have the maps as the military know, the policemen know and everyone knows. DSS is giving us report every time; see where Dogo Gide is, see what he is planning. Why is it that, up till now, the security have not gone to kill them, where are our soldiers? Why have they not done it?\n\n\u201cThat is why I have come to see Mr President and also I have said that, if these actions are not taken, it becomes a must for us as governors to take measures to protect our citizens, even if it means we will import mercenaries from outside the country to do it, if our soldiers fail, I swear to God, we will do that. This issue has gotten to an alarming state.\n\n\u201cMr President assured me that, he will take actions and that this thing will be brought to an end within months,\u201d the governor said.\n\nOn the rumour of fresh attacks on Kadun-Abuja highway circulating on the social media, El-Rufai said the rumour was being spread by political opponents and that the government had asked the security to investigate and prosecute them.\n\n\u201cAnyone that spreads false information that subject people to unnecessary fear, has violated the laws of Kaduna state and they will be prosecuted. This is not a political matter, even their own people are being kidnapped and killed, some are wounded and in the hospital, but some people are playing politics with it. We curse them and God will judge them, but before they die for Gid to judge them, we will prosecute them here first,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked whether the attack on the Kaduna Airport and the train were attempt to cripple the economy of Kaduna State, the governor said, \u201cit is certainly an attempt to cripple the economy of Kaduna and that of Northern Nigeria entirely. All these are only happening in the North, it is a disturbing development. All these are happening in Kaduna because people are investing in Kaduna, that is what they want to stop, they want to spoil Kaduna, which is the nerve centre of the North, nerve centre of Nigeria politics.\n\n\u201cSome people say they are doing it because of me, it is not because of me, they want to fight President Muhammadu Buhari, fight our party and fight the North. They want to impoverish us because of the coming election in 2023, but they will not succeed by God\u2019s grace,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the safety of the hostages still in the den of the terrorists, the governor said: \u201csome of the people kidnapped, their families have been contacted, while some others were contacted to inform the families that their loved ones are being taken care off.\n\n\u201cBut, the bandits have not indicated they want ransom, because these ones are not the normal kidnappers that people are used to.

          "text": "The Total Energies AFCON Challenge promotion run by 1xBet has reached its end along with the final match of the competition between Senegal and Egypt. Besides the joy of supporting their favourite national football teams and watching top-quality clashes, 1xBet customers also got the chance to win amazing prizes.\n\nThat chance turned into a reality for some lucky customers from Nigeria. They took part in the Total Energies AFCON Challenge promo at 1xBet and recently got their prizes from the bookmaker.\n\nAdeogun Bankole, from Iyana Ipaja, Lagos, is one of the lucky Nigerians to win at the 1xBet Total Energies AFCON Challenge promo. He\u2019s a long-time customer with numerous bets placed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the $500 won in this 1xBet promotion was the first win in a promotion, apart from regular bet slips. As you can imagine, he was very happy to get the news that he was one of the winners. Adeogun already has plans with the amount won. He\u2019ll buy a bicycle and Android tablet for his daughter before spending the rest with his family and friends.\n\nHis advice for other 1xBet customers that didn\u2019t win promotions so far is to keep on trying. You can never know when luck changes and you\u2019re one of the winners. His experience is the best proof in that direction.\n\nIsong Daniel Akpan, from Port Harcourt, is another winner of the 1xBet Total Energies AFCON Challenge. Unlike Adeogun, he said he only placed around three bets to qualify him for the promotion. Also, he previously took part in another promotion where he won bonus points and it gave him hope a bigger prize could come his way.\n\nSo, imagine his surprise when he got a call from 1xBet letting him know he\u2019s the winner of $10,000 in the Total Energie AFCON Challenge. The plan is to invest a part of the money to improve his life. As for a piece of advice for those that don\u2019t think they can win such promotions, Isong says the ones knowing him personally are already convinced. Some of them already registered an account and use the app. He wants to encourage everyone to give 1xBet a shot and also wishes that he could have a promo code to promote the bookmaker himself.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe stories of the other winners are very similar. Just regular people from Nigeria that decided to give 1xBet a shot and took part in this promotion. While many readers may think it\u2019s impossible to win in such promos with thousands of participants, these people and hundreds of others from previous promotions are living proof that anyone can do it.\n\nSo, create an account with 1xBet and follow them on social media to stay updated with all the promotions and tournaments. You don\u2019t need anything special to win, just to take part in the promos and have a bit of luck. Who knows, maybe someday your name will show up in an article just like this one. It\u2019s all about having the courage to take action and trusting you can be one of the winners!",

          "text": "The Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has expressed strong optimism that the menace of pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft will be brought under control within the next two to three weeks.\n\nThis is as National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) received two ISO certifications namely ISO22301:2019 certification for Business Continuity Management System and ISO9001:2015\n\nfrom RINA Italy, effectively making it the first government institution in Africa to receive the certifications.\n\nThe presentation was done on Friday in Abuja at the headquarters of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd at an event attended by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva, the Chairman of the NNPC Board Mrs Margery Okadigbo; the Group Managing Director of the NNPC Mele Kyari, the Group General Manager NAPIMS Bala Wunti and other senior management staff of the NNPC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGroup managing director/CEO of the NNPC, Mele Kolo Kyari, who revealed this yesterday, in Abuja, said the Nigerian Navy is currently carrying out serious military operations in the Niger Delta to ensure that oil and gas assets are protected.\n\nOil Theft: Nigeria Lost $3.27bn In 14 Months \u2013 Federal Govt\n\nSpeaking at the official presentation of ISO 22301 certifications to the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), and launch of the Electronic Materials Management Solutions (EMMS), Kyari, decried the activities of bandits in the Niger Delta which were vandalising pipelines and stealing crude oil, leading to what he described as the lowest level of production in the history of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said, \u201cEnormous work is going on with security agencies and I am optimistic that within two to three weeks, very measurable outcomes will come up so that our businesses can continue.\n\n\u201cThe Navy is carrying out massive operation to contain oil theft in the Niger Delta as we speak.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC boss further, reiterated that the national oil company will become a fully Limited Liability firm from July 1, 2022.\n\nHe added that from that date, the company will operate in full compliance with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act of 2020.\n\nAccording to Kyari, implementing the Petroleum Induction Act (PIA) means that the operations of the NNPC will be run like a private sector enterprise in order to maximise productivity and profitability.\n\nCommenting on the ISO certifications, the NNPC boss further said: \u201cBusiness Continuity is everything in today\u2019s context. As we speak now, there is massive disruption to our operations as a result of activities of vandals and criminals around our pipelines in the Niger Delta area. This has brought down our production to as low as we have never seen before. Today we are doing less than 1.5 million barrels per day. Simply because some criminals have decided to have some infractions on our pipelines. That clearly is the biggest infraction that we are facing today and this kind of engagement and the certification we have around our systems and processes should be able to respond to this and bring in the best framework possible to contain the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso speaking, the group general manager NAPIMS, Mr Bala Wunti, said the Business Continuity Management Certification will help in ensuring an efficient and effective tracking of inventory in the oil and gas sector, fortify transparent online bidding for clients as well as adequately manage threats and disruptive incidents.\n\nThe minister of state, Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, in his comments, assured Nigerians that the protracted petrol scarcity nightmare will never repeat itself.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSylva said the recent fuel scarcity crisis was a reaction to the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), adding that it indicated that the Act was indeed a good development.\n\nSylva, who was represented by director, Human Resources, Dr. Famous Eseduwo, assured that \u201cNigeria will never experience such kind of petroleum crisis again.\n\nHe further commended NAPIMs for its feat in acquiring the various certifications in the oil and gas solutions.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to assure you that the queues you saw last time will be the last time you will see queues in Nigeria. When you are diagnosed with a problem, and if the right drug is administered, definitely there are going to be reactions. The petroleum queues you saw recently are the reactions of the PIA. And that is to tell you that the PIA is the right Bill for the Nigerian oil and gas industry; and with the capable hands of the GMD and all other supporters, we want to assure Nigerians that things like the petroleum crisis will be a thing of the past as soon as possible.\u201d",

          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka has attacked President Muhammadu Buhari for anointing Iyiola Omisore who is the prime suspect in the murder of late Attorney General, Bola Ige, as National Secretary of the APC.\n\nOmisore was last Saturday elected National Secretary of the ruling APC during its National Convention held at the Eagles Square, Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nSoyinka\u2019s reaction was contained in a statement issued on Saturday, titled: \u201cPerhaps closed files should remain just that-Closed?\u201d\n\nHe said barely three months had passed since the 20th anniversary of the murder of the late Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Bola Ige, an occasion that he utilized to remind Buhari, of a subsisting election pledge.\n\n\u2018That pledge was to re-open the files on the spate of unsolved political assassinations that had plagued the nation in recent decades. Prominent among those cases was that of the Minister of Justice, murdered on his way to take up a prestigious position with the United Nations.\n\n\u201cPresidential response was swift. Buhari ordered the Inspector-General of Police to re-open those files and resume investigations. The nation has patiently awaited even a hint of Work in Progress. Most, I am certain, expect no less than a revaluation of prior investigative efforts. None, to my knowledge, has attempted to rush the Chief of Police and his team into judgment. We all take solace in the knowledge that the wheels of justice grind slowly, but they arrive. Eventually,\u201d he said.\n\nSoyinka said an unusual turn of events has raised questions, as the ruling party, headed by the same President, had just elected as its National Secretary one of the prime suspects of this most notorious of the nation\u2019s unsolved murders.\n\n\u201cNot for a moment does one suggest that mere accusation, even trial, presumes Guilt. More than mere verdict is involved in any trial however. The process of arriving at that ultimate destination \u2013 justice \u2013 is integral to the very concept of democracy and equality under the law. That process is one of the structures of civic education.\n\n\u201cUnresolved till today were quite a number of untidy, even suspect aspects of investigation, prosecution and trials, aspects which revealed improper cell co-habitation by suspects under custody. That this led necessarily to recantations of earlier depositions is not thereby proven, but the fact remains that such U-turns did take place.\n\n\u201cOne was so brazen that it induced a heart attack that proved fatal to the victim\u2019s wife, another Justice \u2013 Mrs. Atinuke Ige. That the prime suspect was privileged in a number of improper ways went beyond mere allegation. Political interventions, including pressure on the judiciary during bail hearings, cannot be denied. A judge under such pressure kept a diary with accusations, pages of which he consigned to friends for safekeeping,\u201d he added.\n\nSoyinka asked: \u201cWith the emergence of the said prime suspect as National Secretary of the Ruling Party, is the Inspector-General of Police equipped to confront political obstacles in a resumption of investigation? Is there any guarantee that the result will see the light of day? How suspect, ab initio, will be the conclusions, given the present political ordering?\n\n\u201cI repeat: we are speaking of blatant, undeniable exercise of political interventions during investigations and the arraignment of suspects. Prior incumbency of the position of National Secretary of a ruling party has demonstrated the potent interventionist clout that can be wielded from that office.\n\n\u201cThe president has personally received, and thus anointed the new incumbent. Since he remains central to any re-investigation \u2013 whatever form or direction it takes \u2013 just what value of objective assessment can be placed on the presidential pledge?\u201d\n\nWith this scenario, the Nobel Laureate said that investigative revisit was already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility.\n\n\u201cI think the nation should simply relieve President Buhari of his pledge. I am certain the Inspector-General of Police will be equally relieved and can now turn his mind and energy to the national accustomed posture \u2013 Business as Usual,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has fostered close ties with Russia and refused to impose sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, is expected to extend his almost 10-year grip on power in the Balkan country when it holds national elections on Sunday.\n\nPolls predict that Vucic, a populist who has boasted about his personal ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, will win another five-year term as president.\n\nHis right-wing Serbian Progressive Party also is expected to continue to dominate the country\u2019s parliament.\n\nBut polls indicated a close local government race in the capital, Belgrade.\n\nA loss for Vucic\u2019s party there could undermine his increasingly autocratic rule.\n\nMost political parties taking part in the presidential, general and municipal elections lean right, reflecting the conservative stands prevalent among Serbia\u2019s 6.5 million voters.\n\nBut a new Green-left coalition campaigning on the need to tackle long-neglected environmental problems also is fielding candidates.\n\nOpposition party officials say Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only strengthened Vucic\u2019s dominance of Serbian politics and the mainstream media.\n\nSoon after Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the president\u2019s election slogan changed to \u201cPeace. Stability. Vucic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe war has diverted public attention from what is happening in Serbia and of course, with media support, enabled Vucic to blame the crisis for everything that is wrong in Serbia,\u201d Dragan Djilas, a leader of the biggest opposition coalition United Serbia, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cArticles are published here every day about how a kilogram of bread costs 9 euros in Italy and Germany, how they have no fuel, how they will have food stamps and how great we are,\u201d Djilas said.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared, and it always suits the authorities because people say, Let\u2019s not change anything now.\u201d\n\nSerbia, a traditional Russian ally, has rejected calls from the European Union and the United States to join in sanctions against Moscow, citing national interests.\n\nThe country\u2019s representative to the United Nations did vote in favour of a resolution condemning Moscow\u2019s attack on Ukraine as a violation of international law.\n\nDespite the Serbian government saying it is seeking EU membership, Vucic and his allies have refrained from condemning Russia over the invasion, a possible sign they want to avoid alienating pro-Russia voters ahead of Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nMuch of the pro-Russia sentiments among Serbs comes from their hatred of NATO; the Western military alliance bombed the country in 1999 to stop a bloody Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo, a Serbian province at the time.\n\nFormer Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said that imposing sanctions on Russia would be tantamount to \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because Moscow has blocked UN membership for Kosovo which declared independence in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf we are ready to give up Kosovo, then we can impose sanctions on Russia,\u201d Dacic said.\n\n\u201cBut if we are not ready, then we cannot.\u201d\n\nThousands of people in Serbia have turned out for pro-Putin rallies during the five-week invasion, waving Russian flags and displaying the letter Z \u2013 a symbol seen on Russian military vehicles in Ukraine.\n\nThe support for Moscow makes Serbia somewhat of an outlier in Europe.\n\nOpposition officials said that despite Vucic\u2019s almost full control of the media and the pro-Russian narrative that has been created leading up to the elections, they expect a good result on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, the situation in Ukraine was very clear. It is about Russian aggression, and we immediately condemned it,\u201d Dobrica Veselinovic, who is running for mayor of Belgrade as the candidate of the environmentalist We Must coalition.\n\nElection polls predict Vucic will win the presidential election outright on Sunday.\n\nIf he does not receive more that 50% of the vote, he would face an unpredictable runoff in two weeks, likely against opposition candidate Zdravko Ponos, a Western-educated former army general.\n\nThe election for National Assembly lawmakers was not scheduled until 2024, but Vucic called an early vote after criticism from the EU that Serbia\u2019s 2020 election had not been free and fair.\n\nThe opposition boycotted that election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any difference between these elections and those two years ago,\u201d political analyst Slobodan Stupar said.\n\n\u201cA parliament will be formed in which Vucic will have fewer lawmakers than now. He will be able to tell Europe, Yes, we are a democratic country. See how many enemies I have in parliament.\u201d",

          "text": "Will Smith, facing possible expulsion or suspension after he assaulted Chris Rock during last Sunday\u2019s Oscars telecast, has instead resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.\n\nThe move comes as the actor is embroiled in the gravest crisis of his career and as the organization behind the Academy Awards has struggled in its attempts to deal with the fallout from the altercation.\n\nIn a statement, Smith called his actions \u201cshocking, painful and inexcusable\u201d and said that he will accept any additional consequences that the Academy\u2019s Board of Governors deems appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cI betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.\u201d\n\nSmith also acknowledged that his actions overshadowed other winners at the 94th Academy Awards.\n\n\u201cI want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film,\u201d he stated, concluding with \u201cchange takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.\u201d\n\nAcademy president David Rubin replied to his resignation, saying in a statement, \u201cWe have received and accepted Mr. Will Smith\u2019s immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy\u2019s Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18.\u201d\n\nDuring the ceremony, Smith charged the stage and struck Rock during the broadcast after Rock made a joke about the actor\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, likening her shaved head to the buzzcut sported by Demi Moore in \u201cG.I. Jane.\u201d Pinkett Smith suffers from hair loss due to alopecia.\n\nThe Academy later said it asked Smith to leave the ceremony and he refused. However, sources say the organization\u2019s leaders never formally requested he be ejected and producer Will Packer urged him to stay.\n\nDuring an appearance on GMA on Friday, Packer said that he said Smith should stay at the request of Rock \u2014 something Rock\u2019s camp has denied.\n\nIt\u2019s a very tangled narrative about what exactly went down behind the scenes. What is certain is that Smith ended up remaining at the Dolby Theatre, where he went on to win best actor for his performance in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional speech, Smith seemed to try to justify his actions by saying that his outburst was the result of the same protective instincts that led his character in the film, Richard Williams, to push his daughters, Venus and Serena Williams, to succeed in the world of tennis.\n\nHis speech, initial failure to apologize to Rock and his decision to attend the Vanity Fair party following the awards did not sit well with some members of the Academy.\n\nOn Monday, Smith finally apologized to Rock, saying, \u201cI was out of line and I was wrong.\u201d He added that he reacted emotionally because \u201ca joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear.\u201d\n\nAfter initially offering up a statement that said it did not condone violence, the Academy followed up with two subsequent statements that more forcefully criticized Smith.\n\nOn Wednesday, the group said Smith had violated the Academy\u2019s standards of conduct and that he had 15 days to provide a written response explaining his actions. The organization said Smith faced suspension, expulsion or other sanctions.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed the readiness of Nigeria to lead the digital technology aspiration of the 54 African countries.\n\nThis is just as Microsoft opened its first engineering hub, the African Development Centre worth $200 million, in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking Friday at the State House, Abuja, while playing host to the President of Microsoft Corporation, Brad Smith, accompanied by the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, the President said Nigeria \u201cis ready to welcome more initiatives and investments in digital technology,\u201d while appreciating Microsoft for an engineering hub, worth $200 million.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI have been informed that the African Development Centre in Nigeria is Microsoft\u2019s first engineering hub in Africa as the current investment stands at about $200 million.\n\n\u201cI have also been informed of Microsoft\u2019s skilling initiative that aims to train five million citizens and provide 27,000 jobs over the next three years. These initiatives are commendable and I urge you to expand them and continue to prioritise Nigeria as you roll out your global initiatives.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the visiting Microsoft team that as the largest economy and most populous country in Africa, Nigeria was positioned to play a strategic role in the global technology ecosystem and seek the right partnerships to harness the potentials.\n\nHe said one of such key partnerships was in the area of capacity building. According to him, his administration has shown great commitment to providing a conducive environment for investors and Nigeria\u2019s massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking was a proof that the efforts were yielding positive results.\n\nThe Nigerian President said: \u201cOur emphasis on the development of our Digital Economy has also positioned the sector as a prominent factor in the Nigerian economy. As the fastest growing sector of the Nigerian economy in 2020, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a very important role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are keen about building on the momentum as we continue to implement our National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy, along with other related policies.\u201d\n\nApart from partnership in the area of skills building, President Buhari said he looked forward to further partnerships that would support the digital infrastructure and innovation ecosystem, with regard to emerging technologies: \u201cI believe that this meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss how the Nigerian government can support the growth of your business here and how Microsoft can contribute to the growth of our economy through the active support of our policies and programmes.\u201d\n\nBuhari said he launched the Nigerian National Broadband Plan on the 19th of March 2020, with the aim of expanding broadband access across Nigeria and Microsoft\u2019s connectivity initiative aligns with the plan.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe it would be very useful and mutually beneficial to both Microsoft and Nigeria if your connectivity project is expanded beyond the current four locations in this country.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies play a key role in digital transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a number of indigenous companies have developed very useful solutions. We are willing to partner with Microsoft to make Nigeria the epicenter for innovative emerging technology in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe President commended the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and all industry stakeholders for their support for the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to sustain the momentum, I further direct that you and other stakeholders in the technology ecosystem keep the government fully informed of your ongoing and proposed activities that support the growth of our digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe have the potential of becoming your most lucrative market in Africa. As such, we urge you to continue to support the development of our digital economy. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support for Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria and on the African continent.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said he represented President Buhari at the inauguration of the African Development Centre, adding that Microsoft had over 200 Nigerians working for them in Nigeria and in Seattle.\n\nPantami noted that 320,000 Nigerians had also been trained on digital skills by the technology company.\n\nOn his part, the President of Microsoft and Vice Executive Chairman said the company would keep creating jobs to help build technology that would change the world, noting that the \u201cmulti-tasking approach\u201d also stretches to digital infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe pledge to train five million people in Nigeria in the future,\u201d Smith said, noting \u201c60,000 people had already enrolled for courses while 300,000 had completed various courses,\u201d said the\u2019 Microsoft President.\n\nSmith said the company had gone into partnership with other companies to increase Internet and broadband penetration, while efforts had been advanced in innovating technology that would fight corruption and preserve cultural heritages, like languages.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
