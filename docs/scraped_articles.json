          "title": "Why I want to be Delta Governor in 2023 \u2014 Goodnews Agbi",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Henry Umoru, Assistant Political Editor\n\nFormer chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr Goodnews Agbi has joined the 2023 Delta State Gubernatorial race on the platform of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP.\n\nAgbi who hails from Oyede, Isoko Local Government Area of Delta state has vowed that with the new NNPP, they are prepared to fight the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and the All Progressives Congress, APC with a view to breaking the dynasty in the state.\n\nThe aspirant who is a lecturer in the Department of Engineering, Delta State University, alleged that Delta had not witnessed any meaningful development or progress since the members of the Ibori political dynasty had been ruling the oil-rich state.\n\nDr Agbi who has been very active in Delta State politics since he joined in 1998, contested the governorship primaries of the defunct Grassroots Democratic Party, GDM, with Chief James Ibori who later became the Governor of Delta State as his only opponent. He also contested the PDP Governorship primaries in 2007, which were won by former Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan.\n\nAgbi was the pioneer Deputy Chairman of the National Youths Mobilization of PDP in 1998/ 1999, just as he was also a National Election Committee member of the PDP that conducted the primaries in Abia that returned former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu in 1998/ 1999. But he finally dumped the PDP for the APC in 2014.\n\nIn this interview, Agbi spoke on his Gubernatorial aspiration, his blueprint for Delta State, on the nomination of Anthony Alabi, his co-plaintiff in the celebrated criminal case against former Governor James Onanefe Ibori as his deputy, among others.\n\nEXCERPTS:\n\nWhy are you contesting for the Gubernatorial race in Delta come 2023 Delta election?\n\nOf course you will agree with me that I am eminently qualified as a Deltan to contest for the governorship. I have the minimum qualifications. My primary and secondary schools are in existence, the results are with me and available.\n\nHaving said that about my eligibility, the other motivation is the desire to make a change. Delta is becoming a State ruled by Chiefdoms, who pass the baton of sub authority from one subordinate headman to another under the imposing pseudo democratic dictator. All the over 7 trillion Naira Delta has earned from 1999 to date has been frittered without any legacy project in the State.\n\nPlease name one project that you can point finger to that is in Asaba or Warri or elsewhere in the State for that huge money earned. Deltans must rise up to challenge these crop of people to stop further laceration of the financial bleeding of the State. Every lover of the State will want to join me to offer credible alternative to the leadership structure of the state.\n\nWe have to change the narratives, all Deltans aaAmust enjoy, feel or taste the riches of the State and not for only the few leaders of the PDP exclusive club. We must all rise up together to effect this change in 2023. That is why Iam contesting to right the injustices to the Delta People.\n\nDo you have the Political Structure to achieve this?\n\nThe platform Iam using is relatively new. The NNPP, though it has been in existence in the country for some time now, it is still behind PDP and APC in terms of mobilization. We are not oblivious of the Herculean task ahead of us, but we are soldiering on. We are offering a new direction hence we are soliciting the supports of Deltans to vote out the PDP and the APC. We are doing serious sensitization and mobilization, but we are also waiting on the INEC time table to commence serious campaigns. That not withstanding, we have structures in all the local governments and wards. We urge Deltans to vote for individual and not parties. The APC and PDP have only gifted the people with miseries, suffering and pains. Deltans must rise up to the change their situations by voting out these people.\n\nWe are aware they have stockpiled money, including borrowing more money to prosecute the elections. We are not afraid of their money power. To confront these daunting challenges, we have set up a trust fund, \u2018Agbi governorship campaign fund\u2019 for the election. This notwithstanding, we urge all Deltans to rise to the challenge and take their Destiny in their hands in 2023. They cannot fold their hands and be onlookers in their State when a small band of opportunists are eating away their destiny and that of their children and children children.\n\nWhy did you choose Anthony Alabi as your running mate?\n\nOver the years, he has shown himself to be trusted, focused and tested individual who could be a veritable partner in the struggle to change the status quo. Nigerians in general and Delta in particular are beginning to value integrity. Deltans would want to vote for somebody they can trust. People that can be entrusted with the State treasury. Alabi and I would form a perfect team with absolute moral rectitude, persons who would not scurry the State resources into salacious wastage abroad and within without investing them in Delta State. He is somebody, if elected I can delegate duties without fear of pecuniary infractions. The vault of Delta State and financial inflows is tempting to those with itching fingers\n\nYou were reported to have said that you will merge the Universities in Delta if elected as the governor in 2023, what would it portend to the state?\n\nWe are going to undertake total reforms of the Educational Sector. To achieve this you will need to plug all leakages. The scale of pilfering, over invoicing and underperformance is humongous. All the State earnings will be judiciously utilized if voted into power. One of the areas we shall channel these savings to is Education. Why should an indigene of Delta State be paying around two hundred and fifty thousand for school fees in a State University of a rich State like Delta? Why are we creating more Universities whereas the existing ones are ill equipped?\n\nSome of the Campuses of the Delta State University are still at their original state when the university was established. No improvement. No standard equipment. Lecturers are not employed because of paucity of funds. Come to Oleh campus for example, the engineering faculty has laboratories that are only laboratory by name, no functional equipment, shortage of manpower are part of the ailments bedeviling the campus. Lecturers offices are an eyesore, lecture halls appalling.\n\nThe Engineering lecturers are working under unprofessional atmosphere with shortage of Staff while engineering and laboratory tests are taken outside the campus for tests. The law faculty is no difference, it is even worse off. Visit the hostels and you will cry for your children. Yet with all this inadequacies, a government will go on and create more universities.\n\nIf I am elected, I will turn the three State Universities into citadels of learning. I will reduce the burden of school fees on the parents to the barest minimum while employing quality lecturers and other academic Staff. The laboratories, especially that of the engineering will be stocked with up to date equipment.\n\nTo achieve these noble intentions, we must merge. We cannot sacrifice the destinies of our children on the alter of political expediency. I will merge the existing Universities campuses into the three Senatorial districts of Delta State, that is, Delta State University Abraka will have all the faculties in Abraka, with the Engineering and Law established in Abraka or its environs all in Delta Delta Central.\n\nFor Delta North, Owa Alero/Agbor will merge with Asaba complete with all the faculties. For Delta South, the two Campuses In Oleh will merge with Delta State University of Science and Technology at Ozoro with one administration. All the three Universities will offer all professional courses, including medicines with their own teaching hospitals, engineering, Architecture, Phamacy, accountancy, sciences etc.\n\nSimilarly the three Polytechnics in the three Senatorial areas will be sustained and maintained. The former State Polytechnic at Ozoro in Isoko will be brought back to Isoko.\n\nUrhobo Voice: As a foremost lecturer in one of the higher institution in the state, what are your plans to effectively transform the educational sector if elected as Delta governor come 2023 ?\n\nYou were reported to have said that Delta is a rich state, but has been unfortunate to have serial incompetent leaders. How do you substantiate this?\n\nThe statement is self explanatory. Is there any doubt about that? Tell me one competent leader Delta has produced? Let us tell ourselves the truth, which of the past governors of the PDP has done any legacy projects commensurate with volumes of funds the State has received. None. Warri and its environs is pathetic. Asaba is artificial flood zone. Vehicles become canoes when there is heavy rain. What they are known for is using Delta State money to fund Presidential candidates. Just personal aggrandizement. No people oriented policies or projects.\n\nThey are ardent at amassing and pilfering our resources to buy big cars and property at home and abroad. They are contented with ostentatiously licentious living, leaving the people in abject penury in the midsts of plenty. Is that not incompetency\n\nYour take Akwa Ibom State with functional Airline, over six Aircraft and none in Delta State. How will you replicate such in Akwa Ibom State if elected as governor in 2023.?\n\nYou can get money to execute projects like the Airline business if you stop stealing the people\u2019s resources. If the head or those close to the head are stealing you cannot stop others from stealing. If you can stop the stealing money will be available for mega legacy projects. If elected I will lead by example. Those around me will see my body language and will not loot. For example, at 62years I don\u2019t want and will not buy house or houses in Lagos, Abuja or abroad. What for?\n\nIam contented with my one house in my town in Oyede. Iam contented with the bungalow I have at Oleh. If I travel to Abuja or Lagos or abroad for meeting, I will return immediately after the meeting to my country home. Yes I can go on holiday, say once in a year and come back home. I don\u2019t even want to build a house in Asaba during my tenure. Look I always reflect on the brevity of life and will not stress myself amassing property that, after leaving government house, the stress of maintaining and thinking about them will lead to your early demise. I love a low profile life, not this fake lifestyles exhibited by politicians.\n\nSo anybody working with me or around me will not try stealing the people\u2019s money. It is then possible to save enough from the blocked leakages to embark on Airline, shipping and other investments that would continue to yield dividends for the State.\n\nAhead of 2023 Governorship election, your message to the people of Delta State.\n\nMy message to Deltans is that they should vote for the individual, not the party, tribe or region. At the end, if you vote your brother who is wayward, you will still not see the dividends of the prosperity of your State. Iam encouraged that people are responding to our clarion call. Iam bringing my self to you all Deltans, as an individual who wants to make a difference in our lives, the lives of our children and our grandchildren. We should vote out our oppressors in 2023.\n\nThe people of Delta State should go and get their PVCs and vote right. Don\u2019t vote PDP or APC. Don\u2019t vote party. Don\u2019t vote cleavages. Vote personality that can change our lives. Iam happy about the rush to get PVC. This shows we are ready to take our destiny in our hands.These large numbers don\u2019t belong to any party. They just want change. Again vote that individual that can lead us out of this bondage.\n\nIt is very electric and encouragingly gratifying. They see us as a total departure from the corrupt production line of governorship candidates. One thing is obvious from the rush to get PVC. Deltans are tired of having the same political actors striding the political space including their godfathers and godsons. They want a change.\n\nI am that change. Iam so confident that these myriads of Deltans thronging to get their PVCs are not party members. They are not APC or the disjointed and dying PDP members; they are the determined Deltans seeking for a healthy change that I represent. The large crowd at PVC registration centers are waiting for 2023 to vote in a good manager of their resources, to vote Dr Agbi in as the governor of Delta State.",

As mothers, we should be watchful and careful on who comes in contact with our children, even the infants at home.\n\n\u201cIn my office, I receive cases of rape of infants even done by close family members and those supposed to protect the child. As mothers, nature has endowed us with the power and wisdom to protect our children.\u201d\n\nDr George Ugwu, Executive Secretary, Enugu State Primary Health Care Development Agency (ENS-PHCDA), said that the programme was being carried out twice yearly under the guidance of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA).\n\nUgwu said that it was being carried out in conjunction with the state\u2019s development partners \u2013 WHO, UNICEF and the state governor\u2019s wife foundation, Ugo Touch of Life Foundation (U-TOLF) \u2013 among others.\n\nHe said that in the programme, essential health services and commodities would be distributed free in all communities, villages and hamlets using the over 676 health facilities and outposts where routine immunisations take place.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have trained 2,200 health workers to deliver the services for the programme.\n\n\u201cDuring the programme, women and children will be given health education, pre-natal vitamin A, other multivitamins, routine immunisation, family planning commodities and COVID-19 vaccination among others.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy that this year\u2019s first round of the programme is commencing early in the year and, as an Agency, we are prepared to offer this service in an optimised and integrated manner.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary expressed gratitude \u201cto caring and health loving governor, Chief Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, for always providing us with all the enablement and necessary support.\n\n\u201cENS-PHCDA appreciates the wife of our governor, Mrs Monica Ugwuanyi, for her care, love, guidance and support as well as U-TOLF\u2019s continuous support loads of free drugs, multivitamins and health consumables each time we have this programme.\u201d\n\nIn a goodwill message, the Chairman, Enugu Assembly Committee on Health, Chief Sam Ngene, commended Gov.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Prince Okafor\n\nMore troubles in the aviation industry, as the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) announced the suspension of Dana Airlines\u2019 Air Transport Licence (ATL) and Air Operator Certificate (AOC) indefinitely, with effect from midnight of Wednesday, 20th July, 2022.\n\nAccording to the authority, the suspension was made pursuant to Section 35(2), 3(b) and (4) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3(a)(1) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs), 2015.\n\nThe suspension order, handed down by the Director General, Captain Musa Nuhu, has since been communicated to the management of Dana Airlines.\n\nNuhu notes that, \u201cThe decision is the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the Airline by the Authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the Airline\u2019s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA acknowledges the negative effect this preemptive decision will have on the Airline\u2019s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding, as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that Nigeria\u2019s oldest airline, Aero contractors also suspended its passenger flight operations indefinitely from today.\n\nVanguard had reported that the company, stated that the suspension of its operations was due to the impact of the challenging operating environment on its daily operations.\n\nIn a reaction to the development, Aviation Analyst, Mr. Olumide Ohunayo, stated that, \u201cAero Contractors is the oldest airline in Nigeria and also the most successful in the non-scheduled operation services before they ventured into schedule operations, and since then they have been struggling to break through the bridges of operations couple the buy over by the Ibru family and then professionalism began to erode the company, coupled with mismanagement.\n\n\u201cThe company have maintained a perfect safety record, they went into aircraft and maintenance had a succession in viable maintenance organization, they have a standard and well-equipped training school.\n\n\u201cAs a company, they felt like rather than lose it all, they had to suspend a section of the business.

I imagine that no government will create Institutions with the intention of depriving them of attention or resources.\u201d\n\nIn a statement yesterday by his Special Adviser, Media Ola Awoniyi, the President of the Senate further said, \u201cI\u2019m sure, sometimes, government gets into a situation where the resources may simply not be sufficient to go round and therefore everywhere will be like everybody should have something to survive.\n\n\u201cThat places some burden on the Institutions because it means the Institutions must have to be creative and innovative on their internally generated revenues.\n\n\u201cBut I understand that even to generate revenues, you have people who will be there in the colleges and if you have dwindling enrollment situations, that makes it worse because it means you cannot have much from the students who will be enrolled and that leaves the Institutions, especially the colleges of education in a very challenging situation.\n\n\u201cI know that our tertiary Institutions across board face this kind of situation. I imagine that we just have to re-priotise as we face challenges even as families, we re-priotise our scale of preference.\n\n\u201cAs a parliament, ours is to ensure that our colleges of education get the right attention, get the appropriate resources so that you are able to run the affairs of your Institutions well.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is to engage better with our committees before budget and during budget.\n\n\u201cWe will try to see how our colleges of education will attract students because when you go through the priority scale, most of our youths will indicate preference for University\u2026That explains why the enrollment situation in colleges of education is bad because it\u2019s usually the last resort.\n\n\u201cWe should have our colleges of education becoming top choice for our students.\n\n\u201cIf we have to reverse the present trend, it means we have to review even what we teach in most of our Institutions\u2026The colleges of education can produce fantastic, not only teachers but researchers as well and that can make them contribute very meaningfully to the development of the country.\u201d",

          "text": "Youths of Ovogovo in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, under the auspices of United Ovogovo Youth Forum (UOYF), have described Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as a manager of human and material resources, who assumed office as governor at the most difficult time in the socio-economic life of the country but changed the tide in the state positively with numerous development projects and people-oriented programmes.\n\nOvogovo youths also described Gov. Ugwuanyi as a man of peace, wisdom and vision, who saw the need to develop young people so that they can play their societal role as leaders of tomorrow.\n\nThey commended Gov. Ugwuanyi for the peaceful and successful conduct of the party primary elections in Enugu State ahead of the 2023 general elections, pledged their unalloyed loyalty and support to the governor towards his bid to represent Enugu North Senatorial District in the National Assembly, assuring that they are solidly behind him.\n\nSpeaking when they paid a solidarity visit to the governor at the Government House, Enugu, the Director General of United Ovogovo Youth Forum, Hon. Chimaobi Ezema, maintained that the governor\u2019s achievements in office in spite of the state\u2019s lean resources and harsh economic realities in the country are remarkable and worthy of commendation.\n\nStressing that governance in Nigeria in the last seven years has been quite challenging, Hon. Ezema, on behalf of the group, applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for the newly constructed state-of-the- art Flyover Bridge at T-junction, Nike Lake Road, Enugu, which has eased traffic congestion in the area and shortened movement time from Nsukka to Enugu.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we thank you for all you have done for Enugu State and Nsukka people in particular. We left Nsukka for Enugu for this visit around 11am and we are here in Enugu before 12noon unlike in the past when there was gridlock at the T-junction and we do spend over three hours there.\n\n\u201cThat Flyover Bridge your administration constructed has reversed the case for road users and we are very grateful for this landmark project. This is just one of the numerous projects you did in Enugu, Nsukka, and for our people in the rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell you that we are proud of you. We are satisfied with what you have achieved so far with the state\u2019s lean resources, despite numerous challenges our country is facing\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso speaking, a former Councilor, Rt. Hon. Henry Ikah, stressed that Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s achievements are countless and lauded him for constructing the hitherto abandoned Opi-Nsukka dual carriageway, with underground drainage system, which he said is \u201cas deep as the height of a Two-storey building\u201d.\n\nRt. Hon. Ikah equally hailed the governor for the construction of the 5,000-seat capacity Township Stadium at Nsukka, Type-3 hospitals across the state and other numerous development projects with the state\u2019s meager resources.\n\nHis words: \u201cYour Excellency, we are not ignorant of the fact that the resources available for governance in Enugu State is not up to one-third of the cost of the projects you have done and still doing in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are also not ignorant of the hardship occasioned by the nation\u2019s economic meltdown, COVID-19 and other challenges at the national level.\n\n\u201cSince then, you have kept Enugu State peaceful and everything is moving on smoothly as if to say there is a magic you are doing. It is not magic but because you entrusted Enugu State to the hands of God.\n\n\u201cOvogovo has 62 percent of the votes in Nsukka LGA. Roads you have constructed in Enugu, Nsukka and rural areas are countless. The Opi-Nsukka road which you constructed with underground drainage, very deep that it could swallow a Two-storey building is one of the landmark projects every Nsukka person will be proud of and commend you. We are also proud of you for the new Medical University you established in Nsukka and the Federal Polytechnic you brought to Nsukka, among numerous others. Thank you sir\u201d.\n\nOther speakers, including the Leader of Nsukka Legislative Council, Rt. Hon. Jude Omeje, the Coordinator of Serving Councilors in Nsukka, Hon. Chidi Okoro and the group\u2019s Woman Mobilizer, Joy Amuche Omeje, all thanked Gov. Ugwuanyi for his administration\u2019s modest achievements in Enugu State in spite of the nation\u2019s challenges and his massive transformation of the University town of Nsukka in keeping with his 2015 inaugural address, stressing that they are solidly behind the governor and his senatorial bid in 2023.",

          "title": "Presidential election must win for APC \u2013Tinubu",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Fred Itua, Abuja, Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nIn spite of stiff opposition, particularly from the Christian community over his decision to hoist a Muslim-Muslim flag, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has boasted that the ruling party would win the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nHe made the declaration at the unveiling of his running mate, and former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe hinged the desperation to win the presidential poll on the opportunity to reposition the country in agriculture, education, health and infrastructures.\n\nDefending his choice of running mate, the former Lagos State governor emphasised that Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond showed that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver the all important electoral victory, but also step into the shoes of the vice president.\n\n\u201cEvery election brings with it the promise of renewed hope. This one shall be no different. For our party and for our nation, we hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before. To do this, we must be wise of thought and courageous of action. We must win this election so that we can bring jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to the people of this country.\u201d\n\nHe thanked all APC members and supporters for the outpouring of support he had received in the weeks since his nomination by the party.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to make this journey and, today, I am delighted to stand shoulder to shoulder with my good friend, brother and running mate; Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\n\u201cMuch has been said and written about my decision to select Senator Shettima to partner me on this journey. As a committed democrat and progressive, I have read and listened to all that has been written and said. It has been an emotional and moving period. I understand the strength of feeling that has been displayed by some within our party and I cherish and respect the views of all.\n\n\u201cYet, I remain steadfast in my belief in the selection of Senator Shettima. I am unwavering in my belief that is the very best person to run for office and to, hopefully, govern by my side.\n\n\u201cI believe in the project this party embarked on at the moment of its foundation. I believe our diversity is our strength and I believe that we must be victorious in order to achieve the greatness of which this country is capable.\n\n\u201cAll my life, my decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cIn politics, these principles are sacrosanct. Without them there can be neither victory nor good governance. I seek both. I applied them as Governor of Lagos. I apply them again now.\n\n\u201cThis chapter in our nation\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach. In selecting Senator Shettima I have committed myself to this path. I have made the hard choice because I believe it is the best choice.\n\n\u201cThis is where politics must end and leadership must begin. True leadership is not grounded in religion, populism or sentiment. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds.\n\n\u201cShettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the Vice President. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith,\u201d he said in defence of his choice of Shettima.\n\nMeanwhile, South East stakeholders including two governors, former ministers like Ogbonnaya Onu, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Chris Ngige, and even former Senate President, Ken Nnamani were conspicuously absent at the ceremony.\n\nAlso, chieftains and leaders of the party from the South-south notably Rotimi Amaechi, Governor Ben Ayade, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege among others were equally missing at the event.\n\nThose in attendance included members of the national leadership like Deputy National Chairman (South), Emma Enukwu, National Welfare Secretary, FN Nwosu, former National Organizing Secretary, Emma Ibediro, Director-General Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu among others.\n\nHowever, while dignitaries gathered at the venue of the unveiling, protesters, numbering hundreds, were at the national secretariat of the party to demand that APC reverse its decision on Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe protesters were to converge on the venue of the unveiling, but got security report of a possible clash with supporters of the ticket, which made them to divert to the party\u2019s national secretariat to register their disapproval.\n\nThe demonstration led by members under the auspices of APC Hausa-Fulani Youth Forum arrived the secretariat in six luxury buses and few cars holding different banners and chanting solidarity songs.\n\nSome of the banners read: \u2018A cry for justice\u2019, \u2018Drop Shettima and give slot to our Christian brothers\u2019, \u2018Discrimination and mutual suspicion in our country\u2019, \u2018Muslim-Muslim ticket will deny APC victory\u2019 among others.\n\nConvener of Forum, Abdullahi Bilal Mohamadu, who spoke to newsmen, warned that they would not stop protesting until the party do the right.\n\nAsked why they chose to protest on a day the party was unveiling him, Mohammadu said it was a deliberate act to tender their grievances and ensure it reached the appropriate authorities.\n\n\u201cWe write to your good office in light of the prevailing circumstances arising from the decision of our Presidential candidate to select a Northern Muslim as his vice presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile it must be stated that there is a right to make decisions, such decisions must not be made to the collective detriment of the sensibilities of the people that make up the country, especially at a time of mutual suspicion amongst Christians and Muslims in the northern part.\n\n\u201cAs concerned stakeholders of the APC and those who constitute the voting strength of our party, we find it worrisome that such a decision could be taken without recourse to its implication on the electoral chances of the party and the attendant uproar such a decision could bring about in the country.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this is insensitive and a gross display of a lack of respect for our Christian brothers and sisters especially the Middle Belt minority who have given all their best to us as one northern Nigeria. Picking another Muslim from the North Eastern part of the country as his running mate is politically and morally indefensible.\n\n\u201cIn Northern Nigeria, there are credible candidates with rich credentials and with massive grassroots following that can complement the presidential ticket of the APC in the presidential elections. As such, the Hausa- Fulani Youths Forum sees the selection of Senator Shettima as an aberration that should be corrected with immediate effect by the relevant authorities within the party.\n\n\u201cThe implication of non-action can only be imagined, so much so that the majority of the eligible voters in Northern Nigeria have elected to boycott the APC in protest of the disrespect and disregard to our Northern Christian brothers, whose population and relevance in the scheme of things in the region cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\u201cIf our party is desirous of recording electoral success in the 2023 presidential elections, it must retrace its steps by selecting a Christian from the Middle Belt as its vice presidential candidate. The party must not be perceived as promoting a religious agenda by fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\u201d\n\n\u2022Loss in Osun lesson to party members \u2013Support group\n\nSupporters on the platform of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu National Canvassers (BATNC) have said the loss in Osun State is a lesson.\n\nPresident of the support group, Murtala Muhammad Garba, urged supporters to get their permanent voters\u2019 card.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must be able to represent our candidate, anywhere, anywhere, anytime in this country and outside. Let the electorate know that our candidate is a good example of good governance.\n\n\u201cHe has been doing it and he will do more if given the opportunity to govern. He has a road map. He lives in Nigeria and his businesses are here too in the country.\n\n\u201cHe believes in empowerment of youth and women. He participated and contributed to many developmental projects within the country. Let out campaign convince the electorate out there.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Osun State is a big lesson to all support groups and party loyalists. Let us build bridges and not walls. The time of box snatching is gone.\n\n\u201cElectorate now vote for individuals and not party. We need to defend the reason for the reason for the emergence of a Muslim as Vice President \u201c\n\n\u2022Buhari: Tinubu/Shettima ticket\u2019ll emerge victorious\n\nPresident Buhari has predicted that Tinubu and Shettima, would win the 2023 poll.\n\nMalam Garba Shehu, president\u2019s spokesman, said Buhari made the prediction when he received Sen. Shettima, at the State House, Abuja.\n\nShehu said the president struck a chord of humour while responding to a flowery speech by Shettima, saying, \u201cI will respond to your speech when I am handing over to you and your boss. God willing, you are going to win.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari, who received Shettima shortly after he was unveiled by the leadership of the party and Tinubu, expressed delight over the choice of the former Governor of Borno as running mate.\n\n\u201cI wish you the best. Your consistency in the party is very respectful. You served your two terms as Governor and finished well.\n\n\u201cYou have kept touch with your base. At every important occasion or event, you are maintaining support for the one who succeeded you. This is commendable\u201d.\n\nThe president expressed strong optimism that the APC ticket would emerge victorious in 2023.\n\nShetima thanked the president for his \u201cempathy, support and positive role,\u201d leading to his emergence as running mate to the APC Presidential Candidate.\n\nHe praised the president for having \u201ca special place in your heart for Borno and North East.\n\n\u201cI can cite 20-30 instances of support you have rendered, for which you will be remembered.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the North East Development Commission (NEDC) and the Independent Power Plant for Maiduguri by the NNPC, \u201cafter many years of darkness.\u201d\n\n\u2022Tinubu has chosen to walk along Abiola\u2019s path \u2013Adamu\n\nSenator Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman, said Tinubu has chosen to walk along the path of great Nigerians like the late MKO Abiola in picking Shettima as running mate.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the APC to step out to the public space with one of its best. Since the presidential candidate of our party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, announced the choice of his running mate on July 11, the nation is yet to know who he is, we welcome this opportunity to unveil him.\n\n\u201cAs the national chairman of our party, it is both my honour and duty to unveil this distinguished son of our country and formally present him to this august body and through it, the Nigerian public,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu said that the late MKO Abiola in 1993 presidential election, chosed a Kanuri man, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe from the North-East as his running mate.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to suspect there must be some synergy between the Yoruba people and the Kanuri people.\n\n\u201cMaybe there is a mutual attraction between them that the rest of us do not know, never mind, we will put the searchlight on them,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the 1993 MKO Abiola-Kingibe presidential ticket and the current Tinubu-Shettima ticket, bridged one of our fault lines in the management of our diversities.\n\nAdamu said Nigerians overwhelmingly voted for that ticket because they trusted Abiola, a man who opened his arms to every tribe and religion in the country to run an inclusive government.\n\nHe said that Tinubu was a man who has also thrown his arms around every tribe in the country and has offered his shoulders for those in pains to lean on.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has declared as unlawful, the street protest planned by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in solidarity with striking members of university-based unions.\n\nNLC had announced that it would embark on a nationwide protest on July 26 and 27 to compel government to resolve the over five-month-old strike that has kept students in public universities at home.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government, yesterday, claimed the planned protest was a plot by the NLC to create anarchy in the country describing it as illegal.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who briefed State House Correspondents after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, claimed the NLC was taking sides with ASUU and acting as a political party.\n\nHe queried the right of the union to embark on the protest when it had no industrial dispute with the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe NLC is not a political party; the NLC can go on strike or protest if the rights of NLC members are involved. What the NLC is planning in the next two days is about interest. There\u2019s no dispute whatsoever between NLC as a body with the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nMohammed, however, acknowledge that there were disputes between ASUU and some members of the NLC with the Federal Government, and for which a team, which has NLC as members, was set up to resolve.\n\n\u201cSo, calling out people on street protest, you begin to wonder what is the motive of NLC in this matter? But you see here, we do not interrogate what NLC is doing. NLC by its own laws cannot even give out pamphlets. And NLC is supposed to be completely insulated from politics. Now, if you declare dispute with us, yes you can go on strike. Even that one would depend on whether certain steps have been taken or not. But this particular NLC asking and mobilising people to come out on strike on July 26 and 27 is clearly on nothing.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the prolonged strike had grounded academic activities in universities and was affecting NLC children as well, the minister said government was equally worried, but that rather than call out a mass protest, the NLC should partner in finding solution to the crisis.\n\n\u201cThey are part of the tripartite agreement that have been negotiating with the Federal Government on this ASUU issue. So, why are they now going out to take sides? How does that solve the problem? What you are going to create is more anarchy. And I think the NLC should think twice about their proposed strike in solidarity with ASUU.\u201d\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika also expressed concerns with plans by aviation sector unions to shut the airspace. He said grounding aviation sector assets as planned by the unions would compromise safety and security of air travellers and the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m naturally concerned about this if the aviation union will shut down in support of ASUU. I would say they have no need to\u2026 this is democracy, you can push for demands but in pressing for demands you should be reasonable in doing so. So, civil aviation workers, I think should not be part of this. Yes, I am concerned and yes we\u2019ve spoken to them and I don\u2019t think they will join because they know that there\u2019s huge responsibility of lives on their heads. If you\u2019re an air traffic controller, it involves national security, it involves the capability of preventing external aggression and so on so forth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has denied reports that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered him on Tuesday to hands off negotiations with the striking lecturers.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I saw one of the dailies writing something like that today, but the truth of the matter is there is no such thing, it\u2019s just categorically untrue. There is nothing like hands-off,\u201d he told journalists.\n\nAsked if the two weeks directive by the president to resolve the issue is achievable, Ngige said he had proposed one week but Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, volunteered to resolve the issues with ASUU in two weeks.\n\nNgige, who said he had recused himself from further negotiations on crisis in public universities advised the unions to table their case before the Ministry of Education who the president has directed to resolve their issues, adding adding that he hopes all the issues would be resolved at the stipulated time given by Adamu.\n\n. NANS directs all students to join nationwide protest\n\nNational Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), has thrown its weight behind next Tuesday and Wednesday\u2019s protest by the NLC over the prolonged strike by university workers.\n\nNANS said since its protest did not yield the expected result, it would be wise for its members to join the NLC protest to compel the government take action to resolve its dispute with ASUU.\n\nIt commended the national leadership of the NLC for its steadfastness and commitment to join forces with well meaning Nigerians to advocate the end of the protracted ASUU strike.\n\nNANS President, Sunday Asefon, in a statement, yesterday, directed all NANS structures across the country to mobilise and ensure that the NLC protest was a success.\n\nHe said NANS would mobilise students to the protest sites and would act based on directives by the NLC on the protest.\n\nHe said NANS structures across the country would submit to the leadership of NLC all through the protest.\n\n\u201cWhile NANS has organised various protests in the past with no substantial results, also our advocacy and consultations have not yielded desirable results. we have activated political solution and we are very hopeful that an end is in the purview.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are in total support of the planned protest by NLC as we believe this will stem up the advocacy and assist, significantly, to put adequate pressure on the Federal Government to do all that is required to stop the ASUU strike.\u201d",

In addition to the tabs, he said Teesas would also provide internet access for the kids for one year, while officials of the company would be visiting the orphange home every month to put the kids through usage and help them in the maintenance of the devices.\n\nA recent Voice of America report, Rahama Farah, the head of the UNICEF office in Kano, said that in Nigeria, there are 18.5 million out-of-school children, 60 per cent of whom are girls. This represents a significant increase in the number of out-of-school children when compared to the 10.5 million estimated by UNICEF in 2021.\n\nIzedonmwen believes that Teesas can help bridge this educational gap in collaboration with the public, like-minded impact-driven organisations and other stakeholders such as the government.\n\n\u201cWe believe that our educational app is Africa\u2019s learning gateway because it opens up opportunities for learning by children anywhere.

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\nAyoola Oke, a former Special Assistant to the former Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) Dr. Ernest Ndukwe, has raised the alarm that over 90 per cent of home grown telecom operators may go into extinction within the next five years, if appropriate measures are not put in place.\n\nHe therefore called for strict regulatory policies that would protect smaller and home grown telecom operators from going into extinction.\n\nOke, an Information and Communications (ICT) Legal and Regulatory expert, spoke to newsmen in Lagos recently, about the issues affecting local telecom operators and raised the issue of how the bigger telecom operators are driving smaller operators out of business, insisting that should such development continued unabated, it might likely force smaller telecom operators out of business in the next five years.\n\nOke described the industry as sub-divided into three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. According to him, the Tier 1 operators are the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), such as MTN, Globacom, Airtel, 9mobile and ntel, while the Tier 3 operators are the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Spectranet PNLs, Swift Telephone Networks, Rainbownet and the International Data Access Service Providers.\n\nHe however said almost all the Tier 2 operators like Starcomms, Intercellular, Mobitel, MTS First Wireless, that were active and vibrant 14 years ago are now dead or struggling, leaving the Tier 2 space almost empty, noting that Tier 1 operators are currently faced with little or no competition, and as such, not ready to improve on their networks.\n\nHe said none of the local operators in Tier 2 space have been able to grow to become Tier 3 operators because they are dying gradually adding that the country would soon be left with only the Tier 1 operators who will operate a monopolist market, which he said, would be detrimental to the growth of the telecom sector, if the home grown operators eventually die out.\n\nThe Former Special Assistant cited the instance of bigger operators asking smaller operators to pay for termination rate in dollars rather than the country\u2019s legal tender which is the naira and consequently leading to their disconnection.\n\n\u201cIt is not a prophesy. If certain regulatory steps are not taken and things not done the way it should, more than 90 per cent of home grown local telecom operators will probably all die out in the next five years and that will be terrible for the country and consumers.From the way the industry is structured now, the bigger operators are suffocating the industry,\u201d Oke said.",

This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Netflix loses 970,000 subscribers in Q2",
          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Inside Kenya's messy money laundering grapple with fintechs",
          "text": "Inventing Anna and Ozark, two movies that have attracted global attention for their engaging crime-focused narratives, have lured Netflix subscribers into spending what amounts to be 208 centuries (20,800 years) during their runtime. A major similarity between both shows is the theme of money laundering. A phenomenon governments are grappling with globally. Kenya has featured some interesting news in recent weeks. Does it befit a movie? Well, why not read on.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, Kenyan publication, Star.co announced that a Kenyan high court had ordered the freezing of 56 accounts mainly belonging to Nigerian fintech juggernaut, Flutterwave. The decision to freeze these accounts, which had the sum of Ksh7 billion ($59 million) was made after the Asset Recovery Agency of Kenya, (ARA) told the court that the accounts were suspected money laundering conduits.\n\nHuge reactions followed this news, and while things didn\u2019t look good for Flutterwave given its recent run-ins with controversies, the skies were not clear for other Nigerian fintech companies.\n\nOn July 14th, 2021, a Kenyan high court again ordered that the accounts of two more Nigerian fintech startups, Korapay and Kandon technologies be frozen with the sum of ksh 45 million ($380,000).\n\nThe ARA alleged that both companies siphoned up to $6 billion with the suspicious movement of funds. It also stated that both companies were linked to Flutterwave and the related companies it accused of money laundering.\n\nBoth Flutterwave and Korapay have come out to deny these claims in their respective official statements. While Flutterwave stated that the allegations were false, it did not provide further information on the actual realities of the situation.\n\nKorapay, on the other hand, explained that the frozen funds in question were part of the requirements to obtain a payments processing license in Kenya.\n\nHowever, the issues run deep, and this is not the first time Nigerian companies have been flagged in Kenya. So far, the Kenyan government has frozen $*** billion in funds belonging to Nigerian firms.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a quick detour to understand the space.\n\nKenya\u2019s battle with money laundering\n\nMoney laundering regulations are very strict globally, and the laws constantly need to be updated. According to the UN, about 2- 5% of the world\u2019s GDP 800 billion to $2 trillion is generated from people trying to conceal the origin of illegally obtained funds using foreign banks or legitimate businesses as a front.\n\nA company or its founder could be directly involved in money laundering activities, or customers of financial institutions could take advantage of a loophole to facilitate their criminal process.\n\nAs you can already guess, that\u2019s why financial services companies are big on know-your-customer (KYC) requirements when opening an account. The potential for financial losses, organised crime, and terrorism, have made the financial sector one of the most heavily regulated in the world.\n\nWhile financial services institutions have strict regulations, money laundering still drains an average of $1.6 trillion annually from the global economy.\n\nTraditional finance companies have long struggled to keep up with the dynamism of fraudsters that keep finding creative ways to launder money, but research shows that fintechs have higher risks.\n\nThe rise of fintechs has reshaped the way we look at the financial services space globally. Per Sanction Scanner, the high growth and massive transaction volumes expose fintechs to several bad actors which might be difficult to control.\n\nHow? Criminals are constantly finding loopholes in an airtight system and when the company in question is a fintech, this can happen at high volumes. Against this backdrop, regulators either readjust or overhaul any existing frameworks.\n\nKenya\u2019s Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA) 2009 contains comprehensive guidelines for guarding against money laundering processes and other significant financial crimes.\n\nThis led to the formation of the ARA which is tasked with identifying, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscating crime proceeds in Kenya. An analogous body in Nigeria is the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).\n\nMost times, issues in the regulatory space do not get to the ARA. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) does the heavy work of keeping financial services companies in line with these regulations. On occasions when companies work on the fringes of these regulations and escape the direct lenses of the CBK, it\u2019s inevitable that the ARA would swoop in.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when a bank flags a suspicious transaction, it flags the account and invites the customer to clarify what the transaction was meant for. In more serious cases In Nigeria, the bank could report to the NFIU, or if it\u2019s high profile enough, the body could become actively involved in the process.\n\nInterestingly, the POCAMLA allows the ARA to freeze the account of any company where a suspicious transaction is flagged. The agency can freeze it for 45 days, and if it\u2019s not convinced, it can ask for an extra 90 days to finalise its investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if the ARA freezes accounts it will still have to determine if there was any wrongdoing from the affected parties.\n\nSo far, the agency has made some high-profile issued court orders to freeze accounts of suspected companies. However, recent reports suggest that Kenya is becoming a hotbed for money laundering, and Nigerian fintech companies are seemingly facing the heat of its renewed stringent measures.\n\nWhy is Kenya seemingly attacking Nigeria?\n\nIn many quarters, Nigeria\u2019s reputation as the origin of several Internet-based scams precedes it. The narrative is, however, not so straightforward as shown in this video below.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem that the ARA of Kenya seemingly has it out for Nigerian companies. A closer look at Flutterwave\u2019s and Korapay\u2019s statements, makes this seem like this is yet another case of regulations not catching up nicely with innovation.\n\nHowever, deeper research shows there\u2019s smoke emanating from the bunch of coals. Whether you interpret the series of information I\u2019m about to provide as suspicious or par from the course will depend on where you stand in the innovation vs regulation debate.\n\nNigeria has featured heavily in Kenya\u2019s recent crusade against money laundry. Before KiwiPay, Flutterwave, KoraPay, and Kando Technologies, Nigerian company Multigate Limited, and Avalon offshore logistics were also implicated in the ARA\u2019s investigation.\n\nMultigate Limited, founded by Nehikhare Eghosasere and Demuren Olufemi Olukunmi (who is an executive at Venture Garden Group, is reportedly the subject of an Interpol and ARA investigation.\n\nHowever, the current investigation on money laundering is not solely targeted at Nigerian companies. In June 2022, a Kenyan court, on the ARA\u2019s appeal, froze Sh2.3 billion ($19.48 million) in KiwiPay\u2019s account, a Singapore-based fintech startup. The appeal was based on money laundering suspicions, similar to those levelled against Flutterwave and Korapay.\n\nAbout four Kenyans were named as directors in these companies, and the KRA showed that this company could be involved in a larger and more complex money laundering scheme. South African company, OIT Africa was also among the companies with frozen accounts in Kenya.\n\nThe directors of RemX capital were also of Kenyan origin, and the entire series of allegations have featured Kenyans and Nigerians working in tandem.\n\nSo why has Nigeria stolen the limelight\n\nFlutterwave CEO, Gbenga Agboola, alluded to the imminent elections in Kenya as a possible reason for what seems to be a witchhunt of Nigerian companies.\n\nOther sources close to these fintech companies cautiously agree, stating that a sure-fire way to get people united during an election is to unite against a common, albeit, imaginary enemy.\n\nWhile the political undertones are not clear, reports that featured RemX Capital and Multigate Limited also claimed these companies were backed by a powerful Kenyan politician that remained unnamed for legal reasons.\n\nThe counterargument against this notion is that the investigations have seemingly started since 2020, and the ARA alleges that these companies are linked.\n\nHowever, if there\u2019s reason to believe that opposition parties are bringing funds into the country, the recent moves from the ARA would make sense.\n\nWhile there might be political undertones, we can take a progressive spin to this conversation.\n\nCross-border fintechs vs regulations\n\nSince all companies have denied these allegations, and investigations are still ongoing, it would be imprudent to jump to conclusions. If you\u2019ve been following the startup space, you\u2019d observe that companies use technologies to exploit loopholes in regulations.\n\nThe now-defunct motorcycle hailing companies of Lagos found theirs with the government\u2019s permitted bike capacity, solar companies are producing lower wattage mini-grids in high volumes to skirt around the regulatory limits, while digital banks acquire a state-level microfinance bank licence that allows them to operate nationwide with the aid of technology.\n\nAn investor with deep knowledge of Kenya\u2019s fintech space states the Kenyan government has actually been supportive of fintechs, so the recent moves have been quite surprising.\n\nIf the country of origin is irrelevant and not all fintechs are facing the ire of the ARA, it would be helpful to note what these fintechs have in common. All the fintechs in question are all operating some form of cross-border payment service. Either with cards or remittance.\n\nInterestingly, you\u2019d find that the cross-border payments space in Africa has been historically difficult, and legacy companies like Western Union and Moneygram have to constantly deal with tough regulations, making sub-Saharan Africa the most expensive region for you to send money to other countries.\n\nWhile most reports have focused on individuals sending money, what they haven\u2019t shown is how much more difficult it is for companies running global operations from these companies to manage payments and move funds across borders.\n\nEnter fintech companies looking to play in the cross-border payments space and make things significantly easier for Africans to send money to and from the continent. Flutterwave has established a presence in 33 African countries for B2B payments, Korapay, which recently expanded to the UK, Kandon Technologies, and Multigate Limited also help businesses manage funds across geographies, and different currencies.\n\nSo when you narrow things down, the ARA\u2019s suspicion is seemingly targeted at companies playing in the B2B cross-border payments service. For such companies, huge amounts of funds would have to be moved.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that large amounts of money are moved by our businesses does not make it money laundering and demonstrates a lack of understanding of our business model,\u201d says Multigate in a public statement to Nairametrics.\n\nConsidering Africa\u2019s tough regulatory environment, it\u2019s hardly surprising that they\u2019ve chosen to move money through weird routes that have raised the suspicion of the ARA regarding money laundering.\n\nLet\u2019s take Flutterwave, for example, which settles transactions for a global ride-hailing company, Uber, in Nigeria. The company collects payments from customers in naira but would sometimes need to settle a merchant like Uber in naira.\n\nIn Nigeria, the CBN has constantly implemented stringent measures to limit access to foreign exchanges, and that has become a huge issue. Consequently, the company would have to make use of partners in countries with similarly developed and FX friendly policies.\n\nA critical point the ARA made was that all the companies were linked in a complex money laundering scheme. While I could continue playing devil\u2019s advocate and put it down to fintechs collaborating, conversations I had yesterday and some further digging have raised my own suspicions.\n\nWhile the ARA linked Korapay to Flutterwave, I gathered from an off-the-books interview that both companies have not had a transaction in Kenya.\n\nYes, both companies had no official transactions, but business daily reports allege that Flutterwave made payments to Boxtrip capital, and other companies that seemingly have nothing to do with payment.\n\nWhile I\u2019m careful to not draw any conclusions from this, it shows that the ARA probably has good cause to be suspicious of such account activities. It\u2019s also another wake-up call for fintechs to rethink their approach to compliance and regulations.\n\n\u201cIf a licensed company in Nigeria sends a certain sum of money to a Kenyan account, the initial reactions shouldn\u2019t be money laundering. The ARA should, at least call the company to ask them what the transaction is for,\u201d a source argues.\n\nAccording to our source, the ARA\u2019s approach has created room for extortion of the respective sources, even though no clear case of money laundering has beyond money entering an account.\n\nIn Korapay\u2019s case, the company reported that the money in question was meant to acquire a payment licence to operate in Kenya. Apparently, the money has reportedly been sitting in the said account since 2021.\n\nThis example of regulators freezing accounts was seen last year with Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission and Chaka Technologies. It could be a sign for regulatory tightening, instead of the unpleasant narratives currently ongoing in several quarters.\n\nAlso, even if the companies are not engaged in anything on towards, we have to recognise that making cross-border transactions seamless for honest customers also could also mean seamless transactions for dishonest actors constantly looking to exploit financial loopholes.\n\nThe companies could also be in cahoots with these actors as we found with Ping express, a US cross-border payments startup whose founders were jailed for facilitating the proceeds of romance scams in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria reported the 2nd highest number of cyberattacks, and it has reported massive losses to fraud. On a global stage, it\u2019s a similar story, with $28 billion lost to card fraud alone.\n\nThe details of this story are far from over, and I\u2019ve refrained from disclosing some key information I can\u2019t yet confirm. Watch this space for constant updates. You can also catch up with us on Twitter by 7 pm today, to discuss compliance as a fintech founder.",

          "title": "Industry leaders identify path to Nigeria\u2019s economic revival at Zenith Bank International Trade Seminar",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nIt was another opportunity to proffer solutions to Nigeria\u2019s economic challenges when key industry players and other relevant stakeholders gathered in Lagos on Wednesday on the occasion of the seventh annual edition of Zenith Bank International Trade Seminar themed: \u2018Unlocking Opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s Non-Oil Export Business.\u2019\n\nTaking turns to dissect Key factors hampering the country\u2019s economic advancement during the event held at the Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos and virtually, the stakeholders were unanimous in their verdict that boosting non-oil export sector remained the catalyst for economic recovery.\n\nDelivering his goodwill messay, Mr. Jim Ovia, CON, founder and Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, called for a concerted effort towards diversifying Nigeria\u2019s export base through the promotion of non-oil exports.\n\nMr. Ovia who highlighted the importance of non-oil export to the nation\u2019s economy, pointed out that Nigeria exported cocoa and several other non-oil products for years before oil was discovered.\n\nHe cited the example of the 25-storey Cocoa House in Ibadan, which was built with proceeds from cocoa exports, while pointing out that many countries in the world, such as Japan and China been successful because they are doing a great deal of innovation, production and manufacturing of goods and services.\n\nAccording to him, industry players should also look at promoting the nation\u2019s non-oil export sector through technology to create technological giants like Apple, Tesla, and Google.\n\n\u201cAnd we already have technology companies in this mould in Nigeria, such as Flutterwave, which has a valuation of $3 billion, making it more valuable than some banks in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the enormous potential in Nigeria\u2019s non-oil sector, Ovia highlighted the phenomenal growth of Nigeria\u2019s emerging financial technology (Fintech) companies such as Flutherwave, OPay, Interswitch, Kuda and Paystack, with market valuations of $3 billion, $2 billion, $1 billion, $500 million, $200 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to him, this underscores the enormous opportunity in the Fintech space. He also noted that the most capitalized companies in the world, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Tesla, Visa, etc., are not oil companies but are in the technological innovation space.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Group Managing Director/CEO of Zenith Bank, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said that the annual Zenith Bank Trade Seminar has served as a veritable platform to deepen the conversation on promoting non-oil export in Nigeria, bringing together non-oil export practitioners and relevant government agencies to interact and explore the opportunities and proffer solutions to the challenges of non-oil export in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the origin of the Zenith Bank Annual International Trade Seminar, Onyeagwu said that the commodity price slump of 2014-2016 was a watershed moment.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhen crude oil prices plummeted from $114.55 per barrel in June 2014 to $28.76 in January 2016, with an attendant effect on the availability of foreign exchange, it was time to look towards the non-oil export sector for a more sustainable source of foreign exchange that is not susceptible to external shocks and price volatility.\n\nHighlighting some of the salient outcomes of the past six Zenith Bank Annual International Trade Seminar editions, Onyeagwu noted that previous editions\u2019 outcomes have found expression and influenced policy initiatives. For instance, the extension of the period of repatriation of Non-Oil Export proceeds from 90 days to 180 days and the policy mandating shippers not to carry export without a Nigeria Export Proceeds (NXP) Form Number were recommendations from previous seminars. Also, the need to incentivize exporters to repatriate their export proceeds through the official channels and the recommendation to create export terminals across various export hubs in the country were also from past seminars.\n\nAlso, previous editions recommended having Export Desks in commercial banks, which has now been instituted. He also stated that Zenith Bank has trained over 100 exporters through its Zero to Hero programmes which provide a platform for grooming and exposing beginners to become strong exporters by providing training on documentation, product sourcing, access to market and financing. He noted that Zenith Bank will continue the advocacy of promoting non-oil export.\n\nDelivering his goodwill message, the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, CON, commended Zenith Bank and its leadership led by the Founder and Chairman of the Board, Jim Ovia, for its laudable initiative in organizing an annual export seminar to explore opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s non-oil export with a view to increasing the nation\u2019s non-oil export base and ultimately increasing its share as a percentage of total export.\n\nIn his words: \u201cThis is why the theme of this year\u2019s seminar \u2018Unlocking Opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s Non-Oil Export Business\u2019 is timely and appropriate. This is because the global economy and structure are changing rapidly before our eyes.\n\n\u201cThe previous world economic order underpinned by globalization and seamless trade possibilities seems to be suffering major disruptions lately. We believe Nigeria has a lot of potentials, and we can harness this for the good of our people and country.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the CBN has undertaken several initiatives to promote the non-oil export sector because of its firm belief that the non-oil export sector holds enormous potential to contribute to employment generation, wealth creation and economic growth of the country.\n\nIn his keynote address, the President & Chief Executive of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, GCON, said that \u201cNigeria\u2019s non-oil export is quite low compared to other African top oil producers. This exposes the economy to oil price/production risks. There is much room for growth, and the CBN is helping drive this through the RT200 programme\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN RT200 FX programme, which aims to achieve $200 billion in foreign exchange earnings from non-oil proceeds over the next 3-5 years, has very laudable objectives, including enhancing foreign exchange inflow, diversifying the source of FX inflow, increasing the level of contribution from non-oil export, and ensuring stability and sustainability of FX flows.\n\nIn his Goodwill Message, His Excellency, Wamkele Mene, Secretary General, African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, enumerated the progress and achievements of the African Continental Free Trade Area and the efforts to improve intra-Africa trade. Also, in his Goodwill Message, Professor Benedict Oramah, President / Chairman of African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), highlighted the efforts of Afreximbank to enhance intra-Africa trade through the implementation of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS). According to him, the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System will make it easy and seamless for Africans to trade amongst themselves and receive payment for goods and services in their local currencies, eliminating currency conversion challenges.\n\nZenith Bank remains committed to promoting the non-oil export sector in Nigeria by identifying emerging opportunities which help stimulate non-oil exports and develop robust financial products and incentives for operators in the sector. The bank launched the Non-Oil Export Seminar in 2017 as an initiative to deepen the discourse on promoting the non-oil export business in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Dr. Godswill Ihetu, a former Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Nigeria LNG Limited, has noted that the commercialisation of NNPC won\u2019t resolve the problem of smuggling of petroleum products so long as subsidy remains.\n\nIhetu who spoke on Arise TV Morning Show on Wednesday, noted that the huge profit margin made by smugglers is a huge incentive driving the illicit business in the country.\n\nAccording to him, smuggling thrives because the price of premium motor spirit is significantly higher in countries surrounding Nigeria, and will persist as long as their is fuel subsidy in the country.\n\n\u201cThe point is petrol is significantly cheaper in Nigeria. We sell at N165 for example, let\u2019s say that the price is Benin Republic or even Cameroon is an equivalent of N300. What it means is that 33000 litre tanker taken across the border can give you over N4 million profit.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone who makes that kind margin from one transaction can afford to bribe anyone, and the person can do anything for such margin.\u201d\n\nIhetu, however, noted that the commercialisation of the NNPC represents significant progress, one that is irreversible.\n\n\u201cThe new NNPC Limited is a major step that is irreversible, because no government will ignore what is happening in other OPEC nations, such as Aramco in Saudi Arabia, PETRONAS of Malaysia, and Petrobras of Brazil,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFuture governments may tweak it but it is almost impossible to return to the old form. Everything may not be perfect now but with time. Those gray areas can addressed through amendments to improve on what we have now.\n\n\u201cThe industry has serious challenges, such as the non performing refineries, crude theft, subsidy etc, and we need fresh approach to deal with these problems. It is not possible to stop smuggling because of the huge incentive created by subsidy given the price differential between Nigeria and it\u2019s neighbours.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the new NNPC, he said, \u201cThe shareholders\u2019 structure has to be changed because states are likely to challenge the current structure, which does not involve them. As a commercial company, it can deal with the issue of refineries better without government interference, which may be the only way out of the present fuel crisis. The field has been opened for both NNPC and others to import and create competition in the market.\u201d",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has noted that inmates in Nigeria Correctional Centres might vote during the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, gave the hint on Tuesday when he received the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, and his team at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAt the parley, both organisations agreed that it was high time inmates were granted voting rights in compliance with an existing High Court judgement in Benin City, which ruled in favour of inmate voting.\n\nAs of 2020, there were about 73,726 inmates in Nigeria\u2019s correctional facilities across the country.\n\nThe INEC chairman noted that the commission was committed to inclusivity, including the rights of inmates to vote during elections.\n\nHe pointed out that inmates\u2019 voting rights have been recognised by Kenya and South Africa on the African continent, and Nigeria was ready to toe a similar path.\n\nYakubu, however, raised some germane issues which needed to be addressed in order to allow for successful inmates\u2019 voting, adding that \u201cthere was need to discuss the practicalities of how this could be achieved in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me start with the Legal Framework. Section 12, sub-section 1 of the Electoral Act 2022 lists five qualifications for registration as a voter in Nigeria, because you have to register as a voter before the right to exercise that right is conferred. That section of the Electoral Act has at least 5 qualifications.\n\n\u201cNumber one, the prospective registrant must be a Nigerian citizen. Number two, he or she must be 18 years of age, at least. Number three, he or she must originate, reside or work in the local government or be covered by the registration centre or the point of registration. Number four, that citizen of Nigeria must present himself or herself to the registration officer for registration and support. And number five, which is really critical to our discussion today, is that he or she must not be subject to any legal incapacity to vote under any law, rule, or regulation imposed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is one area that we need to discuss so that we know the categories of inmates that will exercise the right to vote and I\u2019m happy that you came with your Director, Legal. We, therefore, need to work things out carefully. We want transparency of the process. Because everything that we do in the Commission, particularly when it comes to the rights of citizens to vote, must be done transparently.\u201d\n\nOther issues raised by the INEC chairman included location of polling units for inmates, possibility of political party campaigns in the correctional facilities, voter education for inmates, voter registration for inmates, and observers\u2019 access to correctional facilities to monitor elections if polling units had to be situated in the facilities.\n\nHe stressed the need to address the issues militating against inmates\u2019 voting as soon as possible, as he pointed out that the 2023 general election was seven months away.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cThe sooner we\u2019re able to address these issues, the better for the process. But remember, we have only a little over seven months to the next general election. But the next general election is not going to be the last election conducted by Nigeria. So, even if we don\u2019t meet all these critical thresholds in 2023, we\u2019ll continue with a discussion to see what happens beyond 2023.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the CG of NCoS, represented by Deputy Comptroller-General in charge of Operations, Daniel Odaro, explained that the purpose of their visit was to discuss the issue of the inmates\u2019 voting rights.\n\nHe made reference to the ruling from the High Court which ruled in favour of inmates\u2019 voting and said they were in the commission to discuss the modalities to actualise the idea.",

          "text": "The move by Lagos State Government to generate a comprehensive database of all persons residing in the State has moved a notch higher, with the launch of an upgraded and chip-embedded smart residency card by the Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA), on Wednesday.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu personally unveiled the smart residency card at launching events held simultaneously across five locations in the State. The locations include Ikeja, Lagos Island, Badagry, Ikorodu and Epe.\n\nThe new card offered a transition from an ordinary plastic card, meant only for identification purposes, to a smart, multi-purpose ID that combines biometric identification with other benefits, such as security, financial services, transportation and access to government services and amenities.\n\nLagos started enrollment of its residents for residency registration in 2011 to create a reliable database to enable effective and realistic planning by the State Government, especially for the provision of social services and amenities.\n\nAlready, 6.5 million residents had been enrolled on the database by LASRRA, with the State witnessing four-fold increment in registration in the last three years.\n\nWith the launch of digitised card format, Sanwo-Olu said the State Government would be targeting to capture 10 million residents on the database before the end of the year.\n\nThis new residency ID, according to LASRRA, is a multipurpose smart card with 28 applets that make the provision of 28 services possible to the cardholders.\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cToday\u2019s relaunch is borne out of the need to embrace change and align with global best practices. We have upgraded the residency card from an ordinary plastic card, for identification purposes only, to a smart, multi-purpose card that combines biometric identification with other functionalities and benefits, that cuts across areas such as security, financial services, mobility and access to government services and amenities.\n\n\u201cLagos experiences significant levels of daily inbound migration of people seeking economic opportunities and a better life. As a result, our population is rising rapidly, with obvious implications for social services, social infrastructure, and for security. It has become imperative for the State Government to re-examine strategies aimed at improving the security of lives and properties of the people.\n\n\u201cThis smart residency card being launched today will help us to address the issues surrounding the identification and traceability of Lagos residents, and ultimately help inform the Government\u2019s planning and provision of services designed to secure lives and property. The card comes with an electronic wallet, which can hold funds and be used for daily transactions to support the cashless agenda of the monetary authorities.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said new visitors in Lagos who planned to live in the State for more than two consecutive months were now required to register for the residency card.\n\nThe Governor said Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) would be leveraging the database to validate residents for the purpose of delivering essential services, including health insurance, pension administration, school allocation based on residential addresses, and other necessary social amenities.\n\nSanwo-Olu solicited for the cooperation of all residents to register and acquire the card in order to enjoy the benefits on offer, and to enable the Government to plan effectively and allocate budget for the delivery of good governance against the backdrop of the State\u2019s growing population.\n\n\u201cThe political will and commitment of this administration to ensure that we are delivering on our mandate effectively and efficiently has led to heavy and ongoing investment in Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure on multiple fronts,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Governor on Innovation and Technology, Olatunbosun Alake, said the launch of the smart residency card became another foundational layer on which the Government\u2019s Smart City project would stand on, noting that the new card would also promote inclusion.\n\nExplaining the details of the re-launched card, Alake said the registration procedure now came with elastic and expandable biometric interfaces to allow updates of information. He added that the card utilises industry standard security chips that prevent duplicated identities and profiles.\n\n\u201cWe have a cloud redundancy system that allows 24 hours operations and a highly rated machine accuracy system. It has back-end cloud workload protection and two-factor authentication to make changes to information originally supplied, such as physical address,\u201d Alake explained.\n\nLASRRA General Manager, Engr. Ibilola Kasunmu, said the State could not afford to lag behind in the age of global digitalisation, thereby making the transition to smart residency card compelling.\n\nShe said the agency was motivated by the resolve to contribute to the overall vision of the current administration on finding innovative ways to improve on efficiency of governance and service delivery for the benefits of the people.\n\nKasunmu said: \u201cWe took account of certain limitations inherent in the initiative, developed an ecosystem framework with propositions to include a cost-effective approach to produce the smart ID cards for residents. We are glad to announce that we have been able to secure partnership of several private sector players on this laudable project as we needed to ensure the card remained free to the residents of the State. Residents are not expected to pay for the card.\u201d\n\nIn endorsing the new digitised ID format, Managing Director of Sterling Bank, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, said Lagos remained the cradle of transformation.\n\nThe high point was the symbolic presentation of the smart residency cards to the Governor and residents freshly registered by LASRRA.",

          "title": "Presidency: 2023 a must win election \u2013 Tinubu",
          "text": "Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said the forthcoming presidential election is a \u201cmust win\u201d for his party to bring jobs, education, food, medicine and hope among others.\n\nTinubu also defended his choice of former Borno state Governor Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, saying he remained unwavering in his belief that the lawmaker is \u201cthe very best person to run for office and to, hopefully, govern by my side.\u201d\n\nThe event had in attendance about 30 clerics, one of whom said the Body of Christ should be differentiated from political parties.\n\nSpeaking at the official unveiling of Kashim Shettima as his running mate Wednesday at the Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre Abuja, Tinubu said he believed Nigeria\u2019s diversity is her strength and \u201cwe must be victorious in order to achieve the greatness of which this country is capable.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery election brings with it the promise of renewed hope. This one shall be no different. For our party and for our nation, we hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before.\n\n\u201cWe must be wise of thought and courageous of action. We must win this election so that we can bring jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to the people of this country.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos state governor also said: \u201cMy decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cThis chapter in our nation\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach. In selecting Senator Shettima I have committed myself to this path. I have made the hard choice because I believe it is the best choice.\n\n\u201cThis is where politics must end and leadership must begin. True Leadership is not grounded in religion, populism or sentiment. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds.\n\n\u201cSenator Kashim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the Vice President. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.\u201d\n\n\u2026Ticket not sectional- Shettima\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Senator Shettima declared that his joint ticket with Tinubu \u201cisn\u2019t an imposition; it\u2019s an outcome of democracy at its practical best, and based on the aggregation of the ideas and insights.\n\n\u201cIf this were an unpopular option, as the cast of partisan provocateurs has attempted to paint, there wouldn\u2019t have been the tonnes of goodwill messages, especially from distinguished Christians, from all over the country. This ticket is a Nigerian project, not a sectional agenda that the frightened camps have been struggling to sensationalize.\u201d\n\nThe former Borno state governor further said: \u201cMy emergence as the running mate of the inimitable Jagaban Borgu, is based on the party\u2019s very forthright assessment of the threats ahead; and I\u2019m most honoured by the consensus of the distinguished stakeholders of our party, to trust me, with representing the nation\u2019s interests, under the leadership of the very sage, the youths all over our country, fondly refer to as \u201cCity Boy\u201d, in honour of his cosmopolitan profile.\n\n\u201cToday, I must also testify to the cyclical nature of history. But, like those before us, we must resist the temptation to throw a feast, over an invitation to serve the people. We must always take the past as our finest teacher, one never to be taken for granted. This would guide our staring into tomorrow. I\u2019m not unaware of the difficult political arithmetic that produced this moment, especially the understanding of our great Party\u2019s stakeholders and supporters, across religions, regions, and ethnicities. Their resolve to settle for this ticket is a testament to the faith they have in us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sincerely proud of the rational citizens, who view this, as nothing but a pragmatic permutation, to defeat our opponents at the polls, and based on acknowledgment and implementation of the candid perspectives of our Christian brothers and sisters in the APC, who, like us, are bound by the passion for us to retain power, in order to deepen the delivery of unifying and transformative governance, to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShettima promised \u201cto work with commitment for all Nigerians, especially the youths, give a firm assurance that no discrimination of any form will arise, from this patriotic alliance for the deepening of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cI want to assure our teeming supporters that, in the coming days, we will be rolling out our plans for a greater Nigeria, and pointing towards the bright future that we envisage; and away from the destination of those with nothing, but mudslinging to market, as the reason they deserve to be elected. Such hollow strategies shouldn\u2019t be the ideals of a nation, yearning for an experienced and documented visionary, like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, at the wheels.\u201d\n\n\u2026Adamu cautions\n\nWhile officially unveiling Shettima, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who recalled how the nation witnessed Muslim-Muslim ticket during the 1993 presidential election, said Nigeria needed men and women of character, competence and demonstrable evidence of their performance in public or private offices and not religious sentiment.\n\n\u201cSenator Shettima brings to the joint ticket impressive antecedents as a political leader and administrator. Senator Tinubu could not have made a better choice of a running mate. He chose a man he believes can partner with him to undertake the urgent task of our economic recovery as well as social and political development in peace and security,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nAdamu, however, warned the APC against disunity, saying the party leaders must purge themselves of the bitterness arising from our individual losses in the party primaries.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of the vice-presidential candidate today sends out a strong signal to the country that our great party is ready and united around the common cause of coasting home with victory at every level in 2023. But we must not be unmindful of the hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cIt is time to purge ourselves of the bitterness arising from our individual losses in the party primaries. It is time to submit ourselves to the Will of God and the party and do nothing to sabotage its well-laid plans for victory. The other political parties want what we want, and that is, to win and form the next government.\n\n\u201cIf by any acts of omission or commission we give in to bitterness and pettiness or fail to see the larger picture or take any of the political parties for granted, we would constitute an obstacle to the victory of our party. As the faithful would like to say, that will not be our portion. Our winning strategy must be anchored on a unity of purpose. I urge us to begin our march now towards the sunrise,\u201d the party\u2019s nation al chairman also said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi state, Atiku Bagudu, described Shettima as one of the Nigeria\u2019s finest, adding that the nation\u2019s \u2018s hope has resonated since Tinubu was announced as the APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cHe is undoubtedly the Nigeria\u2019s candidate,\u201d Bagudu said.\n\n\u2026Bishops, pastors attend\n\nMeanwhile, contrary to position of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) which rejected the ticket, a coalition of Bishops and some pastors showed up at the Musa Yar\u2019Adu Centre, venue of the unveiling of APC vice presidential candidate.\n\nThe Christian clerics, about 30 of them, were seen dressed in their cassock.\n\nThe Christian body Tuesday issued an official statement to reject any political party that settled for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nSpeaking newsmen, one of the clerics who identified himself as Bishop Oguba said he was not aware CAN had taken any position on the Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIf CAN has taken a decision, I am not aware of it and the body has not communicated to me in writing over the decision to oppose Muslim-Muslim joint presidential ticket. I am surprised you are asking me about the decision of CAN. My ministry is duly registered with Corporate Affairs Commission. I am not just running a ministry.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter about Muslim-Muslim ticket is an issue I have tried to call the attention of all clergies to differentiate whether we are politicians or servants of God. As far as I am concerned, the body of Christ is not a political party.\n\n\u201cSo, if APC decided to adopt Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have no business with that. What concerns me is the economy of the country and I will continue to advise all the clergies in this country not to use their selfish interest to bring down the economy of this country because the economy is greater than all religions in this country.\n\n\u201cThe clergies should be concerned about the security of the country not the same faith ticket by any political party. It is purely the decision of the political parties and CAN must take a stand, they would have gotten our addresses with CAC and send circulars to us over their decision.\u201d\n\n\u2026Anti-Muslim-Muslim protest thickens\n\nIn a related development, hundreds of protesters Wednesday stormed the national secretariat of the APC to register their grievance over the position of the party on the contentious Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe protest took place almost at the same time the leadership of the APC was unveiling Shettima at the Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre Abuja as Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe demonstration, which was led by few party members under the aegis of APC Hausa-Fulani Youth Forum, saw the delegation arrived the APC national secretariat in six luxury buses and few cars, raising different banners and chanting solidarity songs.\n\nSome of the banners read \u2018A cry for justice\u2019, \u2018Drop Shettima and give slot to our Christian brothers\u2019, \u2018Discrimination and mutual suspicion in our country\u2019 among others.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Convener of the Forum, Abdullahi Bilal Mohamadu, said they would not stop protesting until the party does the right.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the party\u2019s national chairman, Mohammadu stated that they saw Shetiima\u2019s selection as an aberration that should be corrected immediately by the leadership of the party.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe write to your good office in light of the prevailing circumstances arising from the decision of our Presidential candidate to select a Northern Muslim as his vice presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile it must be stated that there is a right to make decisions, however, such decisions must not be made to the collective detriment of the sensibilities of the people that make up the country of Nigeria especially at a time of mutual suspicion amongst the Christians and Muslims in the northern part of the country.\n\n\u201cAs concerned stakeholders of the APC and those who constitute the voting strength of our party, we find it worrisome that such a decision could be taken without recourse to its implication on the electoral chances of the party and the attendant uproar such a decision could bring about in the country.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this is insensitive and a gross display of a lack of respect for our Christian brothers and sisters especially the Middle Belt minority who have given all their best to us as one northern Nigeria. Picking another Muslim from the north eastern part of the country as his running mate is politically and morally indefensible.\n\n\u201cIn Northern Nigeria, there are credible candidates with rich credentials and with massive grassroots following that can complement the presidential ticket of the APC in the presidential elections. As such, the Hausa \u2013 Fulani Youths Forum sees the selection of Senator Kashim Shettima as an aberration that should be corrected with immediate effect by the relevant authorities within the party.\n\n\u201cThe implication of non-action in this regard can only be imagined, so much so that the majority of the eligible voters in Northern Nigeria have elected to boycott the APC in protest of the disrespect and disregard to our Northern Christian brothers, whose population and relevance in the scheme of things in the region cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cIf our party is desirous of recording electoral success in the 2023 presidential elections, it must retrace its steps by selecting a Christian from the Middle Belt as its vice presidential candidate. The party must not be perceived as promoting a religious agenda by fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cWe consequently say no to a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the APC. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari to kindly intervene to save the party from an electoral crisis. We urge Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to emulate the example of President Muhammadu Buhari in the choice of his running mate in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cOur Christian brothers and sisters deserve a place in the scheme of things, and our party must not be seen as a religiously insensitive party. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The federal government Wednesday said the planned street protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in solidarity with the striking members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is illegal.\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the decision of the NLC to join the strike would create anarchy\n\nHe said it\u2019s illegal for the union to embark on a protest because the congress has no dispute with the federal government.\n\nHe said as the umbrella body of workers\u2019 unions and associations, there was the need for the NLC to detach itself from politics.\n\n\u201cWe should also start to interrogate what labour is doing. The NLC is not a political party. The NLC can go on strike or protest if the rights of NLC members are involved. What the NLC is planning in the next two days is about interest.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no dispute whatsoever between NLC as a body with the federal government. Well yes, there\u2019s a dispute between some members of NLC, ASUU and the federal government which is being looked into.\n\n\u201cAnd NLC itself is a party to the committee that is looking into the solution. So, calling out people on street protest you begin to wonder, what is the motive of NLC in this matter?\n\n\u201cBut you see here, we do not interrogate what NLC is doing. NLC by its own laws, cannot even give out pamphlets. And NLC is supposed to be completely insulated from politics.\n\n\u201cNow, if you declare dispute with us, yes you can go on strike. Even that one would depend on whether certain steps have been taken or not. But this particular NLC, you know, asking and mobilising people to come out on strike on July 26 and 27, is clearly on nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nReminded that members of the NLC were worried about the prolonged strike which was also affecting their children, the minister said: \u201cThe federal government is as worried as NLC and everybody, but the law is the law. What we are saying is that rather than that, what I expect NLC to do as an umbrella body is to find solution, to join federal government in finding solution.\n\n\u201cThey are parts of the tripartite agreement that have been negotiating with federal government on this ASUU issue. So why are they now going out to take sides? I think you should also interrogate it yourselves.\n\n\u201cI think it is popular to get NLC out and support but ask yourself how does that help the problem? How does that solve the problem? What you are going to create is more anarchy. And I think the NLC should think twice about their proposed strike in solidarity with ASUU.\u201d\n\nSirika\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika said the threat by workers in the aviation industry to shut down airports in solidarity with ASUU would have grave implications on national security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m naturally concerned about this if the aviation union will shut down in support of ASUU. I would say they have no need to. I will say also that we should begin to look at civil aviation as a critical national security enterprise. It has all the implications.\n\n\u201cWe should not contemplate or think about an aviation disaster. We should also think about the general activity on the economy of Nigeria without civil aviation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This is democracy, you can push for demands, but in pressing for demands you should be reasonable in doing so. Where, the life that you\u2019re trying to promote, would be seriously affected and hampered, where lives can be lost because of your own activity, I think it should be reconsidered.\n\n\u201cSo, civil aviation workers, I think should not be part of this. Yes, I am concerned and yes we\u2019ve spoken to them and I don\u2019t think they will join because they know that there\u2019s huge responsibility of lives on their heads. If you\u2019re an air traffic controller, it involves national security. It involves the capability of preventing external aggression and so on so forth.\n\n\u201cI believe that they are very aware of the enormous responsibility upon them in civil aviation and they should continue to see it so and continue to be as law abiding as we want them to be,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige said President Muhammadu Buhari never ordered him to hands off negotiations with the striking varsity lecturers.\n\nBriefing State House correspondents, the minister said: \u201cThe truth of the matter is there is no such thing, it\u2019s just categorically untrue. There is nothing like hands off.\u201d\n\nAsked if the two-week directive by the president to resolve the issue is achievable, the minister said he had proposed one week to resolve the issue but the Minister of Education, Mr Adamu Adamu, volunteered to resolve the issues with ASUU in two weeks.\n\nThe minister said he hopes the issues would be resolved at the stipulated time.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026 Says Bayelsa Airport Is Not Downgraded\n\nBy Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Bayelsa State Government has made a clarification that the state-owned international airport had not been downgraded, as being insinuated in some quarters.\n\nHe said the absence of scheduled flights to and from the Bayelsa International Airport for a couple of weeks now was not the making or fault of the state government, but has to do with some technical issues with the two airline operators.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the clarification on Wednesday when the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Bayelsa State Council, paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Yenagoa.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo explained that two airlines, Ibom-Air and United Nigeria Airlines, were carrying out what he called D-Check on their aircraft, which had also affected their flight operations from their primary routes.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Governor, the D-Check is a major maintenance check to determine the air-worthiness of an aircraft after it had made commercial flights for a period of 10 years.\n\nHe pointed out that the state government was in touch with the management teams of both airlines, giving the assurance that normal flight operations would resume at the airport before the end of the month.\n\nHis words: \u201cI can assure you that the Governor Diri-led Administration is very much on course. I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check. The D-Check means a plane going for a major maintenance check after it had been put to flight operations for 10 years to determine its airworthiness.\n\n\u201cIf you watch very well, even flights in their regular or primary routes, like the Port Harcourt to Abuja route, have now been reduced to only one daily flight.\u201d\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, who noted that government was doing its best to change the general impression of leadership in the state, said the administration had taken proactive steps to checkmate the impact of the forecast impending large flood.\n\nHe called on the Federated Correspondents Chapel to help push out the good things government was doing in Bayelsa, noting that the Prosperity Administration was not resting on its oars in all sectors ranging from agriculture, sports, health to security.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, thanked the media for their support to the present administration right from its inception to date and assured the Chapel that government would support their annual lecture slated for November this year.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, however, observed that the standard of journalistic practice was in a steady decline in Nigeria, and therefore, called on the Correspondents Chapel and its parent body, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, to raise the bar.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state Chairman of the Federated Correspondents Chapel, NUJ, Mr. Tife Owolabi, said the visit was meant to formally introduce the newly elected executive members of the Chapel to the Deputy Governor.\n\nMr. Owolabi, who poured encomiums on the Deputy Governor for being media friendly, prayed the state\u2019s government to carry the correspondents chapel along in its programmes and events, even as he appealed for support towards their annual lecture programme.",

          "text": "By Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) has launched a novel Niger Delta Talent Hunt (NIDETH) to harness creativity among youths in the entertainment industry and address unemployment in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe Interim Administrator, NDDC, Dr. Efiong Akwa, who spoke on Wednesday during the inauguration of the programme at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt said it was designed to tackle the challenges and lack of opportunities facing youths in the region.\n\nDr. Akwa commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, for supporting activities aimed at harnessing the creative potential of youths in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entertainment industry is growing bigger everyday. The Nollywood industry occupies a major platform amongst other entertainment industries in the world. When you talk of entertainment the next thing you hear is Nollywood industry in Nigeria. Niger Delta is blessed.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to tell the world that youths of the Niger Delta are the best you can find around the world. They are calm, confident, they seek to excel in whatever endeavour they find themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the field of soccer the youths of Rivers State and Akwa-Ibom are taking the lead; wrestling, Delta and Edo are tops; swimming Bayelsa and Rivers are unbeatable.\n\n\u201cOur focus in this programme is to identify the talented youths, build them up and expose them to the world. We want to use this as an opportunity to provide a platform to expose the hidden talents in the region. If you build the youth, you build the nation.\u201d\n\nDr. Akwa\u2019s Special Adviser on Youths, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, described the Niger Delta youths as enterprising, observing that artistes from the region had challenges of getting support and platforms to express themselves.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe creative industry is one area that we can engage a lot of idle young people. We will continue to play our role in supporting institutions to create the platform to push our young people to the international community. We must keep the creative sector alive in the Niger Delta to develop young talents and to showcase them to the world.\n\n\u201cWe expect that after this process, we will be able to identify unique talents that would be able to showcased to the world. If you look at the entertainment industry you have employment opportunities that are waiting for us.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta youths need to be a part of these opportunities. We need to create engagements so that young people, who have a lot of energy can channel it towards talent development. The work of the NDDC is that of an interventionist agency. It is part of our job to create opportunities for young people to express themselves.\n\n\u201cThe sky is our starting point. We expect that after this talent hunt which is geared towards entertainment, we will be looking at sports\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the NDDC Director, Youths and Sports, Mr. Offiong Ephraim, said that NIDETH was a flagship programme of the NDDC Youths and Sports Directorate aimed at exposing the inherent talents in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe said the talent hunt programme would kick off from the first phase which is Ondo, Edo and Delta State and followed by the other phases with the grand finale taking place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State noting that it would cover the nine states of the Niger Delta Region.\n\nOne of the leading artistes in the region and consultant for the programme, Mr. Okiri Harrison, also known as Harry Song, said that the new NDDC youth programme was a dream come true for those in the creative sector.\n\nHe said that 80 per cent of the entertainment industry was rooted in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe musician said: \u201cIn the entertainment industry, cutting across music, comedy and theatre, the top talents are from the Niger Delta region. The main issue is that most talents remain unharnessed because there is no proper platform to identify and develop them. I am glad because this is where NIDETH comes in\u201d.",

Buildings have sprung up, filling stations and so on and so forth. So, which of course cause is at several point to redesign the project. Now, we are poised to complete it. And one of the key issues is that the project is based on pumping.\n\n\u201cAt the time it was awarded, diesel was very cheap. But now diesel is so expensive. So, we provided a solar component to provide energy for the pumps, to irrigate the land and this is one of the reasons in addition to variation of prices, foreign exchange fluctuation that calls for a review of this project, seeking for augmentation of about N6 billion and an extension of time to complete the project. At the same time, we felt the need for strengthening the technical, financial, managerial capacity of the company, which has dwindled over time.\n\n\u201cContractors of the company have been there on the site for like 24 years and they\u2019ve lost quite a lot of experts along the way. And therefore, we have now been able to reinforce the original contractor. Rather than terminate the contract, we feel it\u2019s better to just continue by reinforcing the efforts of the contractor through a joint venture with another company which is a Nigerian company, Messers Hydro Source and Resources Limited.\n\n\u201cSo is a joint venture between Messers Impressive Bakolori and Messers Hydro Source and Resources Limited and augmentation it for N6 billion to take the project to N11.026 billion with additional extension period of 24 months, plus 12 months effect liability period, making a total of 36 months.\u201d",

          "text": "By Naomi Douglas\n\n\u2026Call for solution to JetA1, forex scarcity to avoid shutdown\n\nAirline Operators of Nigeria AON, has lamented the closure of Runway by Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria FAAN, for 90 days.\n\nIn a statement signed on Wednesday by AON spokesperson, Professor Obiora Okonkwo said the action will further worsen the crisis facing Nigeria\u2019s aviation industry.\n\nOkonkwo urged federal government to quickly provide solutions to aviation fuel, foreign exchange scarcity to avoid total shutdown, collapse of the sector.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe reality of the situation in the industry is exacerbated by the action of the Federal Airports\n\nAuthority of Nigeria FAAN, which in a NOTAM of July 5, 2022 announced the closure of the\n\ndomestic runway 18L of Murtala Muhammed Airport MMA, Ikeja, beginning July 8, 2022.\n\nThe closure is for a period of 90 days.\n\n48, Awolowo Road, S.W. lkoyi, L.\n\n\u201cJetAl crisis which began in late February and deteriorated further through the months of March to May, has further worsened and is threatening the ability of airlines to continue operations.\n\n\u201cPrice had skyrocketed to over N800 per litre, adding that on top of the continuous rise in the price of Aviation fuel, supply was at best epileptic and unpredictable at several airports across the country, thereby causing flight delays, and even cancellations, as airlines queued for fuel at airports across the country\u201d.\n\nProfessor Okonkwo further noted that airlines carried out most of their activities in US dollars \u201cwhich today sells for N630 to $1; and is sadly also, in short supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a major influence on how quickly a grounded aircraft can be fixed and restored for flight operations, which impacts greatly on the reliability of schedules, growth of the industry and economic growth and sustainability.\n\n\u201cIn the face of the heavy burden already inflicted on airlines by the worsening Jet Al crisis, it is most unfortunate that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria FAAN chose this period to close the runway.\n\n\u201cThe ill-timed and unfortunate decision taken at very short notice to airlines has further crippled air transport operations by causing unsustainable additional operating costs and severely inconveniencing the airlines and passengers.\n\n\u201cThe closure of the main domestic runway of MMA automatically adds an additional 10-15% more fuel costs per sector into and out of the domestic airport in Lagos, based on the\n\nadditional flight and taxi time incurred as a result. The airlines have already felt these additional costs within the first week of the closure of the runway.\n\nThis unnecessary burden is\n\nunsustainable for a 3-month period on the airlines; especially for the fact that the Jet Al crisis has worsened significantly and the situation remains unpredictable.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the additional 30 minutes taxi time to the apron forced on the airlines by the closure of runway 18L impacts negatively on schedule reliability to sunset airports around the country leading to delays and cancellation of late flights to such airports.\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome the effort by FAAN to install runway lighting on Runway 18L after being delayed for so long, it is pertinent to state that international best practice for such critical\n\nairfield infrastructure projects is for the airport operator to enter into discussions with all affected parties, to arrive at an optimal arrangement that allows the work to be done, while limiting the inconvenience, economic impact and safety implications on all concerned.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, the Airline Operators of Nigeria AON wish to use the medium to graciously show appreciation to the Federal Government of Nigeria for its concern, and previous actions, which led to a mutually beneficial and cost-effective three-month aviation fuel supply window through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC. That intervention\n\ngreatly impacted on the aviation sector and solved what would have been a major national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cHowever, the issue is yet to be fully and generously resolved. We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to, once again, look critically at the issues raised in the statement as they affect scarcity and cost of aviation fuel and foreign exchange so as to find ways of ameliorating the problems that are likely to cause a shutdown of this very nationally essential service sector, which had contributed, and continues to contribute, to national economic development through jobs creation, taxes and increased commercial activities.\n\n\u201cAON also thanks the traveling public for empathizing with us in this critical time. Ours is an essential service that is patriotically, and selflessly, driven to serve Nigerians with our best and ensure that they continually, and safely, engage in business and leisure travels that help them achieve their objectives and also contribute positively to national economic development\u201d the statement reads.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has suspended Dana Airlines\u2019 Air Transport Licence (ATL) and Air Operator Certificate (AOC), indefinitely.\n\nNCAA Director-General, Captain Musa Nuhu, announced this in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe stated that the suspension of the operations of the airlines would take effect from midnight of July 20.\n\n\u201cThe suspension was made pursuant to Section 35(2), 3(b) and (4) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3(a)(1) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs), 2015,\u201d Nuhu said.\n\nAccording to him, the suspension order has since been communicated to the management of Dana Airlines.\n\nThe NCAA chief explained that the decision was the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the airline by the Authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the airline\u2019s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines was no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA acknowledges the negative effect this pre-emptive decision will have on the airline\u2019s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding, as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations,\u201d the statement added.\n\nDwindling Options For Passengers\n\nThe suspension of Dana Air operations adds to the woes and challenges bedevilling the aviation industry.\n\nOn Monday, Aero Contractors announced the temporary suspension of its \u201cscheduled passenger services operations\u201d.\n\nThe conditions of Aero\u2019s decision, however, had nothing to do with regulatory action by the NCAA.\n\nAero contractors explained in a statement that its decision was \u201cdue to the impact of the challenging operating environment\u201d on the airline\u2019s daily operations. The suspension took effect on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis does not in any way affect the Maintenance activities of the Approved Maintenance Organisation (AMO) otherwise known as AeroMRO, the Approved Training Organisation (ATO) also known as Aero Training School, the Helicopter and Charter Services operations,\u201d the airline said.\n\nThe airline acknowledged the inconvenience the move might cause.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused to our esteemed customers and promise to return to service as soon as possible,\u201d it said.\n\nAirlines in the country have battled challenges in recent times, mainly as a result of the upsurge in the price of aviation fuel and other issues. The challenges which had led airlines to threaten to shut down operations and interventions by the government have remained in place leading to the latest announcement by Aero.\n\nThe management reflected this in its statement, stressing that the suspension of passenger operations was a tough decision.\n\nIt said, \u201cThis decision was carefully considered and taken due to the fact that most of our aircraft are currently undergoing Maintenance, resulting in our inability to offer a seamless and efficient service to our esteemed customers.\n\n\u201cWe are working to bring these aircraft back to service in the next few weeks, so we can continue to offer our passengers the safe, efficient, and reliable services that Aero Contractors is known for, which is the hallmark of Aero Contractors Company of Nig.

Nigerians overwhelmingly voted for that ticket because they trusted Abiola \u2013 a man who opened his arms to every tribe and religion in this country,\u201d Adamu stated.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a man who has also thrown his arm around every tribe in Nigeria.

          "text": "The European Union told member states on Wednesday to cut gas usage by 15% until March as an emergency step after President Vladimir Putin warned that Russian supplies sent via the biggest pipeline to Europe could be reduced further and might even stop.\n\nDeliveries via Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which accounts for more than a third of Russian gas exports to the EU, are due to resume on Thursday after a 10-day halt for annual maintenance.\n\nBut supplies via that route had been reduced even before the maintenance outage in dispute over sanctioned parts, and may now be cut further, while flows via other routes, such as Ukraine, have also fallen since Russia invaded its neighbour in February.\n\nThe disruptions have hampered Europe\u2019s efforts to refill gas storage before winter, raising the risk of rationing and another hit to fragile economic growth if Moscow further restricts flows in retaliation for Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe European Commission proposed a voluntary target for all EU states to cut gas use by 15% from August to March, compared with their average consumption in the same period in 2016-2021.\n\n\u201cRussia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon. And therefore, in any event, whether it\u2019s a partial, major cut-off of Russian gas or a total cut-off of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready,\u201d EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.\n\nThe Commission proposal would enable Brussels to make the target mandatory in a supply emergency, if the EU declared a substantial risk of severe gas shortages. read more\n\nThe move, which needs the backing of EU states, will be discussed on Friday so ministers can approve it on July 26.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a full disruption is likely,\u201d one EU official said. \u201cIf we wait, it will be more expensive and it will mean us dancing to Russia\u2019s tune.\u201d\n\nEU states are trying to ensure storage facilities are 80% full by Nov. 1, from about 65% now. https://tmsnrt.rs/3RMqnZg\n\nWILL FLOWS RESUME?\n\nEuropean politicians say Russia is using technical issues as a pretext to cut deliveries. The Kremlin says Russia is a reliable energy supplier and blames sanctions for reduced flows.\n\nTwo Russian sources familiar with export plans said flows via Nord Stream 1 were expected to restart on Thursday but below capacity of 160 million cubic metres (mcm) per day.\n\nKremlin-controlled Gazprom (GAZP.MM) cut gas exports via the route to 40% capacity in June, blaming delays on the return of a turbine that Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) was servicing in Canada.\n\nThat turbine, which was caught up in sanctions, was reported this week to be on its way back, although Gazprom said on Wednesday it had not received documentation to reinstall it and said the turbine\u2019s return and maintenance of other equipment was needed to keep the pipeline running safely.\n\nPutin said there might be a further reduction in supplies or even a complete halt to flows via the pipeline that runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, which relies heavily on Russian fuel.\n\nHe said equipment was being returned from Canada but said the quality of the returned gear and other parameters meant the pipeline might still lead to a complete shut down in the future.\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 they will turn it off at some point, and that\u2019s it, and Nord Stream 1 will stop, because they came from there, from Canada,\u201d he said in televised comments.\n\nGas prices have rocketed in volatile trade since the Ukraine crisis erupted. The front-month gas contract climbed above 160 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) on Wednesday, 360% up on a year ago but below its March peak of 335 euros.\n\nThe surge in price has squeezed utility companies triggering bankruptcies. In Germany, the government plans to inject billions of euros into the country\u2019s biggest buyer of Russian gas, Uniper.\n\nSiemens Energy said maintaining turbines for the Nord Stream 1 would normally be a routine matter. It said it would continue maintaining equipment under sanctions if possible and where required, and it would work as fast as it could. read more\n\nIn earlier remarks, Putin said one of the five gas pumping units, operated by Siemens Energy at Nord Stream 1, was out of order due to a \u201ccrumbling of inside lining\u201d and another was due to be sent for maintenance on July 26.\n\nPutin said said Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, was not to blame for the reduction of gas transit capacity via a network of pipelines to Europe.\n\nHe blamed Kyiv for closing one route via Ukraine, although Ukraine\u2019s authorities blame the shutdown on Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nIn its pivot east, Gazprom said on Wednesday Russian gas supplies heading to China hit a new daily record. Moscow has been expanding capacity to supply China even as deliveries to Europe dwindle, although Russia\u2019s far east network is not connected to the European supply system.\n\nEuropean nations, meanwhile, have been chasing alternative supplies, although the global gas market was stretched even before the Ukraine crisis, with demand for the fuel recovering from the pandemic-induced downturn.\n\nThose efforts have included seeking more gas from suppliers linked to Europe by pipeline, such as Algeria, and by building or expanding more liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to receive shipments from much further afield, such as the United States.",

          "text": "Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, on Tuesday painted a rather confounding scenario, when he said the police are still hunting a notorious terrorist kingpin, Adamu Aliero, who was recently turbaned the Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by the now suspended Emir of Birnin Yandoto, in Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Aliyu Garba Marafa, by Governor Bello Matawalle.\n\nMasari, who spoke in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, however, expressed sadness over the development, saying his government has yet to forgive Aliero for killing his people, stressing that the state and police are still looking for the terror leader, who has been on police wanted list for the past two years.\n\nThe Katsina State Police Command had in June, 2020 declared Aliero wanted for masterminding the attack on Kadisau village of Faskari Local Government Area of the state, an incident that led to the killing of over 52 people.\n\nThe police further placed a bounty of N5,000,000 on his head to anyone with useful information that could lead to his arrest \u2013 either dead or alive.\n\nCuriously, however, the most sought after terrorists\u2019 kingpin was recently given a chieftaincy title of Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by Emir Marafa, which led to his immediate suspension by Governor Matawalle.\n\nBut Masari, during the interview, explained that the Katsina State government had not forgiven the notorious terrorist and that the government would work with security agencies to arrest the hoodlum.\n\nHe insisted that even if Aliero, has accepted to live peacefully with the farming communities in Zamfara, his government still considered him a terrorist and would do everything humanly possible to arrest him and make him face the law for the crimes he had committed.\n\nThe governor wondered why a criminal, who has been on wanted list of security operatives for years would be conferred with a chieftaincy title after killing innocent citizens in communities across Zamfara and Katsina States.\n\nHe reiterated that some terrorists recruited by Aliero were still killing, kidnapping and raping residents of Katsina State in villages and communities that bordered Zamfara .\n\n\u201cIt is surprising because Katsina and Zamfara are the same. If a neighbour doesn\u2019t support his neighbour, do you think he would be supported in his time of travail? So, it surprised me how they looked away from the travail of their neighbor (Katsina).\n\n\u201cIt affected them too because a traitor, when he is done with your enemy, would turn towards you. We\u2019ve not forgiven him and just as the police in Katsina said, they are still looking for him. For me, the one I have business with is the governor (Matawalle).\n\n\u201cI tried reaching out to him but he is not around and I did not get him. The police command here (Katsina) has the responsibility to reach out to the police in Zamfara to know what\u2019s actually going on.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is that the police in Katsina can\u2019t go to Zamfara and arrest him. So, if he dares enter Katsina again, we will arrest him so that he can answer for his crimes. Even if they said he has stopped, we know that here in Katsina, he is still killing people; his boys are still killing people,\u201d the governor maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists on Tuesday, launched fresh onslaught on Ruwan-Godiya community in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State and killed nine farmers, who were working on their farmlands.\n\nThe motorcycle-riding terrorists, who stormed the community in broad daylight, also injured no fewer than seven other farmers including their children.\n\nA resident of the community, Ibrahim Sani, told THISDAY in a telephone interview that, the criminals followed the victims to their respective farms and shot them dead.\n\n\u201cThey (terrorists) attacked us around 2pm this afternoon (Tuesday) and moved to nearby farms and starting killing people on their farms. We have so far recovered nine bodies. They injured seven people also.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of these people (terrorists), because they are killing and kidnapping our people on daily basis.

          "text": "The Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON) has condemned the decision of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to close the domestic runway, known as Runway 18L for three months.\n\nThe umbrella body of indigenous airlines in Nigeria said the closure added to additional operational cost, flight delays and disruptions, insisting that there are other alternatives instead of outright closure of the facility.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAON made its position known a letter it wrote to FAAN, dated July 15, 2022m, titled: \u2018Closure of Runway 18L at Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA),\u2019 and addressed to the Managing Director of the agency, Captain Rabiu Yadudu.\n\nAON said it received with surprise, the NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) of July 5, 2022, informing the industry that FAAN would be closing the domestic runway (18L) of MMA from July 8, 2022, for a period of 90 days.\n\nIt added that with such short notice, the association noted sadly that FAAN closed the runway, thus causing unsustainable additional operating costs and severely inconveniencing the airlines and passengers.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise the following critical issues for your urgent attention: The AON welcomes the effort by FAAN to install runway lighting on Runway 18L, at last. However, international best practice for such critical airfield infrastructure projects is for the airport operator to enter into discussions with all affected parties, to arrive at an optimal arrangement that allows the work to be done, while limiting the inconvenience, economic impact and safety implications on all concerned. In this instance, FAAN failed to do this.\u201d\n\nIt also noted that FAAN was aware of the current existential threat of aviation fuel prices to the domestic airlines, noting that the closure of the main domestic runway of MMA automatically adds an additional 10-15 per cent more fuel costs per sector into and out of MMA, based on the additional flight and taxi time incurred as a result.\n\nThe operators also disclosed that the airlines have already felt the additional costs within the first week of the closure of the runway, stressing that this unnecessary burden was unsustainable for a three-month period on the airlines.\n\n\u201cThe closure of Runway 18L has led to a chain of direct flight delays on a daily basis, impacting the entire system of scheduled domestic flights in the country. FAAN is aware that most domestic flights originate from or pass through MMA at some point every day. This is an unnecessary additional negative outcome for the industry.\n\n\u201cAON contends that in line with international best practice, runways of airports are only closed when there is no other option. For infrastructure projects such as this one on 18L, to limit the impact on flight operations, FAAN ought to have ensured that the contractor does the work at night, when the runway is not in use.\n\n\u201cIf there is an absolute need for work to be done during daylight hours, then agreement should have been reached with the runway users on what time window would allow this,\u201d AON said in the letter.\n\nIt also expressed disappointment that for the major airport in Nigeria, Runway 18L has been closed for a week now, with no evidence of any work going on; yet the airlines have been burdened with huge but unnecessary additional costs and flight delays, noting that, \u201csurely this situation is not in the best interests of the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, the additional taxi time due to closure of runway 18L impacts negatively on airlines schedule to sunset airports around the country leading to delays and cancellation of flights to these airports.\n\n\u201cGiven the above critical concerns, AON implores the management of FAAN to urgently review this closure of Runway 18L and enter into discussion with the users of the runway on a procedure for the project, that limits both the cost impact on airlines as well as disruption to normal flight operations,\u201d the operated stated.\n\nAON therefore called on FAAN to convene an urgent stakeholders\u2019 consultation meeting, to discuss the its decision and assured the agency of the operators\u2019 commitment to partnering with FAAN to install the long overdue runway lighting on Runway 18L, in line with accepted international best practice.\n\nChinedu Eze",

          "text": "Promoters of Ping Express have debunked allegations that the company or its past directors were involved in money laundering or fraud.\n\nThis follows the recent 27 months jail term slammed on the founders of the Texas-based fintech firm \u2013 Anslem Oshionebo and Opeyemi Odeyale \u2013 for allegedly failing to combat money laundering on the their platform during financial remittances to Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn a statement by Ping Express, which was released by Global Marketing Communications Professional, the agency managing the fintech\u2019s public relation, it stated that in the last two and a half years, the company had been dragged through the US court system on unsubstantiated allegations, including money laundering.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe deny any allegations that we participated in money laundering activities via our platform; and the court records are available and very clear.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply saddening that a technology that was designed to help immigrants stay connected to their families could have been grossly misused by a few of the platform\u2019s over 80 thousand customers.\n\n\u201cThe company did not steal from anyone and did not know or conspire with anyone to steal a dollar from anyone. The court documents and rulings are clear. No losses and no restitution were imposed on the company nor its founders and this validates that the US court recognised that no fraud was perpetrated within the company\u2019s platform nor was fraud aided or abetted by its founders,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAccording to the statement, Ping Express served more than 80,000 hardworking and honest Nigerians in the US and more in other parts of the world.\n\nPing Express operated in more than 28 countries including UK, Canada and several European countries and served immigrants from 27 African countries with consistent Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that were reviewed and approved by regulators.\n\n\u201cIt is of importance to note that some of the Ping\u2019s users that were queried by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) were customers of the top two competition.\n\n\u201cThese users paid Ping directly from their personal bank accounts in the US. All its customers were verified and went through extensive screening before their transactions were processed.\n\n\u201cInternal limits, which were subject to review per the Company\u2019s policy, are the basis for which we were non-compliant. In essence, customers have no hard limits per the Company\u2019s policies (not external limits).\n\n\u201cPing operated strict compliance standards, and ensured users paid from their personal bank accounts. Unfortunately, the US government insisted that Ping didn\u2019t consider and file enough suspicious reports on all its customers despite them paying from their personal bank accounts with monies already housed by American banks who in the dynamics that Ping know are the ones responsible for the flagging of the source of the monies in their customers\u2019 accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was apparently expected that its owners would know every single Nigerian by name, creed, behavior and track record, as amusing as this sounds, it\u2019s concerning and a pointer to many other things that has crystallized in this matter.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing to view the malicious and baseless claims being reported in the Nigerian media.\n\n\u201cThis becomes a sample case for us all to find company founders being held liable for internal control failures of their company, especially when they had no personal relationship with its users.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is what the Ping former owners are faced with,\u201d it added.\n\nOne of the founders, Oshionebo was quoted to have said: \u201cWe focused on making the simple task of helping a family much easier. We worked very hard with integrity to develop a system that disrupted the marketplace. \u201cRather than join other companies in creating customer service and relations team outside Nigeria, we were passionate about Nigeria and built one of the first outsourcing unit in Nigeria, employing over 40 Nigerians. History is the best judge.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Co-founder and former COO, Odeyale, said: \u201cHaving led an extremely expensive and painful legal battle with the US regulators over the last 3 years, with the full support of my wife, it was simply time to make decision that was only in the best interest of my family.\n\n\u201cI stand proud of what we have achieved for the Nigerian and African community in US and other part of the world.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji",

          "text": "An end may be in sight to the five-month old strike in Nigerian public universities as President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday directed the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to resolve the prolonged industrial action embarked upon by the four university-based unions and report back to him within two weeks.\n\nThis was just as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has urged the federal government to consider mobilising funds from different sources including non-budgetary outlets like stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes to help fund the needs of the education sector.\n\nOn their part, members of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian University, (SSANU) have warned the Professor Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it would not accept any disparity in university staff salary, saying it would take every legal action to ensure that such doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nBuhari gave the directive to end the 155-day old industrial action embarked on by ASUU as well as other university unions that later downed tools, after receiving briefings at the State House, Abuja, from relevant government Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs) involved in resolving the face-off with the university unions.\n\nASUU had proceeded on one month warning strike on February 14, 2022 and thereafter extended the industrial action, while other unions also withdrew their services after that as a result of the alleged inability of the federal government to meet up with their demands.\n\nThe three other unions that embarked on strike are the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) and the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT).\n\nHowever, the president was reported to have convened the meeting to receive briefing from the government team on while the strike had lingered for too long.\n\nBuhari after hearing from the relevant MDAs directly involved ordered the Minister of Education to ensure that the impasse was resolved within two weeks and report back to him.\n\nSources at the meeting said the president also directed that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, must attend all the meetings to be called to resolve the crisis.\n\nA sources added that the president, however, commended Ngige in his efforts so far to resolve the lingering crisis with the university unions.\n\nThose who attended the meeting with the president included the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu; his Finance, Budget and National Planning counterpart, Dr. Zainab Ahmed and Ngige.\n\nOthers included Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami; Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan; the Chairman of National Salaries Income and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta and the Director-General Budget Office, Ben Akabueze.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had on Monday expressed its resolve to hold a two-day national protest from July 26th and 27th, to demand the immediate reopening of the country\u2019s public-owned tertiary institutions.\n\nThe NLC had accused the federal government of not negotiating in good faith to resolve the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public Universities\n\nThe Labour movement had at its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Abuja, on June 30, 2022, threatened to embark on a nationwide protest to compel, \u201cthe federal government to conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\u201d\n\nThe federal government was then given a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the dispute or face a one-day nationwide labour protest which might culminate in a full blown worker\u2019s strike.\n\nThe federal government had said the proposal made by the Prof. Limi Briggs-led Committee in relation to the demands by members of ASUU and other unions in universities would gulp N1.12 trillion to implement.\n\nNgige, in a statement signed by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry, Olajide Oshundun, had said having rounded off its work, the Briggs Committee had proposed 109 -185 per cent increase in the university wage structure.\n\nHe had explained that based on the recommendation, federal government would incur, \u201can additional N560 billion as salaries alone, on top of the present N412 billion, less all other allowances such as earned academic allowances and fringe benefits, teaching allowance, field trip responsibility and post-graduate supervision allowances, and hazard allowances which were to gulp another N170 billion.\u201d\n\nASUU Suggests Use of Stamp Duty, GSM, Alcoholic Taxes to Fund Education\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has urged the federal government to utilise resources from the stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes to help fund the needs the education sector.\n\nThe union also took a swipe on Ngige, blaming him of constituting an obstacle to the process of resolution of the lingering dispute with the federal government.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday, ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke said the union was of the opinion that federal government could explore the possibility of sourcing funding for the development of the education sector from non-budgetary sources.\n\n\u201cASUU believes that the idea of availability of funds is a dynamic process. For instance, government can mobilise funds from different sources including non-budgetary outlets like the stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes.\n\n\u201cThese were parts of our recommendations at the National Workshop organised by the federal government on sustainable funding of education in Nigeria, held between 27th and 28th November, 2018, at the Banquet Hall of the State House in Abuja,\u201d it said.\n\nOsodeke said the workshop by the MDAs were also challenged to remit, for the purpose of raising budgetary profile, excesses that accrue and not accounted for.\n\n\u201cWe insist that until and unless these sources of \u2018loose funds\u2019 are pooled and appropriated in support of education funding, Nigerian Universities will not be positioned to compete globally as well as develop and attract local and foreign grants,\u201d he added.\n\nThe ASUU president said the union was also appalled by the recent calls by top government functionaries at both federal and state levels to establish more universities at a time agencies run by same Chief Executives had been tightly squeezed of funding.\n\nHe said ASUU was restating its opposition to the proliferation of universities and other tertiary institutions merely for political gains or electoral value.\n\nHe described the intentions of establishing new universities as hypocritical and the handwork of political jobbers who dangle the carrots of siting institutions they have no intention of developing to compete with others in Africa and beyond.\n\nOsodeke also spoke about the delay in reaching a resolution of the dispute with federal government, saying the government had been going back and forth on the issue.\n\nHe accused Ngige of deliberately misrepresenting the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO) convention on the collective bargaining agreement and the roles of a conciliator to serve his alleged propagandist interest in this matter.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, there have been insinuations by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that there was no agreement between ASUU and the government; that ASUU sat down to fix its own members\u2019 salaries; and that our Union asked representatives of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to recuse themselves from the negotiations, \u201d he said.\n\nOsodeke said ASUU participated at several meetings at the instance of the Ministry of Labour and Employment chaired by Ngige as, \u201cConciliator\u201d since it began its strike on February 14.\n\n\u201cTo our utter dismay, nothing concrete came out of the endless deliberations as the Conciliator kept approbating and reprobating. For instance, he would declare that he fully supported our demand that the renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU be speedily concluded within six weeks while at the same time creating an unrealistic pathway to arriving at a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Ngige kept going back and forth on concluding the integrity test for the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for replacing the discredited Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information (IPPIS) contrary to the letters and spirit of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of December 2021. \u201cMatters got to a head when our Union leaders were forced to express their frustration at one of the so-called conciliatory meetings. When we expressed our frustration at the manners the engagement processes were going, Ngige went on to lampoon the Ministry of Education; saying he was not our employer.\n\n\u201cAt a point, he directed our union to go and picket the office of the Minister of Education, who is our employer! Subsequently, he tactfully recused himself, \u201d he said.\n\nOsodeke also accused Ngige of frustrating move by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, and supported by the Co-chair of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) and President of Christian Association of Nigeria, Revd. Dr. Samson Ayokunle, to get the embargo placed on university workers\u2019 salaries lifted to pave way for amicable resolution of the crisis.\n\nThe ASUU president denied that the union said the president was going to sign agreement between it and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we said was that our draft agreement was receiving attention by the president. Our claim about a draft agreement was predicated on the fact that it was the second document to be produced by a joint Renegotiating Committee of the 2009 FGN/ASUU Agreement comprising representatives of MDAs and the ASUU team,\u201d he said.\n\nOsodake further questioned the rationale for granting the Minister of Labour the status of. Conciliator, adding that the Trade Dispute Act, the principal legislation for labour relations, does not empower the Minister to assume the office of conciliator.\n\nWe Won\u2019t Accept Any Disparity in Varsity Salary, Says SSANU\n\nOn its part, SSANU has warned the Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it woulf not accept any disparity in university staff salary and vowed to take every legal action to ensure that such doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt however commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his intervention in the ongoing strike embarked upon by the university based unions.\n\nUnlike its sister union, SSANU commended Ngige for what it described as his dexterity in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in the renegotiation exercise.\n\nNational President of SSANU, Mr. Mohammed Ibrahim stated these in a statement in Abuja, Tuesday.\n\nWhile commending Ngige for the role he has played in handling the negotiation of the 2009 Agreement, he said, \u201cSSANU is happy with the dexterity of the Minister of Labour and Employment in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in this renegotiation exercise.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the proposal for the review of salary for university staff with a differential of teaching staff taking between 108 to 180 per cent and unreasonable 10 per cent for non-teaching staff is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked to read that the Nimi Briggs Committee has submitted a report to the government while we only met with them twice. To say the least, SSANU is not happy with the pace of work in that committee.\n\n\u201cWhile we only met twice with them, we are aware that they have met with the teaching staff not less than 10 times. We are surprised how the so-called percentage was allocated to non-teaching staff. We have not had the opportunity of discussing salary review with them because the committee stated that they have not gotten the approval of their principal to discuss that.\n\n\u201cWe are seriously shocked and taken aback by the media report that a certain miserable, unacceptable percentage was recommended to non-teaching staff. We therefore advise that that committee should as a matter of urgency, conclude renegotiation with us.\u201d\n\nThe SSANU boss told the committee to immediately reconvene to conclude the assignment given to it by discussing frankly and truthfully the 2009 renegotiation document presented to it.\n\nWarning that non-teaching staff would not take it likely any attempt to have different payment table for staff, he said, \u201cThis is because the university system is a universal system comprising two broad categories of staff, the teaching, and the non-teaching staff and the salary consideration has always been the same except for allowances.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any attempt to give preferential treatment to any group will not only be unfair but unjust and inhumane.\n\n\u201cThe way the university operates, we are all in the system because of the students, the students are the most important stakeholder in the university project. Therefore, while the teaching staff is busy imparting knowledge to the students, the non-teaching staff have the responsibility of molding the character of students through the provision of a conducive and secure atmosphere and that is why at the end of any student graduating degrees are awarded to students if they are found worthy in character and learning. The teaching and nonteaching staff play complementary roles in making the university.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
