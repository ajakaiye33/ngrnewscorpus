          "title": "Traumatised after testing positive, mothers recount their stories of birthing HIV-negative babies",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nAs Nigeria joined the global community to mark the 2021 World AIDS Day, PUNCH HealthWise spoke with some mothers who got to know their HIV-positive status during antenatal care. They share their experiences on the trauma and fear they had to deal with during pregnancy and their excitement when they gave birth to HIV-negative babies after they were placed on treatment. ANGELA ONWUZOO reports:\n\nMary cried her heart out on December 31, 2018, when she tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). She was five months pregnant with her second child and her HIV-positive result devastated her. She was screened by the health workers during her antenatal care and when her test result came out positive for HIV, her mind was in turmoil.\n\nThe entrepreneur who left the hospital in tears was particularly troubled about how to break the news to her husband.\n\nThe 24-year-old mother of four who got married in 2016 could not figure out how she was infected with the deadly virus as she tested negative all through her antenatal care visits when she gave birth to her first child in a government-owned hospital in 2017.\n\nBased on the advice and encouragement of the doctor, Mary, however, summoned courage when she got home and told her husband in tears that she is HIV positive.\n\nThe mother of four was extremely afraid that her husband would send her away after hearing the news.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen as she was surprised that her husband received the news calmly and told her that contracting HIV was not the end of life.\n\nWhile she was consoled by her husband\u2019s response, she was hopeful that her confirmatory test would be negative. She was, however, also worried about her husband\u2019s status.\n\nThe fair complexion woman said she got the shock of her life and became traumatised when her confirmatory test returned positive and her husband tested negative for the virus after he ran his test.\n\nI became HIV positive after my first delivery \u2013mother of four\n\nSharing her experience with PUNCH HealthWise, Mary who has given birth to three HIV-negative babies since she contracted the infection says she never knew she could still have HIV-negative babies afterward.\n\n\u201cI found out I was HIV positive on December 31, 2018, during my antenatal care (ANC). I was five months pregnant with my second child when I registered for ANC and was asked to run an ANC profile. During the profile, the health workers checked my blood group, genotype, and HIV status. So, when the result of the HIV screening came out, it was positive. That was how I discovered that I am HIV positive.\n\n\u201cWhen the health workers broke the news to me and gave me my result, the next thing on my mind was suicide.\n\n\u201cI was crying bitterly that I was going to take my life. But one of the doctors that saw the way I was crying and shaking my head counselled me. He took time to talk to me and assured me that contracting HIV is not a death sentence provided I am on treatment and religiously take my drugs.\n\n\u201cHe assured me that if I take my medication as advised I will deliver an HIV-negative baby. He suggested I go for a confirmatory test, noting that if the result returns positive I will be placed in a facility where I can access Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission services,\u201d the entrepreneur narrated.\n\nMarry went on, \u201cThough I was somehow relieved after the counselling, my concern was how to break the news to my husband and what would become of my marriage.\n\n\u201cWhen he returned from his business that day, I started crying and he asked if somebody died. When he became so disturbed about what could make me cry uncontrollably, I summoned courage and broke the news to him. After which I told him I was going to kill myself because I couldn\u2019t explain how I was infected though deep in my heart I was suspecting I got it from him.\n\n\u201cBut I was surprised my husband received the news with calmness and told me that contracting HIV is not a death sentence. He asked me to go for a confirmatory test as the doctor suggested before I jump to a conclusion. His response gave me hope. But I was shocked to the marrow and devastated when my husband tested negative to the virus when he had his test done and my confirmatory test returned positive.\u201d\n\nContinuing, she said, \u201cI was however lucky to get my husband\u2019s support despite his status and I was placed in a PMTCT facility for treatment in order not to infect my baby.\n\n\u201cSo, at PMTCT clinic, I was given antiretroviral treatment and counselled how to be regular with my drugs in order not to infect my baby. The important thing according to physicians at the facility is to take my drugs properly as prescribed and I did.\n\n\u201cAnd to the glory of God, I gave birth to an HIV-negative baby in 2019. I am excited to say that I have given birth to three HIV-negative babies vaginally since I was infected. Necessary and confirmatory tests have been carried out on them and they all tested negative. The status of my children excites me despite living with the virus.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of breastfeeding, she said, \u201cI breastfed them for six months after which I introduced infant formula.\u201d\n\nANC helps to detect HIV-positive mothers\n\nA medical researcher, Dr. Dan Onwujekwe says HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding if she is not on treatment.\n\nOnwujekwe, a retired Chief Research Fellow at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba Lagos, told PUNCH HealthWise that it is also compulsory to test all pregnant women for HIV when they come to an antenatal clinic, stressing that it helps in the prevention of motor-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n\u201cIf we can provide antenatal care to every pregnant woman and during the antenatal care we offer them HIV testing, we would be able to detect those who are HIV positive and put them on treatment.\n\n\u201cAnd if they are treated three to six months before they deliver, it is likely they will not transmit HIV infection to their babies.\n\n\u201cBut we have so many babies being born with HIV in Nigeria because their mothers were not tested during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf pregnant women access antenatal care, those who are HIV positive would be discovered during screening and would be placed on treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, in Nigeria alone, about 22,000 new HIV infections occurred in children aged 0-14 years in 2019.\n\nHow I gave birth to four HIV negative babies \u201338-year-old HIV-positive mother\n\nAnother HIV-positive mother who succeeded in giving birth to four boys without infecting any of them after undergoing treatment is 38-year-old Precious.\n\nThe businesswoman narrated, \u201cI got married in 2009. So, in 2010 when I became pregnant, I went for my ANC when I was only two months pregnant. It was my first pregnancy.\n\n\u201cAfter my registration, I was asked by the doctor to run some tests including an HIV test. When the result of the HIV test came out, I tested positive for HIV. That was how I got to know that I am HIV positive. I was told to bring my husband to run the test which he did and his result was negative.\n\n\u201cThe doctor asked me to do a confirmatory test and the result was still positive. I couldn\u2019t figure out how I was infected\u201d\n\nAsked if she knew her HIV status before she got married, Precious said, \u201cTo be frank, I didn\u2019t know. And my husband and I did not do HIV screening before we got married because we dated for seven years before we tied the knot.\u201d\n\nOn how she successfully gave birth to four HIV-negative babies, she recounted, \u201cI was lucky I got my husband\u2019s support. Though it wasn\u2019t easy for me to move on when my husband tested negative because I thought I got it from him.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take my life because I couldn\u2019t figure out how I was infected. When my husband saw that I was serious about taking my life based on some moves I was making then, he stopped work for a while to monitor me. He didn\u2019t allow me to stay alone anymore. This went on for over a month because I thought I was going to have an HIV-positive baby which will be another burden to me.\n\n\u201cWhen I came out of the trauma, I went back to the doctor and he counselled me. He told me to immediately commence treatment. He assured me that if I could take my anti-retroviral drugs as instructed that I would live healthily and also have an HIV-negative baby.\n\n\u201cI heeded his advice and at the end gave birth to an HIV-negative baby in October 2010. I followed all the instructions given to me at the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) clinic and took my drugs as instructed. That was how I was able to give birth to four HIV-negative boys through a caesarean section.\n\n\u201cMy first child is now in secondary school. I am happy that the virus did not deny me the joy of motherhood.\u201d\n\nTesting HIV positive two weeks to my delivery traumatising\n\nFor Bisi, a 35-year-old mother, testing positive for HIV two weeks to her delivery during her second pregnancy, was a bitter pill to swallow.\n\n\u201cI had my first baby in 2016 after my wedding the previous year. I attended ANC and did all the necessary tests. I also did HIV test and everything was fine.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, when I became pregnant with the second baby, I registered for ANC when I was three months gone and was regular with my appointment. I did HIV screening during the registration and the result was negative.\n\n\u201cBut two weeks before my delivery, I was asked to do an HIV test and surprisingly, the result came out positive. My husband, however, tested negative. I suspected I contracted it in a salon. So, I was given treatment and the baby tested negative for HIV when I gave birth to him. I have been on treatment since then and in 2020, I was still able to give birth to another HIV-negative baby despite my status\u201d, the housewife narrated.\n\nOther HIV-positive nursing mothers who spoke with PUNCH HealthWise shared similar experiences of how they gave birth to HIV-negative babies despite their status.\n\nAccording to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, babies who are born to HIV-positive mothers are supposed to be tested for HIV several times in the first few months.\n\n\u201cThe test looks for the presence of the virus in the baby\u2019s blood. The baby has HIV infection if two of these test results are positive.\n\nThe baby does not have HIV infection if two of these test results are negative. Another type of HIV test is done when the baby is 12\u201318 months old,\u201d ACOG says.\n\nNewborn babies account for at least 22 per cent of new HIV infections in Nigeria \u2013NACA\n\nThe latest report by the National Agency for the Control of AIDS titled, \u2018Estimating modes of HIV transmission in Nigeria\u2019 launched in August 2021, shows that newborn babies account for at least 22 per cent of new HIV infections in Nigeria\n\nThe report reads in part, \u201cNew child infections due to mother-to-child transmission represent the second source of new infections accounting for 22 per cent of all new infections. In many states, the contribution is even larger.\u201d\n\nThe report added that the PMTCT programme, which could stop HIV-positive pregnant women from passing the virus to their offspring, had not been as effective as it should be because only 50 to 60 per cent of pregnant women get antenatal care.\n\n\u201cThe second-largest source of new HIV infections is newborns. Coverage of PMTCT is low due to low rates of antenatal attendance. Efforts are needed to encourage women to attend ANC especially in high prevalence states,\u201d the report noted.\n\nHIV pregnant women must be placed on treatment \u2013Experts\n\nContinuing, Onwujekwe blamed the burden of children living with HIV in Nigeria on poor HIV testing of pregnant women during ANC.\n\nThe researcher further explained, \u201cWe have a very high number of paediatric HIV, that is, children born with HIV. This shows that their mothers were not tested in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThat means they were not accessing antenatal care because if they were accessing antenatal care, the mothers would have been discovered and they would have been placed on treatment.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do since we still have a lot of paediatric HIV cases. The big challenge is to identify these babies who are likely to be born with HIV infection before they are born.\u201d\n\nThe health expert also decried the lack of personnel adequately trained to deliver HIV services.\n\nHe called for the training of traditional birth attendants in HIV management, adding that pregnant women patronising them should have access to HIV testing to further prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a mobile HIV monitoring and management team that can reach many TBAs and communities to deliver these services. They should be properly remunerated. If we can do that, no child will be born with HIV in Nigeria. And that is a window of opportunity we must try to invest in,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother medical expert, Dr. Olugbenga Ijaodola, says HIV-positive pregnant women must be placed on HIV treatment and encouraged to deliver in health facilities to reduce the burden of mother-to-child transmission of the infection.\n\nIjaodola who is an Assistant Director, National Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission at the Federal Ministry of Health said, \u201cThis will ensure that HIV positive babies are identified on time and treated\u201d.\n\nThe assistant director who leads the PMTCT team at the National AIDS and STIs Control Programme, said many babies are born HIV positive because their mothers had no access to care and were not on treatment before the babies were born.\n\n\u2018\u2018HIV/AIDS intervention cannot stand on its own, it needs the collaboration of every implementing partner. So irrespective of challenges in our health system, we say pregnant women must have access to testing and those who turn out positive must be placed on treatment and encouraged to deliver in health facilities for early infant diagnosis services,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, testing and counselling for HIV should be considered a routine component of the package of care for pregnant women in all antenatal care settings.\n\nTesting during ANC helps prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV \u2013WHO\n\nThe global health body stressed that testing during ANC helps in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nIt says the availability of HIV testing at ANC services is responsible for the high level of knowledge of HIV status among women in many countries. This, WHO said, has allowed women and infants to benefit from ART.\n\n\u201cWHO recommends that ART should be initiated in all pregnant women diagnosed with HIV.\n\n\u201cThis recommendation is based on evidence that shows that providing ART to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV improves individual health outcomes, prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and prevents horizontal transmission of HIV from the mother to an uninfected sexual partner,\u201d the global health body said.\n\nWorld AIDS Day, marked on December 1 every year since 1988 is an international day dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection. It is also to honour those who have fallen to the disease and people living with HIV.\n\nThe theme of World AIDS Day 2021 is \u2018End inequalities, End AIDS\u2019, which seeks to highlight the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services.\n\nIn commemoration of this year\u2019s World AIDS Day, the WHO, on December 1, called on global leaders and citizens to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and rally to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

The big challenge is to identify these babies who are likely to be born with HIV infection before they are born.\u201d\n\nThe health expert also decried the lack of personnel adequately trained to deliver HIV services.\n\nHe called for the training of traditional birth attendants in HIV management, adding that pregnant women patronising them should have access to HIV testing to further prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a mobile HIV monitoring and management team that can reach many TBAs and communities to deliver these services. They should be properly remunerated. If we can do that, no child will be born with HIV in Nigeria. And that is a window of opportunity we must try to invest in,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother medical expert, Dr. Olugbenga Ijaodola, says HIV-positive pregnant women must be placed on HIV treatment and encouraged to deliver in health facilities to reduce the burden of mother-to-child transmission of the infection.\n\nIjaodola who is an Assistant Director, National Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission at the Federal Ministry of Health said, \u201cThis will ensure that HIV positive babies are identified on time and treated\u201d.\n\nThe assistant director who leads the PMTCT team at the National AIDS and STIs Control Programme, said many babies are born HIV positive because their mothers had no access to care and were not on treatment before the babies were born.\n\n\u2018\u2018HIV/AIDS intervention cannot stand on its own, it needs the collaboration of every implementing partner. So irrespective of challenges in our health system, we say pregnant women must have access to testing and those who turn out positive must be placed on treatment and encouraged to deliver in health facilities for early infant diagnosis services,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, testing and counselling for HIV should be considered a routine component of the package of care for pregnant women in all antenatal care settings.\n\nTesting during ANC helps prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV \u2013WHO\n\nThe global health body stressed that testing during ANC helps in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nIt says the availability of HIV testing at ANC services is responsible for the high level of knowledge of HIV status among women in many countries. This, WHO said, has allowed women and infants to benefit from ART.\n\n\u201cWHO recommends that ART should be initiated in all pregnant women diagnosed with HIV.\n\n\u201cThis recommendation is based on evidence that shows that providing ART to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV improves individual health outcomes, prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and prevents horizontal transmission of HIV from the mother to an uninfected sexual partner,\u201d the global health body said.\n\nWorld AIDS Day, marked on December 1 every year since 1988 is an international day dedicated to raising awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection. It is also to honour those who have fallen to the disease and people living with HIV.\n\nThe theme of World AIDS Day 2021 is \u2018End inequalities, End AIDS\u2019, which seeks to highlight the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services.\n\nIn commemoration of this year\u2019s World AIDS Day, the WHO, on December 1, called on global leaders and citizens to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and rally to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Toluwalope Kareem\n\nA consultant dermatologist at Federal Medical Centre, Abuja, Dr. Haroun Adamu, discusses acne, in this interview with TOLUWALOPE KAREEM\n\nWhat is acne?\n\nAcne is a very common skin condition that occurs as a result of pores on the skin getting blocked by dead skin, oil, and bacteria. This results in all types of pimples, whether white heads or blackheads. It is quite common. About 80 per cent of people between the ages of 11 and 30 years would develop acne at some point in their lives.\n\nWhat are the causes of acne?\n\nThe underlying cause of acne is the blockage of pores or holes on the surface of the skin by accumulated oil, bacteria and dead skin. People believe that things like chips, milk, chocolates contribute to acne, but there is no scientific proof for that. However, certain changes may occur in one\u2019s life that can contribute to having breakouts of acne or pimples and this includes hormonal changes that take place as a child goes into puberty. Also, use of hormonal medications like contraceptives, eating sugary foods. Generally, all these can trigger acne. Pregnancy, which is associated with hormonal changes, can help trigger acne.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\n\nAcne is usually diagnosed by what we doctors call clinical assessment. The doctor examines the skin and looks for signs of pimples, like the blackhead, nodules etc, or even scars related to acne. A test is hardly necessary to diagnose acne.\n\nHow best is acne treated?\n\nThere are many methods of treating acne. Most times we use a combination of two or three methods. We make use of topical creams, topical or oral antibiotics, or hormonal tablets. Sometimes we combine these treatments with chemical peels or we use light therapy. Acne is treated on an individual basis, based on severity. Some are mild, some are associated with pigmentation, some are associated with scars and some develop keloids as a complication.\n\nAll forms of acne are treatable, although certain forms of acne can be challenging such as hormonal acne, nodular acne, pustular acne, and certain forms of treatment might not be successful, but when you take all the available forms of treatment, whether creams, tablets, antibiotics, hormonals, chemicals, you can hardly find a type of acne that is not treatable. There can be challenges with the treatment of some types of acne, especially if for one reason or the other you are not able to use one or more of the forms of treatment that we have. In that case, it can be a challenge. For instance, if you react to a certain tablet because of some medical condition you are not able to take a tablet or use certain creams because you have sensitive skin. With the service of a professional and trained dermatologist, you\u2019ll be able to overcome the condition.\n\nHow long does it take to get it treated?\n\nThe time it takes to treat acne varies; you need to give it time to work, four weeks at least. It can be shorter, but the usual period is four to six weeks to see improvement. It can also take up to three months; it is highly variable depending on the severity and nature of acne.\n\nIf acne is not treated, can it go away on its own?\n\nYes, a lot of acne does go away on its own especially when the person passes puberty, it heals and goes away on its own, but remember a lot of people also carry their acne into adulthood. There is acne that starts from adulthood, i.e. the people that didn\u2019t have acne as adolescents but develop it now during adulthood.\n\nWhat are the factors that make acne worse and people do not know off?\n\nThere are factors that can make acne worse which people are not aware of. Such factors include frequent changes in creams or medications especially in the context of self-mediation. Doing this puts the skin under pressure. Another thing is improper removal of makeup or the use of hair cream or ointment used can roll down to your forehead and face and cause acne. Other factors that can trigger acne are hair removal; foods that are high in carbohydrates and sugary food. Other factors are heavy makeup, excessive use of skincare products and anti-acne treatment.\n\nIs it true that factors such as stress, makeup, greasy foods, dirty skin can cause acne?\n\nThe truth is stress, makeup, greasy food, dirty skin can trigger and worsen acne. Stress worsens acne by increasing your stress hormone level and can block the pores. Heavy makeup would not allow the skin to breathe, and that can worsen acne. For greasy food and dirty skin, of course, when you don\u2019t wash your skin, the dirt and bacteria would accumulate and this can block your pores spaces and worsen acne. They are not really myths; they can contribute to and worsen your acne.\n\nPeople have said using urine to wash their faces cures acne, how true is this?\n\nScientifically, I am not aware that washing your face with urine can cure acne; people who do that should best avoid such practices, and some dermatologists are trained in the care and treatment of acne. If you have acne, you should see a qualified and trained dermatologist to manage your acne. There is absolutely no proof of that and I don\u2019t think it is healthy, so people should deviate from such practices. Urine is a waste material from the body and should not be used as a treatment for acne or any other medical condition.\n\nHow true it is that aloe vera, apple ciders are effective in treating acne?\n\nWell, aloe vera has a potential role to play in clearing the skin and preventing acne; it calms and hydrates the face. But standing alone on its own is not certain it can cure acne. There is no scientific evidence that apple cider vinegar can treat acne. It contains acids like lactic acid, acetic acid etc. That may theoretically make it useful for killing propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria involved in the causation of ace. But practically, using ACV to treat acne, especially at home, only predisposes the user to irritation and burns when used in high concentrations.\n\nHow effective is self-care effective in the treatment of acne?\n\nSelf-care for mild acne can work if the carrier is adequately informed about the dos and don\u2019ts and if the products used over the counter are ethical and scientifically proven for effectiveness. The best results are, of course, always obtained by consulting a dermatologist.\n\nA lot of people go through emotional and mental stress because of acne; what do you advise?\n\nIt is true that severe acne, even mild acne, has a lot of effects and can impact the quality of life and the way the person perceives him or herself. It can lead to anxiety and depression, but it shouldn\u2019t be so. Acne in most cases is treatable; people who suffer from acne must seek treatment from qualified professionals to alleviate the mental stress and restore their self-confidence.\n\nAcne makes some people lose self-esteem or feel stigmatised; what is your advice for them?\n\nAcne sufferers should not feel stigmatised, they should channel their energy and resources into getting the best available treatment and care for their skin. There is no need for the feeling of stigmatisation. Consult with a dermatologist, be patient with your treatment and that acne can be overcome. More challenging, of course, is the acne scars that follow after treatment, but acne itself should not cause stigmatisation. Yes, it is true that sufferers feel low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, loss of confidence and this has been proven in several studies, both within and outside Nigeria. Our society places great emphasis on looks and acne on the face is difficult to hide. You find acne sufferers avoiding reunions, avoiding group photographs or \u201cselfies\u201d. This shouldn\u2019t be. Find a dermatologist who understands your emotional anguish and addresses them with empathy as your acne gets treated.\n\nWhat are some of the basic tips to prevent acne?\n\nThere are certain basic tips that can help prevent acne, such as cleanliness and regular exercise. If you have discovered any food that tends to worsen your acne, you should avoid them. Repeated touching of your face and popping of pimples is not good, it makes it worse. Do not go to bed with your makeup on. Avoid excessive use of acne medication, jumping from one set of medication to another without medical supervision. Avoid using unknown or unproven mixed creams. Seek professional help when you have acne.\n\nCan acne be genetic?\n\nCertain inherited factors can make one susceptible to the development of acne. An example is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which leads to hormonal imbalance. This can run in families and when you inherit this syndrome you also have a high tendency to develop acne that is associated with PCOS. The PCOS is a metabolic hormonal imbalance that\u2019s complex but one of its manifestation is the development and disposition to acne. One can also inherit an immune system that is unable to handle the bacterium implicated in the constitution of acne. If you inherit an immune system that is unable to handle it, then you may be predisposed to acne. Again, there are chances that if you have one or both of your parents having or have had acne, there is a tendency you will have acne, too. But in terms of a direct genetic transfer or a direct gene that will predispose you to acne, there is no such gene. Your having acne is an interplay of multiple factors.\n\nDoes acne have any relationship with age?\n\nYes, there is a relationship between acne and age. Girls start to have acne between the ages of 14-17, and boys have theirs between the ages of 16-19. Of course, people have acne for a number of years before it begins to clear. Mostly acne begins to disappear when a person is in their mid-20s, in some cases acne can proceed to adulthood. There are cases of acne that commences at adulthood in the 30s and sometimes 40s.\n\nWhat happens if acne is not treated?\n\nIt may go away, it may worsen and it may lead to scarring, pigmentation, or keloids, it depends.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Shutdowns exert significant chilling effects, with direct implications on participatory democracy, whose existence depends upon an active and informed citizenry capable of engaging with a range of ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has constitutional and international legal obligations to enable access to the Internet for all, as access to the Internet is inextricably linked to the exercise of freedom of expression and information.\u201d\n\nThe suit read in part: \u201cInternet and telecommunication shutdowns amount to inherently disproportionate interference with the rights to freedom of expression and information. Necessity requires a showing that shutdowns would achieve their stated purpose, which in fact they often jeopardize.\n\n\u201cIn their 2011 Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet, four special mandates on freedom of expression emphasised that \u2018Cutting off access to the Internet, or parts of the Internet, for whole populations or segments of the public can never be justified, including on public order or national security grounds.\n\n\u201cThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights has affirmed the principle of non-interference with access to internet and telecommunication networks and stressed that states including Nigeria \u2018shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\n\n\u201cIn June 2016, the UN Human Rights Council, condemned \u2018measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law.\u2019 The Council called on all States, including Nigeria, to refrain from and cease such measures.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression and access to information are protected by Section 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights both of which Nigeria has ratified.\n\n\u201cThese rights must be protected online as they are protected offline. Access to the Internet is a fundamental right. Access to the internet is also a necessary precondition for the exercise and enjoyment of other human rights online and offline.\n\n\u201cShutdowns generate a wide variety of harms to human rights, economic activity, public safety and emergency services that outweigh the purported benefits. Any shutdown has the potential to affect millions of internet and telecommunication users, and those on the margins of society are most impacted by it.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of the internet and telecommunication networks in Zamfara and Katsina states, without any legal justification, is inconsistent with the principles of necessity and proportionality. The suspension is a form of collective punishment of Nigerians resident in these states.\n\n\u201cThe imposition of any restrictions should be guided by the objective of facilitating the right, rather than seeking unnecessary and disproportionate limitations on it.\n\n\u201cRestrictions must not be discriminatory, impair the essence of the right, or be aimed at causing a chilling effect. Internet and telecommunication shutdowns fail to meet all of these conditions.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Family hosts posthumous birthday for deceased\n\n\u2022Principal of Dowen College should be arrested\u2019\n\nBy Samuel Oyadongha, Esther Onyegbula & Cynthia Damian\n\nThe outrage over the death of a student of Dowen College, Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni, increased, yesterday, as Delta State government, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, demanded a proper investigation of the matter.\n\nThey were unanimous in calling for whoever is responsible to be identified and punished.\n\nThe management of Dowen College had, last Wednesday, claimed the 12-year-old student died from hip injuries he sustained after playing football\n\nBut reports had emerged that he was bullied and beaten by fellow students, leading to nationwide condemnation.\n\nContrary to the school\u2019s statement, the deceased\u2019s cousin shared pictures and video evidence, which confirmed suspicions that the child was bullied.\n\nLagos State government had shut down the school while an investigation was ordered into the matter.\n\nHowever, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa hailed the move yesterday, saying it would support Governor Sanwo-Olu\u2019s decision to launch an investigation into the boy\u2019s death.\n\nFather\n\nOkowa, who spoke with the father of the deceased, said he is determined to pursue the case to the end.\n\nHis words: \u201cLast night, I spoke to Mr. Sylvester Oromoni, the father of late Sylvester Oromoni Jnr., the Dowen College student who unfortunately died under very controversial and unclear circumstances.\n\n\u201cDuring the call, I expressed my agreement with the decision of the Lagos State Government to launch an investigation into the death of Sylvester, a native of Warri South LGA in Delta State.\n\n\u201cAs a government that places priority on the lives of our citizens within and outside the state, we are determined to pursue this case to the end.\n\n\u201cThe matter must be investigated, perpetrators apprehended, punished, and made an example to serve as a very strong deterrent against future occurrences.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, IYC expressed surprise that the school said Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten, saying the institution must be investigated.\n\nThe Ijaw group said this in a statement by its National Spokesman, Ebilade Ekerefe.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cwe have read to our chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\nBullied\n\n\u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations, stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the school\u2019s statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u201cThe late Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbe-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil. We are thankful to them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the school management, who instead of speaking the truth soiled their souls by trying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down Dowen College, the Ijaw youths worldwide call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe also call for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the alleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death. They have shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder. The fake story about the hip injury from a game of football shows in clear language that they are complicit in the crime.\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story, if true, amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State government and the Ministry of Education that the operating license of the school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions that place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, we commend all concerned Nigerians. We commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development. We commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity shown by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, commiserate with Sylvester Oromini Snr and the entire Ogbeh-Ijoh royal family on this royal blood that has been spilt in a most dastardly manner.\u201d\n\nNBA\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman of Warri South Local Government Area, Delta State, Mr. Michael Tidi, called on the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, to get involved in unravelling the circumstances behind the death.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs a father and friend to Mr. Sly Oromoni, if I don\u2019t add my voice in condemnation of the circumstances that led to the death of his beloved son, Sly Jnr, who would have clocked 13 years today, then one could pass for being inhumane.\n\n\u201cI commend the Lagos State government for closing down the college. But it shouldn\u2019t end there. A full-scale investigation must be carried out. The NBA which I aspire to be part of in no distant time is enjoined to step in to ensure this issue is not swept under the carpet like others.\n\n\u201cFrom the conversation I had with Mr. Sylvester, the lesson for me is this: Parents, especially those whose wards are in these so-called high profile schools must carry out routine interrogations of the happenings in the schools as negligence on the part of school authorities is becoming a recurring decimal. More attention needs to equally be paid to our kids regardless of how busy we parents could be.\n\nHumanity\n\n\u201cThe death of Sly Jnr. has depleted the ranks of intelligent lads in Warri and Nigeria generally. Justice is what we seek even as we count on God Almighty to recompense whoever was responsible for snuffing life out of this lad.\n\nThat the people of Warri and sizable Nigerians are united in grief to mourn him is a measure of our humanity. May the perpetual light of God continue to shine on Sly Jnr who transited to the great beyond. My deepest condolences to the Oromonis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the family of the deceased marked his 13th year birthday, saying \u201che always wanted to fly planes.\u201d\n\nPictures of the event, showing his family and friends cutting a birthday cake were shared online yesterday.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Wanted in Nigeria: Viable political parties",
          "text": "By Tonnie Iredia\n\nOn December 12, 1987, local government elections were held throughout Nigeria and because the country was at the time, under military rule, the elections were conducted on non-party basis in the absence of political parties.\n\nVoters were therefore enjoined to use their knowledge of the traits, charisma and integrity of individual candidates to make their choices. The elections were peaceful but the characteristic flamboyance and joyous environment which political parties create around elections were absent.\n\nThe military government of the time led by General Ibrahim Babangida was merely testing the waters before instituting a full-scale transition to civil rule political programme. By the time political parties came on board, the 1987 situation had been completely reversed.\n\nTo start with, efforts to register genuine political parties were thwarted by the politicians who evolved a plethora of malpractices. This prompted the creation of two government approved parties. Although the political class greatly criticized Babangida, it is now clear that his understanding of our politicians was near perfect. Nigerian politicians have never been interested in the formation and management of parties, all they always wanted was to be in government \u2013 a posture that is yet to change till today.\n\nThere were other subsisting defects in the structure and disposition of our political class. First, the parties did not and still do not attract persons of like minds into their fold as is typical of political formations. Most of our politicians have no time for principles, instead they have remained opportunists.\n\nOpposition parties do not exist in the strict sense to offer alternative view-points that can keep the ruling party in check. The result has been daily decamping of mostly opposition politicians to the government party. Everyone wants to hold a government position which is generally seen as lucrative.\n\nEven legislators prefer the execution of projects to law-making. In other parts of the world, legislators are rated by the quality of their contributions to debates on the floor of the legislature. In the circumstance, no one wants to manage the party, it is government positions that everyone aspires to occupy.\n\nIn other words, whereas political parties form and run government in other parts of the globe, it is government that runs political parties in Nigeria, hence, the holder of the highest political office in a state (governor) automatically becomes the leader of the party in such a state thereby displacing the original party strategist who worked for the party\u2019s electoral victory.\n\nToday, the two major identical political parties are on the same page on the subject. In fact, it was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that introduced the strategy of subordinating party executives to government positions. The current ruling political party at the federal level, the All Progressive Congress (APC) has revised it by running the party with a caretaker committee that is led by a serving governor \u2013 a party member who had managed to win a governorship election. Caretaker committee management of a political party is an aberration because a party has no business dissolving an entire executive to foist an emergency on itself.\n\nThe constitution of a political party if followed faithfully, provides for how to handle every development. On the other hand, making a governor to lead a party even for just one day is inappropriate because there is no way such functioning will not adversely affect the running of a state which the governor was elected to govern.\n\nBesides, the spirit behind the country\u2019s constitutional provision which insulates presidents and governors from litigation was to ensure that nothing distracts them any day from performing their executive functions. To that extent, governors should be encouraged to concentrate on governance.\n\nIs there a strong correlation between being an elected executive and the capacity to effectively run a political party structure? If not, why are governors always put forward by their parties to perform party functions?\n\nAs we saw in the recent national convention of the PDP which was a purely party function, it was committees led by state governors elected under the banner of the party that organized it. Consequently, it is not irrational to agree with the criticism that Nigerian political parties patronize the strategy so as to get their members in government to use public funds to finance their party activities.\n\nOur contention however, is that a good political party administrator can raise far more resources for the party through a pragmatic arrangement for the collection of membership dues from the acclaimed millions of party members. Many politicians are so wobbled in thought that they feel it is better to divert public funds to the parties. What makes a person a member of a party if he/she cannot be persuaded to pay low membership dues that virtually everyone can afford?\n\nThe combination of all that has been said so far is that ours is not yet a democracy. In a proper democracy, apart from emblems and logos, party identification is a major distinguishing factor; making it virtually impossible for strange bed fellows to belong to same political groupings.\n\nIt is in earnest unusual for leftist politicians to belong to rightist parties. But in Nigeria, it is not only normal, it has become so notorious that it is no longer easy to understand which political party certain politicians now belong to having incessantly moved around.\n\nThere is also the joke that a \u2018decampee\u2019 would so disparage the party he left the previous day as if he was never there, yet would return there some months later and be applauded for it. This inadvertently shows disregard for political parties by politicians who are products of the parties.\n\nWe have two other examples which show the deliberate weakening of political parties by their privileged members. The first is the enactment of bogus laws by State Houses of Assembly to empower governors to dissolve local councils in breach of the constitutional directive for local governments to be run by democratically elected officials. The second is the recent decision by the federal legislature to impose direct primaries on parties through the instrumentality of an amendment to the electoral law. While there is nothing particularly unusual with direct primaries, imposing the mode on the parties confirms that politicians do not want their parties to be viable entities with a set of initiatives and discretion to select what best suits a particular circumstance.\n\nYet, the same politicians keep asking the judiciary to refrain from determining party cases which the internal structure of the parties should be allowed to handle. If a political party cannot be trusted to exercise sufficient wisdom to select the most suited mode of primaries for certain times and environments, why should anything be left to the party to superintend? In other words, the National Assembly has decided to turn political parties into robots who are incapable of reasoning.\n\nWe are not unaware of the advantages of direct primaries. Our point is that direct primaries also have disadvantages. The best way to deal with such issues is to avoid replacing the thinking caps of elected party executives with those of law makers.\n\nWhy can\u2019t every segment be given a chance to grow and develop in line with global realities when some jurisdictions allow the so-called indirect mode at general elections whereas Nigerian lawmakers are unable to allow it for party internal processes?\n\nUnfortunately, the argument that it was done to curtail the powers of governors is also not persuasive because one of the worst forms of law is one whose enactment targets specific individuals. What is more, our governors know what to do to control any mode of primary elections.\n\nIt seems more reasonable to create strong political parties whose elected executives should be respected instead of the present arrangement in which party executives grovel at the feet of prosperous elected government officials.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Direct primary and controversial Electoral Act",
          "text": "It is curious that in their squabble over direct or other types of primaries, governors and National Assembly members have bickered only from the point of view of the advantages or disadvantages the preferred mode of primary confers. President Muhammadu Buhari has till December 19 to assent the new Electoral Act passed by the legislature and forwarded to him last month. He is said to be still widely consulting in order to determine his course of action. Even the other significant aspect of the Act, to wit, electronic relay of voting results has not been as contentious. The mode of primary has been contentious since governors outwitted legislators during the last congresses, almost rendering them of no significance whatsoever. Scorned and stripped of power, they angrily produced a bill and came out with a hammer blow to the governors, knocking them off their proud perch, and reminding them that it takes two to tango. The governors were thus knocked insensate and left seeking means to regain their composure.\n\nThe president may be consulting widely, as his aides say warily, but in reality he is only trying to see whether he can safely defy the governors and put his signature to the amendment. Indeed, he may be juggling whose fury he can safely defy in the last months of his presidency, whether the governors who would soon become lame duck like him, or lawmakers who had lent their honour and integrity to sustain him through many shortsighted and indecent bills and expenditures. He will of course prefer to keep both combatants jumping contentedly before his throne, and running after the ball at his whistle; but because the fighters have dug their heels in, he may increasingly find it difficult to have his cake and eat it. Sooner or later, indeed in the days ahead, the president will have to decide, and one side will be offended.\n\nThere is animated talk about the legislature overriding the president\u2019s veto and passing the amendment into law. Should the legislature opt for this peremptory action, they will not have offended the provisions of the constitution. But given their nature, and how long and steadily they had subordinated themselves to the presidency, it is unfathomable that they would feel somewhat reckless and adventurous. They are angry with what the governors did during the last congresses, and have sought for opportunity, no matter how small, to put those proud and imperious state executives in their place, but to override the president\u2019s veto is a different ball game. It would be uncharacteristic, nay, it would be revolutionary. But this class of lawmakers hates revolutions. In fact they loathe treason. And to them revolution is indistinguishable from treason.\n\nBut it is possible theoretically that the president might withhold assent. It will not be because he thinks clearly about the futuristic implication of the amendment, but because of whether he likes or dislikes those who stand to gain from the amendment in the short or long run. The presidency\u2019s calculations are characteristically bizarre and inscrutable. It\u2019s no use trying to make sense of them. Should he withhold assent, the legislators are unlikely to angrily confront him and override his veto. They do not have that precedent. Instead they will dutifully visit him in his office, explain their discomforts with his action, excoriate the governors all over again, taking care to drape them in the devil\u2019s cape, and remind him that the beauty and demands of democracy impel everyone to side with direct primary. The lawmakers must, however, hope that the governors, who have also tried to outdo the legislature in groveling before the president, do not visit Aso Villa hard on their heels. Should that happen, and given the dilatoriness of the presidency, the final decision will be a toss-up.\n\nIf the president feels sufficiently unnerved by the governors, and is also chary of inciting the lawmakers into unaccustomed disrespect of his office, he will try one of his trademark disingenuous compromises. The president is characteristically monarchical, but in recent months, he has ameliorated his peacock intransigence. He will, therefore, call for a truce, get the governors and the lawmakers to find common ground, find excuses to return the amendment to the legislature for some extra tweaking, and then, with a shout of eureka, get a version worthy of his assent but which neither pleases the hare nor placates the hounds. The controversy and lobbying are intense, but as far as the president is concerned, it is a storm in a tea cup. He really does not need both sides; they both need him. He retains sufficient predatory power to frighten them into reluctant acquiescence. If he growls at them, especially deploying the subtle threat of anti-corruption war, they will recoil into their shells or quake in their boots.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut as humiliating as it may seem, should the president defy the governors and go along with the legislators, he will very likely get his way with little or no repercussion. He is not seeking third term, and can in fact not seek it, and he has no signature and futuristic bill waiting for their support through constitutional amendment. If he lends them a listening ear, it is simply to massage their brittle ego and keep them happy. If he chooses not to lend them a listening ear, there is little they can do to punish him. He is too lofty in his perch for them to inflict their usual insouciance. They are sometimes frustrated by his detachment and perhaps acute lack of depth, but since they themselves lack vision, almost to a man, they will feel less inclined to importune him on the esoteric issues of a great country in a great continent in a competitive world. The lawmakers may even quibble with the president over the fine details of the amendment, but the governors will simply try to paint a horrifying picture of the lawmakers and the unconvincing consequences of direct primary.\n\nNeither the presidency, nor the governors, nor yet the legislature is likely to look at the amendment within the grander context of who should determine what mode of primary to use in nominating candidates for party and state and national offices. Neither of the three is capable of the selflessness and grandeur the idea requires. Once they identify a problem today, especially a problem that rubs them up the wrong way, they angrily excise it. Having spent decades bureaucratising political parties in Nigeria, starting with the meddlesome two-party structure legislated during the Ibrahim Babangida military dictatorship, Nigerian governments have tended to see the parties as an extension of public service. Otherwise, why on earth would an APC-controlled National Assembly impose a primary mode on all parties in the country? What business do they have doing that? The issue of course is not what mode of primary is the best. That is nonsense: they all have their advantages and disadvantages. The main issue is what mode of primary a political party, or indeed a state chapter, wants. Once that is decided, then that is it. If a party does not show fidelity to its own rules, then that lack of discipline can be litigated. But to legislate and impose one mode of primary on everyone, regardless of its advantages, is irrational and meddlesome. Imposing a mode of primary, as the National Assembly has discourteously done to put proud governors\u2019 noses out of joint, is a disrespectful way to fight one\u2019s enemies.\n\nFinally, White Paper on EndSARS\n\nReassuringly, two facts came out of the judicial panel report to probe, among other things, the protest and shootings at the Lekki Tollgate during last year\u2019s EndSARS protests. One, the leaked report of the panel\u2019s investigations and conclusions was, minus a few typographical errors, the same as the one officially submitted to the Lagos State government. When this column commented on the leaked report some two weeks ago, it was obvious the reports were the same, but it was still safe to cast doubt on its authenticity in order to give the panel the benefit of the doubt. Two, given the massive propaganda that accompanied the leaked report and the insidious purpose to which it was aimed, there were doubts that Lagos could find the courage to treat the official report with the boldness and dispassion it merited. Thankfully, Lagos was unsparing.\n\nOn the Lekki Tollgate angle of the report, the White Paper treated the panel\u2019s findings on their merit. Lagos did not need to go outside the report to substantiate its White Paper. It is pointless going over the contradictions, speculations and assumptions in the judicial panel report. These were treated in this place two weeks ago, and much more disturbing details regarding the insufficiency of the report are already before the public. What is clear is that the report itself is its own worst enemy. No one needs to go outside it to hang it. A few activists and lawyers, some of whom had not even read the full report before taking issue with it, insist on believing their own version of the truth. But more and more, after reading and digesting the report, many critics and commentators have beaten a tactical retreat, remorsefully convinced that there is nothing in the report to redeem it.\n\nThe White Paper examined all the panel\u2019s recommendations, accepted 11 fully, accepted six with modifications, rejected one, and regarded some 14 other recommendations as falling outside its purview. Lagos did not obfuscate in determining the reliability of the report. As far as it was concerned the panel\u2019s fact-finding methods were riddled with contradictions and speculations, and its conclusions largely tangential to its findings. Did those who leaked the report realise the report\u2019s failings and wished to remedy it by propaganda and threats? It is not clear. What is, however, indisputable is that there is nothing anyone can say or prove from the panel\u2019s report that will convince the pro-massacre crowd that crimes against humanity did not occur last year at the Lekki Tollgate. Most of them have not read the report, but they are unshakeable in their faith as to what transpired at the scene. Even the few who have read the report distrust government so passionately that they regard the failings of the panel\u2019s report and the contradictions contained in it as both a minor inconvenience and a product of the state and federal government\u2019s shenanigans. Head or tail, the government could not win, the weakness of the findings notwithstanding.\n\nIt was, therefore, surprising that Lagos offered an olive branch to a few activists who swore opposition to the White Paper before it was issued. They had made up their minds so conclusively that even if they were to be confronted with Pythagoras theorem that states that \u201cIn a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides\u201c, they would not be convinced. Indeed, they would regard it as state trickery and treason to the human cause. It is time Lagos moved beyond some of these opinion moulders, many of whom live by social media influencing, and whose self-importance is anchored on conjured stories designed to massage their own egos regardless of the pain to the general community. In the Lekki Tollgate affair, there is nothing to indicate that these activists, who have stuck stubbornly to lies and conjurations, are more important than the majority who are convinced from the panel\u2019s report that nine people did not die at the Tollgate, and that in any case, their death, even if proven, is not more important or hideous than the other 90 who died elsewhere during the protests.\n\nThe agitations over the panel report and the White Paper will taper off into nothingness as the months go by. A group of parents \u2013 it is not clear how many they are \u2013 are reported to have sought legal representation to continue the fight against the federal and state governments over the tollgate shootings. Did they present themselves before the panel during its one-year sitting, and were they able to prove anything, as evidenced by the panel\u2019s report itself? Somehow, they believe they can upturn the panel report and convince everyone that their children and relations were shot dead at the Lekki Tollgate last year. They must hope that they can withstand fierce cross-examination in the courts. However, they must be encouraged to litigate the matter, present all the evidence they can get, and do their best to support their case. The public can\u2019t wait; for then propaganda would be differentiated from reality, and fact from fiction.\n\nAs many activists have shown in the Lekki Tollgate matter, social media is a devastating instrument to propagate lies, falsify facts, incite insurrection, and colour reality. It was deployed to dramatic and paralysing effect last year, to the point of convincing the unwary. Till today, many leading opinion moulders in the country still believe there was a massacre at the Lekki Tollgate, regardless of absolute lack of evidence, and many young social media influencers have secured foreign trips, visas, asylums and recognition on the ashes of misrepresenting and calumniating Nigeria. There is no dissuading them. There will always be \u2018deplorables\u2019 who use the social media for dangerous causes, and there will always be anti-establishment \u2018gullibles\u2019 who believe everything they read on social media. Instead of according hysterical activists respect and deferring to their assertiveness, it is the responsibility of offended parties, in this case, the government, to match the activists post for post, and noise for noise. They cannot incite with untruths and get away with murder; they must always be held accountable.\n\nThe judicial panel report was deeply controversial because of its suppositions and indefensible conclusions. The White Paper is not. But the EndSARS aftermath will not be easily dispelled. Lagos will implement 11 recommendations; it remains to be seen whether the federal government, whose agencies triggered the crisis in the first instance, will take care of its own side of the equation. The country is badly structured, and the security agencies have become antiquated, inefficient, and even incompetent and brutal. There is nothing to suggest that the federal government is truly remorseful over what has happened nor has it learnt anything from the crisis. Everything suggests that they saw EndSARS as an affront, and whatever they condescend to do eventually might end up being cosmetic. The system is too stupefying to allow them the flexibility and humility to tinker with the country\u2019s structure. With many youths disaffected at a time of poor governance and declining economy, alienation might very well increase until there is another fire. That next fire may not be easily put out.",

          "text": "A former governor of Anambra State,Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, as well as others have advised the Southeast region to persuade other regions to support them to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nThey said this on Saturday at the United For Better Nigeria Initiative (UBNI) National Convention in Abuja.\n\nFormer Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, said that it is neither a right nor legal for the southeast to demand the presidency.\n\nAnyim said that they had to persuade other regions to support their dream if they would produce a president in 2023.\n\n\u201cIs it right for the Southeast to produce the next president? My answer is legally no, and the reason is that the constitution is clear, the constitution says every Nigerian of 40 years is entitled to aspire for that office.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cOn the other side, morally is it right? Is it an entitlement? I will say yes because the federal character principle enshrined in the constitution encourages rotation.\n\n\u201cThe reason I have to make this clarification is that when the right you have is not legal, the only approach and the instrument you have is persuasion.\n\n\u201cSo the approach, the language will be to persuade others to see reason with you that morally they should support you to take a turn since it rotates.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Southeast group seeks Middle Belt partnership for president\n\nAnyim therefore encouraged the Southeast that as they go ahead with the movement of advocating for a president, it should be with an attitude of persuasion.\n\nAccording to Ezeife, the kind of Nigeria God wanted when He created Nigeria was for her to develop into a super power among nations, and raise respect and dignity for all blacks on earth.\n\nHe said that one of the ways to achieve the feats the nation wanted was to carry everybody along without discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo I found Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and other groups in this place talking about the need for federal character. If you do it that way, there will be unity, if there is fairness, equity, justice, you will have unity and progress.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of those, you see where we are now. It is not a matter of give us president, we don\u2019t give, you have to work for it, the Igbo does not prostrate.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man does not keel down but this time, we are prepared to kneel down to every part of Nigeria, every group, every ethnic group in Nigeria, we are prepared to even prostrate because we believe in this country.\u201d\n\nEzeife said that Igbo people had contributed greatly to the development of Nigeria in terms of infrastructure, intellect and business.\n\nHe therefore said that it was time to give Igbo people the chance to build Nigeria to the standard God wanted it.\n\nMrs Nkolika Mkparu ,Coordinator-General, UBNI, said that there was a feeling of political marginalisation after over a century (by 2023) the Southeast region is yet to produce a president.\n\nMkparu said that UBNI, a non-partisan political advocacy group, which had been involved in enlightenment for a united Nigeria deemed it fit to beam searchlight on the issue.\n\nShe said that in achieving this political balance, the support from the Southeast region alone would not suffice; therefore there is the need to appeal to other regions to support it.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that our strongest strengths are from the north, our great leaders are from the north, so we are working with the whole nation with the understanding that inclusiveness is what will lead Nigeria to a better future.\n\n\u201cInclusiveness that will bring us together in one union is what will bring our country together.\n\n\u201cNigeria is huge enough for everybody, Nigeria has the capacity to hold everybody, Nigeria has the intellectuals, Nigeria has all it takes to lift the county, all we are asking for is to give the southeast also a chance to lead.\n\n\u201cAll the other parts have tried, Southsouth has tried, North has tried, West has tried for over 50 years now, so we are hoping that we should be allowed to try.\u201d\n\nThe Guest Speaker, Prof. Mutiullahi Olasupo, who is the Director of Institute for Peace Leadership and Development Studies, University of Abuja, said that it was right for the southeast to produce the next president in the interest of peace and natural law of justice.\n\nHe said it was imperative for all Nigerians to exclusively resolve that the presidency in 2023 should go to the southeast.\n\nHe said that the same mechanism that produced former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999, should also repeat itself by 2023, to produce a president from the south east.\n\n\u201cOut of all the six geo-political zones in this country, it is only the southeast that has not produced the president in this country.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean that the south east is not being recognized as a geopolitical zone in Nigeria?\u201d he asked.",

I have people around me who sleep with men for money but I stood my ground not to do any despicable thing to get money in spite my hardship! I must confess I\u2019ve been seeing great results.\n\nIn fact, let me share my testimony, someone here may learn one or two.\n\nI was raised by my mum singlehandedly and I had the opportunity to sleep around but I never did. I\u2019m in university and in my early 20\u2019s! When I just got my admission, people never liked me simply because of the way I carried myself. Guys never liked me! It appears I disgusted them because I would say no to them and their ungodly relationships that includes sex and every other thing that God won\u2019t be happy with. I kept standing my grounds and trusting God but, today I can say that I am seeing the hands of God in everything I do. People who hated me now like me, even ladies who were once sleeping with men are now coming to me to learn how to be good. By the grace of God, I have never attracted ungodly men to me. This is one advantage of being sold out to God.\n\nLastly, I recently unveiled my new book about what people need to know before going into a relationship to avoid mistakes that\u2019d damage their destinies.\n\nThank you mummy for your continuous hopeful messages, your messages here are indeed helping me preserve myself till my wedding night. I love you mummy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNkechi\n\nWow! What a beautiful message! I dare say you\u2019ve not seen anything yet! God is going to bombard you with great signs and wonders and showcase you as a classic example of the rewards of righteousness!\n\nMy darling, precious, glorious, dignified, world-famous and heavenly celebrated Nigerian daughters, I must let you know that almost on a daily basis, I\u2019m inundated with messages from distressed ladies especially single mothers with tales of woe from their experience with their baby fathers! I can\u2019t but shake my head in pity and wish they made better choices! To start with, I thank God for those who refused to abort pregnancies but I must say a lot of girls/ladies are not going to fulfil God\u2019s wonderful plans for them because they scattered their lives settings with their own hands! Too many girls/ladies out there already have deep-seated ancestral battles to deal with and a lot to contend with because of the type of star they carry then they worsen matters by inviting strange spirits which will further sink their destinies through ungodly sex!\n\nA lot of you have super-duper destinies such that if God opened your eyes to see the wonder He has created you to be, you probably would be out of human reach and be alone with God so as not to be desecrated. What more? The greater your star/destiny, the greater your battles! When the scriptures also tell us that in these days- the last days, evil men and seducers will wax stronger (2 Timothy 3:13) i.e. will go from bad to worse, which power do you have to confront them? Your Brazilian hair, pink pouts, sexy dress or numerous poses on snapchat, Instagram and facebook? Hmm\u2026To worsen matters, engaging in ungodly sex which not only places too many demonic baggage on your destiny, makes you spiritually dull and could paralyze it. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER! It practically destroys your spiritual connectivity with God and opens up your life to demonic invasion. 1 Peter 2:11\n\nSadly, more often than not, the female folk are at the receiving end. When an unwanted pregnancy happens, the girl is at the receiving end whether she keeps it or terminates it-which is even worse. When you get married to the wrong person as a result of confusion arising from premarital sex, spiritual blindness etc. and you begin to experience hell on earth, become a punching bag and get abused in all forms when you are God\u2019s royal diadem and meant to be the best thing that happened to a man, you bear the brunt and would be lectured by those who have no idea of what your destiny entails to fix perhaps the devil re-incarnate or a home that was never meant to be yours! Who sent you there? How can you pursue your glorious original destiny with the wrong people in your life?\n\nWhat a big, big waste of time and destiny? I could go on and on on how premarital sex could throw your destiny off balance! What\u2019s the rush anyway? Don\u2019t be fooled by the guys out there, they don\u2019t want leftovers! How you present yourself now would very much determine how they\u2019d treat you- even in marriage!\n\nStay chaste, stay chaste, stay chaste till your wedding night!!! Stop messing around with your life! May it continue to be well with you in Jesus name!\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nChastity does not belong to the past. It saves you a lot of trouble, preserves your beautiful destiny and stands you out from the crowd. You are better off not engaging in pre-marital and extra-marital sex.

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nChairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum and governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has said that Nigeria must restructure now to have stability, growth and development.\n\nHe spoke to some journalists in Sokoto on a wide range of issues, including what his administration is doing to stop flashes of insecurity in the state. Excerpt:\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nYou operated at the national level as a Speaker of the House of Representatives and now you are the governor of your state; what is the experience like being at the national level and coming back home as governor?\n\nThank you very much for this opportunity and welcome to Sokoto. It is like you are talking about two different worlds; the House of Representatives at the National Assembly and then Sokoto State. In the House of Representatives, you have representations from 306 constituencies of Nigeria who are from different and diverse backgrounds. Coming with them are different degrees of experiences; some definitely older than you, some with more academic laurels than you, some richer and wealthier than you and some younger than you. But all are holding equal mandate representing their constituencies with different worldviews and perspectives on issues and all of that. Here in Sokoto, one can say that the people in the state are largely from the same background even though you have the Fulani, Hausa, Zabarmawa, some Kanuris and other Nigerians that are here living with us. It is not the same with what you have at the National Assembly. When you talk about leading the two, where, by the grace of God and the support of my colleagues, I served as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and here that I am serving currently as governor in the last six years, they are different. First is the constitutional role and second, you are dealing with two different sets of people if I may put it that way. Yes, even here, some people are richer than me, some are more educated, but in terms of close contact and micromanaging, it is a different ball game. At the House of Representatives, you are first among equals as the Speaker, but in the state, it is not the same scenario. In the state, you are the chief executive, so it is a different scenario and not as if you are just first among equals. That alone tells you that the experiences are not the same. As governor, I can say you deal more closely with the minutest of issues. As governor, if somebody\u2019s wife has a stillbirth, they say it is you; if their tap is running, they say it is the governor. So, it is not the same experience either as a parliamentarian at that level or even as a Speaker. That is why I said they are two different worlds and experiences. That relationship, solidarity and working together like school mates exists at the House unlike here where I am the chief executive virtually; minus my deputy who was elected alongside with me, every other person is my appointee. It is part of what I am missing and, of course, the debate. Most times at the House, you are always talking about national and bigger issues.\n\nSecurity is gradually becoming an issue in Sokoto which hitherto used to be one of the most peaceful states in the country. What is really happening and what is your administration doing to curb the menace?\n\nWell, before you ask me what is happening and what I am doing to curtail it, I will give you a background of how we got to where we are at the moment. Unfortunately, Zamfara State has been the epicenter of banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest. Most of the states including Niger really are getting the heat from Zamfara. And what is the distance of Zamfara to Sokoto? Almost about 14 local governments are either neighbouring Zamfara or Niger Republic. And what is happening in the Sahel region, which of course includes Mali, Niger and Central Africa is permeating and creeping into Nigeria. Talking about banditry, ISWAP and all of that, all these agents of instability that are carrying out activities in the Sahel region have a way of finding themselves through our porous borders into Nigeria. So, one by geography as neighbours to Niger Republic is part of the problem and secondly being neighbour to Zamfara, the epicenter of banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest. And to a large extent, especially recently, the inability of the security agents or agencies to coordinate their efforts and operations in Zamfara against our own advice by governors of eight states. We have met the president several times in the last three, four years. We even advised Service Chiefs that whenever you decide to undertake this large scale operation, let it be simultaneous. Have a blocking force in parts of Kaduna, Niger, Kebbi, Katsina and Sokoto, and carry out the operations simultaneously. They did not do that. Secondly, the timing for operation at the peak of the rainy season. One is that the forest is thick; two is that the military and other security agencies do not have the equipment that can move into those difficult terrains. That also did not help matters. So, whenever they carry out an operation and attack on the bandits in the camps, they pander towards states that are close to Zamfara. Instead of the security agencies to get them and do away with them in Zamfara, they disperse them into our state. And most of those that came in to attack our people are as a result of those operations recently. Another also is the fact that as I said before, they do not have enough manpower, firepower and equipment to carry out the operations. So, it is not as if it was about the people of Sokoto State. It is more to do with the situation of our neighbours. Then when you talk about what we have done, there has been a lot of synergy among the agencies in Sokoto State. I must commend the security agencies. We have been working together with them with regards to addressing the challenges. We do the much we can and we are still doing a lot because there was never a time any of the agencies approached us for support without getting it. In the last four, five years, we had given out not less than 500 vehicles to security services in Sokoto State. It is on record. How many states have done that? And as I said, we pay them their allowances from our coffers; we are up to date in paying those allowances. I believe you can check what I am going to tell you. We have refurbished all the divisional police headquarters. We are building about 12 new ones for them. So, we have given them every support. We are not sleeping; we have a standing committee that was established under his Eminence (you know he is a retired General), that is also working on the issue of security in the state. We hold regular security meetings. Even two, three days ago, we held one when we took a decision on outlawing self-styled vigilante groups because they were part of the problems in Zamfara State. Again, you know the limitations of every governor in Nigeria. So, for everybody to imagine it as if a governor is not doing what he ought to do, nobody can do what I have told you. I have not seen any governor who has taken a matchete and not to talk of a gun and pursued a bandit or Boko Haram in the bush. At best, it is to support the security agencies and the IDPs.\n\nAre there plans for a regional outfit to contain the insecurity situation?\n\nI told you that over the years, four, five years ago, we had Northern governors meeting and we had Nigerian governors meeting and we have had sub-regional meetings. At a point in time, each of us contributed N100 million for operations to be carried out in the affected areas. And for those neighbouring Niger Republic, we have also been having meetings with our colleagues from Niger Republic; we go there and they come here. So, it is not as if we have not been having regional cooperation. On the issue of forming a regional outfit, we have not discussed that because of the perception problem associated with that. But what we have done and we are working with the security agencies is that we try to strengthen our vigilantes at every state level and allow them to work with the security services. The Amotekun or Ebubeagu are not better than the vigilante groups. They are just a similar version of the vigilantes. What we are doing is putting them under some training by the police and then supporting the security services.\n\nSouthern governors met and said that the 2023 presidency should come from the South, and we know that you may want to join the race in the next general election, what is your view on that?\n\nLet me tell you this; I think we need to get that clear. When you look at my history, I find it difficult to talk about zoning. First, when I got to the House of Representatives in 2003, the ANPP caucus was not comfortable with the leadership style of the then leader of the caucus, the minority leader of the House. Sometime in 2005, there was a change in leadership and at that time, the ANPP had zoned the four principal officers\u2019 positions as follows; Minority Leader, Kano, Kaduna; Whip, Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara; Deputy Leader, Borno, Yobo because that was where you had ANPP; and Deputy Whip to South-south. We had Etiebet from Akwa Ibom. Based on that arrangement, the leaders of the ANPP caucus emerged. When members felt they were no longer comfortable with Dr Salik Ahmed Salik and there was a change, they themselves altered the zoning arrangement. Don Etiebet, the then chairman of the party issued a statement disagreeing with members of the House of Representatives that they must go back to zoning. Meanwhile, the rules of the House provided that the leadership should emerge from among members. So, relying on that, nobody carried out the change of guard and I came; even though I came from the bloc that was supposed to be the Whip of the House by the arrangement of the ANPP caucus, I became the leader against zoning. In 2011, the PDP zoned the Speakership position to the Southwest, but members of the House of Reps came together to say look, we are looking for a Speaker with so and so qualities. They approached me and all that went on, and I emerged the Speaker of the House; not from the Southwest. Clearly from the two scenarios, based on the assessment of members, and in their own criteria the type of leader they were looking for, I enjoyed those two privileges in the past. That is why I said that based on my history, I find it difficult to talk about zoning. But when you talk about what my brother governors from the South said, they are entitled to their opinion. When the Northern governors met in Kaduna, they said their own. But it is now for the political parties to sit down, look at the issues and plan how to win elections. The bottom-line for any political party is how to win elections. When you are talking about democracy and elections, you must think about demography; where are you going to get the votes?\n\nWill you again join the presidential race in 2023?\n\nWhy are you asking me that question?\n\nYou know that in 2018, I participated in the PDP primaries that held in Port Harcourt and I thank God that I came second. Several people are talking to me to give it a trial. At this moment, what I can tell you is that very soon, I am going to commence my consultations and whatever is the feedback I get and with prayers, I will let my position be known.\n\nThe Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission has been going around to change their ratings for states; are you happy with where Sokoto is on the table?\n\nIt is not about Sokoto. No state is happy with where it is. Not even Lagos or Rivers; so, if Lagos and Rivers are not happy with where they are, how do you want Sokoto and others to feel? We are all looking for money and resources. Not even the Federal Government is happy with where it is. They have the lion share, but they are looking for resources. Go and ask them; they borrow money to pay salaries. So, it is not about Sokoto, but what people have been talking about the need for restructuring and devolution of powers in the country. We must review and restructure away all those things from the centre. I said it at the PDP retreat. It is first our pathway to stability, growth and development. The Federal Government must shed weight and devolve more powers to sub-nationals where the people are in the states and local governments. That would give less attraction to the centre. Let the Federal Government be dealing with issues of immigration and other normal issues that a federal system should be concerned about.\n\nThere are still many big ongoing projects in your state when you have less than two more years to go; do you think you will be able to finish the projects with the time available to you or will you leave some of them as \u2018abandoned projects\u2019?\n\nAre you worried about the timing or the resources? Minus any unforeseen developments, as we say in law, Force Majeure (COVID-19 was a Force Majeure as it slowed down a lot of things in the world), I can assure you by the grace of God, all of the projects you have seen and those you have not seen are going to be completed by this administration. About timelines, that is why we are committed and we have resources that we are working hard to ensure that we complete all the projects.\n\nHave you been able to improve the Internally Generated Revenue(IGR) of the state since you came in?\n\nWe have. It was very low until recently because we have introduced a lot of reforms with the state revenue services. We have new laws and rates that we are charging and the management has been turned around. And the level of awareness has been raised that you have to have more money for government to be able to carry out its responsibilities. And the confidence of the people to have a buy in, in generating more revenue is also increased because in the past, they were worried and concerned about whether people would agree to introducing rates or taxes because there was not that confidence that the resources would be judiciously used; and the prudence of management of resources we have been able to do in the past. This is a state where we do not owe salaries, pension and we are still doing what we are doing. Members of the public are aware that we are not squandering their scarce resources. We are micro-managing and managing the resources effectively. So, they are getting value for whatever taxes they are paying. The trust level of the people on the government has been increased.\n\nYou are not owing and projects are going on; people would ask, how are you getting the resources?\n\nAs I said initially, the key to the whole thing is planning; we plan how to raise money and part of it is the management of what we get from IGR and with augmentation from some loans that we have from both banks and other financial institutions. And most of it, are payable within the lifespan of this administration. You know that banks and financial institutions would not lend money to you unless they are sure that you are healthy and that you can carry it. In any case, they would do the background check to assess and even agree to endorse your request. So, it is a combination of the resources from the FAC, IGR loans from banks and financial institutions.\n\nIs there a reason that you have consistently allocated more funds to education and health sectors of your state?\n\nYou know that the indices on education development of Sokoto State are not encouraging. By the time we came in, we had about 1.6 million out of school children. Also, the indices in our healthcare are not good. So, we did that as a deliberate measure to upscale the quality, numeracy of education in the state, and to address the challenges of Almajarai and out of school. Yes, because, it is when they are out of school that they engage in all forms of criminality. It is because of this that we decided as a government that we must give priority to education and human capital development. Second, healthcare is of paramount importance. Without a healthy society, you cannot go anywhere. As I have said, the indices have not been good. At a point in time even before I came in, so many of our development partners had written us off because of their experience with the immediate past administration in terms of collaboration, partnership in working together to address some of these challenges in healthcare. By the time we came in, they saw that yes, these are people they could actually do business with. They came back and we assembled experts both in education, healthcare and agriculture. In dealing with our tertiary institutions under education, we set up a committee under Prof Attahiru Jega who advised us on the way to manage our tertiary institutions. So, the reports from these committees, guided and are still guiding our steps in the education sector; be it at basic, secondary or tertiary level. The same thing happened and is happening in healthcare and so also in agriculture. So, we saw the gaps and challenges and the need to really do more in education and healthcare. That is why we have been consistently prioritizing education, healthcare and agriculture in that order.\n\nDid the committees you set up lead to the establishment of the Child Rights Act in your state?\n\nThe Child Rights Act has been on the card and table of virtually every government, year in, year out, time in, time out, even in Sokoto State. The Child Rights Act was passed by the National Assembly in 2004. It was not passed because of certain considerations that had to do with culture, religion and belief of the people. So, we had to do a lot of sensitization with the Ulamas, religious leaders and community leaders under the able leadership and guidance of His eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto. It was for us to convince members of the public that look, nobody is trying to Westernise your child by passing the Child Rights law; that was how we were able to build the consensus for us to be able to pass it at the Executive Council level.\n\nBut do you foresee problems in enforcing it?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nAs I said during the signing ceremony, all of the concerns have been addressed by the committee. It is not as if we adopted the Act the way it was without attempting to fine-tune and domesticate it in consonance with the culture and religion of the people. So, I do not see any difficulties. By the way, before even we signed that law, I believe that Sokoto was either the first or very first states in Nigeria to sign a law that made basic education compulsory to every child. So, it is not as if Sokoto is new to it or that the whole idea is coming as a new thing to Sokoto State. We have the contributory health scheme. When you talk about health insurance like Sokoto communities especially, for those who have different understanding of it in terms of Islamic perspective, it is always difficult to convince people to do that. But we were able to do that with the guidance of His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto and other religious leaders to fine-tune the health insurance laws and make them adaptable to our own situation and we came up with the contributory health scheme. So, it is all about the approach and how you engage the people, how you sensitise and make them to understand and have a buy in of what you are trying to market to them. It also has a lot to do with their trust in the administration.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Peter Anosike\n\nAviation industry stakeholders have raised a red flag on the planned concession of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos; Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja; Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, and the Port Harcourt International Airport, Rivers State by the Federal Government.\n\nThe stakeholders are worried that the government is looking at concessioning the airports to foreign firms while there are tested indigenous firms that can do the job efficiently.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to them, besides the capital flight associated with using expatriate firms, the Federal Government may be unwittingly compromising the nation\u2019s security.\n\nThe airports, the stakeholders pointed out, are the gateway to every country, arguing that the architecture and operations of \u201csuch assets should be handled by nationals who have the security interest of the country at heart.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with newsmen, Mustapha Bello, a retired engineer with the defunct Nigeria Airways, advised that security and national interest should be the first consideration when handling national assets.\n\nHis words: \u201cNigeria should not forget the experience of Uganda during the reign of the late General Idi Amin.\n\n\u201cThe Entebbe raid was successfully carried out because the Israelis had the architectural plan of the Uganda Entebbe International Airport in their palm.\n\n\u201cSince there are some Nigerian companies who have successfully operated airports terminals like Bi-Courtney Aviation Services, who are currently running Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal 2, MMA2, Lagos, they should be considered first.\n\n\u201cThere is another successful Nigerian whose company is operating at the Gatwick Airport in United Kingdom, UK. Such companies owned by Nigerians should be considered first \u201c.\n\nAlso, another official of a Lagos-based aviation company, who pleaded anonymity, noted that indigenization of national assets is \u201cvery important in order to create jobs for the teeming population and prevent capital flight.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, it is necessary for the airports to be concessioned to local firms with track records, merit and competence, rather than foreign companies that you cannot vouch for.\n\n\u201cSome of the foreign companies being touted don\u2019t even have the required records.\n\n\u201cBi-Courtney Aviation Services, BASL, has proved to be the best private terminal manager in the last 14 years and so should be supported by government because of its antecedent in terminal management.\n\n\u201cLuckily, I was informed that they also bid for the terminals to be concessioned\u201d.\n\nWhen reminded that Bi-Courtney had been locked in legal battle with the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and consequently, the Federal Government may be biased against the company in the bidding process, he said that most of the legal issues at MMA2 had been resolved in favour of BASL.\n\n\u201cThe late President Musa Yar \u2018Adua set up a reconciliation committee that resolved most of the disputed sections of the concession agreement.\n\n\u201cOn MMA2 terminal, as a stakeholder in the aviation sector, I learnt that from the outset, both parties, BASL and the Federal Government, set up a coordinating committee comprising BASL, FAAN and an independent body to address any challenge that may arise from the agreement on MMA2.\n\n\u201cOn each occasion that the committee was called to address some of the challenges emanating from the concession, judgments have been in favour of BASL,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had recently announced that at the end of the submission of interest to bid for the four international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano, some foreign companies also submitted bids.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that some of the foreign bidders in the process are said to be creating problems as they have been accused of breaching the process.\n\nAgain, Femi Falana\u2019s Chambers had written Sirika, alleging that three of the foreign bidders for the four airports to be concessioned violated the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (Est.) Act 2005 and the National Policy on Public-Private Partnership (N4P).\n\nThe law firm, therefore, called for the disqualification of the three firms from the bidding process to avoid litigation, which might derail the exercise.\n\nIn a letter signed by the legal firm to the Aviation Minister entitled: \u2018Request to Disqualify TAV Consortium, GMR Consortium, and ADP\u2019, it said it had confirmed that two consortia owned by ADP submitted an expression of interest.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cThe first consortium was led by TAV Airport Holding (where ADP owns 49 per cent) and the second submission was done by GMR Airports Limited (where ADP owns 46 per cent).\n\n\u201cWe are a firm of Legal Practitioners dedicated to the defense of human rights as well as the promotion of the rule of law and Public Accountability in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to the public notice published by the Ministry of Aviation sometime in August 2021 wherein Requests for Qualification (RFO) were invited for the Concession of four Airport Terminals in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kano in accordance with the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (Est.) Act 2005 and the National Policy on Public-Private Partnership (N4P).\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that it is expressly stated in Section 2.2 of the RFQ that no applicant single or a consortium can be part of more than one bid.\n\n\u201cSection 2.2.3 is further clarifying that the eligibility shall apply to an applicant and/or to the parties consisting of the applicant i.e. shareholders.\n\n\u201cContrary to the misleading impression that both TAV and GMR are separate entities, a search on the Internet has revealed that ADP owns 46 per cent of GMR and 49 per cent of TAV.\n\n\u201cHaving contravened the Requests for Qualification (RFO) without any legal basis whatsoever, the TAV-led consortium and the GMR submission as well as ADP as a stand alone party should be disqualified from participation in the tender.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that you will accede to our request to avoid any litigation over the proposed concession of the four airports terminals\u201d.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "Former Ogun State governor and one of the top leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Olusegun Osoba has thrown his weight behind the use of direct primary as a means of selecting candidates of all political parties as contained in the newly passed Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill.\n\nAddressing a delegation of senators across political party lines and geopolitical zones of Nigeria, who visited him in London to wish him speedy recovery from a recent knee surgery, Chief Osoba, now hale and hearty, and walking up and down the staircase of his two-storey apartment, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the newly passed Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, stressing that the president is a product of direct primary.\n\nThe delegation comprised Senator Solomon Adeola (APC, Lagos West), Senator Kashim Shettima (APC, Borno Central), Senator Isah Jubril (APC, Kogi East), Senator Micheal Nnachi (PDP, Ebonyi South), Senator Ayo Akinyelure (PDP, Ondo Central), Senator Gershon Bassey (PDP, Cross River South), Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf (APC, Taraba Central), Senator Sadiq Sulaiman Umar (APC, Kwara North), Senator Tokunbo Abiru (APC, Lagos East), Senator Bashiru Ajibola (APC, Osun Central) and Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau (APC, Zamfara Central).\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIn his remarks, Osoba said: \u201cI have a feeling he will sign it. The president himself is a product of direct primary. He submitted himself to direct primary in 2019 throughout the country and heaven did not fall. After he subjected himself to direct primary throughout Nigeria in all the wards, he also subjected himself to a national convention to ratify his election at the primary. Quote me, I had cause to tell him my views at our national caucus meeting during Edo State election issue. I said \u2018Mr. President, if you can subject yourself to direct primary and national convention, I do not see why anybody should be afraid of direct primary.\u2019 I said this to him and we must be honest when we are talking to our leaders. That is why I believe that the President having been a product of direct primary will sign the law for direct primary.\u201d\n\nThe former governor stated that the 9th National Assembly had done very well for the country in supporting what it believes is right for the executive, advising the executive to pay back the National Assembly, which overwhelmingly passed the new electoral law to include direct primary.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Bans non-UK, non-Irish citizens from Nigeria\n\n*FG, Afrexim Bank intensify talks on local vaccine production\n\n*Nigeria can\u2019t be ready to produce vaccine in one year, says Tomori\n\nEjiofor Alike, Chinedu Eze in Lagos and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nFollowing the 21 cases of Omicron variant of COVID-19 reported in England, which are linked to travel from Nigeria, the United Kingdom has announced a temporary measure to prevent further cases of the virus from entering the country from 4a.m. tomorrow (Monday).\n\nUnder the new measure, which would be reviewed after three weeks, the UK will tomorrow add Nigeria to the red list of countries from where people arriving must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron strain of COVID-19, Health Secretary, Mr. Sajid Javid, said yesterday.\n\nThis implies that from 4a.m. on Monday, UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nA temporary travel ban would therefore be introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents who have been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they will be refused entry into the UK.\n\nThis does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through Nigeria while changing flights.\n\nCanada had on Tuesday banned travellers from Egypt, Nigeria and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron variant.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has, however, intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next one year, according to the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire.\n\nHowever, a renowned Virologist and Chairman of the Board of the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited, Prof. Oyewale Tomori, has told THISDAY that the local production of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country may not be possible within the next one year despite the ongoing efforts to fast-track the process.\n\nSpeaking on the UK\u2019s decision, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing said:\u201cI know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year. This decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work.\u201d\n\nUK Health Secretary, Javid also stated that travellers heading to the UK would now have to take a COVID-19 test before their departure in an effort to limit spread of the virus.\n\nHe said the tightened requirements would come into force from Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, travellers would be required to submit evidence of a negative lateral flow or PCR test to enter the UK.\n\nJavid confirmed that Nigeria would be added to the red list of countries from where people arriving the UK must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\n\nBBC reported that currently travellers only need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving the UK.\n\nJavid said the government\u2019s strategy since the discovery of the Omnicron variant had been to \u201cbuy time\u201d to assess and to \u201cput in place protective measures\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve always said that we would act swiftly should new data require it\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver the recent days we have learnt of a significant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria\n\n\u201cThere are 27 cases already in England and that\u2019s growing and Nigeria now is second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron.\n\n\u201cSo today, the government has decided to add Nigeria to the travel red list and that will be effective from 4am on Monday. This will mean that only UK residents or citizens of the UK can enter the UK from Nigeria from that point onwards, and they would have to quarantine in one of the relevant hotels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also decided to require pre-departure tests for all inward travellers that will be effective from 4am on Tuesday, and they\u2019ll be required maximum of 48 hours before the departure time,\u201d he explained.\n\nUK said the new protocol does not apply to persons \u201cstaying airside and only transiting through\u201d.\n\nJavid added the government had \u201cbeen clear that we will take action if it is necessary,\u201d adding that it was important to remember vaccinations \u201care our first line of defence\u201d and calling on people to get a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine when called to do so by the NHS.\n\nThe moves come after pressure on the government to tighten the policy had been growing over the course of the week.\n\nLast week the government\u2019s scientific advisory body Sage, said pre-departure tests for those arriving in the UK would be valuable, in the leaked minutes of a meeting seen by the BBC.\n\nThe Labour Party had previously criticised the government\u2019s current testing policy and called for the reintroduction of pre-departure tests.\n\nWhile Labour has pushed for pre-departure testing to avoid Omicron spreading, travel businesses will see it as a significant setback \u2013 just when green shoots of recovery were emerging.\n\nAirlines have supported the red list re-introduction and extension.\n\nBut they view the introduction of blanket restrictions as unnecessary and ineffective.\n\nFG, Afrexim Bank Intensify Talks on Local COVID-19 Vaccine Production\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next year, the Minister of Health, Ehanire, has said.\n\nEhanire disclosed at the weekend that the federal government had been meeting with the top officials of the Afrexim Bank to secure their financial support to fast-track the process of reviving vaccine production in Nigeria.\n\nPart of the readiness for local production of vaccines is the meeting of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\nDirector-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojishola Adeyeye, had stated that the country had met the 868 requirements demanded by the WHO to qualify for the production of vaccines in the country.\n\nHowever, Adeyeye added that WHO would still send an assessment team in a couple of months to verify things before formal certification would be given to Nigeria.\n\nEhanire noted in his speech at the special session of the National Council of Health that took place in Abuja, that one of the lessons, Nigeria had learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was the need to develop a minimum level of self-sufficiency in medical infrastructure.\n\nThe minister who was referring to the difficulties encountered by Nigeria in the procurement of basic treatment tools during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and is still experiencing it with regards to vaccine procurement, said: \u201cIt has been said that COVID-19 has been an eye-opener for the country. It has its realities, which we all have to adjust to. The first is that there is no way we can rest on our oars and believe that we have won. There is no way we can believe that nothing is happening. We all must agree to strengthen our health system and be prepared to tackle any of the health challenges.\n\n\u201cAt the time we were looking items like personal protective equipment, reagents, and other commodities, we realised that when push comes to shove, most of these countries would like to take care of themselves before considering even their friends and therefore we have realised that we need some level self-sufficiency\u201d.\n\nEhanire said that the federal government was pleased that in many ways the country is responding to the challenge and that industries have sprung up to produce personal protective equipment, hand sanitisers.\n\n\u201cOur research institutes have been able to develop equipment and materials. So, we are on a good way into that and our research Institutes have developed equipment and materials They have also been able to carry out sequencing and reagents and are on the way to making vaccines.\u201d\n\nHe said his ministry is working with the NCDC, Nigeria Medical Research, in Lagos, and the Centre for Excellence in Ede, Osun State, and trying to get the best from them.\n\nConcerning local vaccine production, Ehanire said the government was determined to achieve that.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited and I met with the Managing Director of the firm today and urged him to speed up all the processes for us to use the opportunities and support we have from outside this country to enhance the manufacture of vaccines.\n\n\u201cI also received the President of Afriexim Bank yesterday to discuss a few things. Part of it is the mopping up support in the area of vaccine production and when the details are clear we will be able to announce.\u201d\n\nEhanire said that the vaccine production is not just for COVID-19 but vaccines against various diseases, adding also that the country wants to be able to tackle future health emergencies as they emerge.\n\nThe minister said that part of what the government is trying to deal with is to clear the erroneous perception that the foreign partners said that Nigeria does not have anything on the ground.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a veterinary vaccine plant in Jos,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria once had a human vaccine factory, which was shut down for maintenance.\n\nThe minister promised that the government was working to revive the vaccine production facility.\n\nHe said that it requires technical expertise and funds to pull through with the venture.\n\nBut Tomori, who is also a former President of the Nigeria Academy of Science, (NAS), told THISDAY in a telephone interview at the weekend that the country may not be ready to produce the vaccine within one year.\n\nTomori said that Bio-Vaccine Company is already taking steps to speed up the process, pointing out, however, that to get the structures and equipment ready for commencement of local vaccine production would probably exceed the one-year target.\n\n\u201cBio-vaccine is already fast-tracking steps to produce vaccines locally. Even if the buildings and structures are ready today, you will need more than a year to begin vaccine manufacturing. And the buildings are not ready yet,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Opposition party shifts inauguration of Ayu, others to Friday\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is palpable tension within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the Supreme Court will tomorrow hear the appeal filed by the sacked National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, asking the apex court to quash his removal from office, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the apex court may also decide to rule on the matter tomorrow, or later within the week.\n\nIt was learnt that the fear that the decision of the Supreme Court may affect the recent National Convention of the party has led the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of the Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) from Thursday, December 9 to Friday, December 10.\n\nThe National Chairman-designate of the party, Ayu, and other members of the NWC were elected at the October 30 and 31 National Convention of the party after Secondus was removed from office.\n\nSecondus wants the Supreme Court to interpret the PDP constitution as it concerns the power of the party to sack a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC), particularly, the national chairman of the party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, it was gathered, will hear Secondus\u2019 petitions on Monday, December 6.\n\nSecondus had filed a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court asking it to declare that he is the only one who had the legal right to preside over the last national convention.\n\nHe is also seeking an order declaring that his suspension at the ward level was not enough reason for him to vacate the office of the national chairman of the party.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, some members of the party had instituted a suit marked: PHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division, with Secondus and the PDP as defendants.\n\nThe applicants had asked the court to stop Secondus from parading himself as the PDP chairman as he had been suspended at his ward.\n\nThe court subsequently restrained Secondus from performing the functions of the office of the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nSecondus, however, filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal, demanding that his suspension be declared illegal and the party be prevented from holding its October 30 and 31 conventions unless he was allowed to preside over the exercise.\n\nBut his appeal was thrown out and the appellate court gave the PDP the green light to hold its convention.\n\nAt the national convention, a former Senate President, Ayu, emerged as the chairman-designate of the party, and his inauguration along with other members of the NWC was initially fixed for December 9, 2021.\n\nHowever, Secondus is now praying for the Supreme Court to declare that the appellate court erred in its judgment.\n\nAccording to the appeal filed by his lawyer, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), there are three grounds for appeal.\n\nSecondus said Section 222(c) of the Nigerian Constitution requires every political party to have a constitution, which shall be registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to him, Article 35(1) (b) of the PDP\u2019s Constitution confers on the national chairman of the party the right to preside over the national convention, but the appellate court gave the party the right to hold the convention without him.\n\nThe embattled chairman also argued that the fact that he was suspended at his ward did not translate to him being suspended as the chairman of the PDP.\n\nHis notice of appeal to the apex court read in part: \u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law when it held that the appellant had no legal right or interest to protect by his application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law and violated the appellant\u2019s right to a fair hearing when it held that the appellant, having been suspended as a member of the 6th respondent (the PDP), could not continue to function as the national chairman.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law in dismissing the appellant\u2019s application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\u201d\n\nSecondus subsequently sought four reliefs, including an order allowing the appeal, an order setting aside the decision of the appellate court, and order confirming that Article 35(I) (b) of the PDP Constitution confers on him the personal right to preside over the convention of the party.\n\nIt is feared that if the Supreme Court grants Secondus\u2019 prayers, the election of Ayu and other members of the NWC, as well as all other actions taken by the party in his absence will become null and void.\n\nThis fear may have informed the decision of the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of Ayu and other members of the NWC from December 9 to December 10.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Governor of Adamawa State, Hon. Ahmad Fintiri, who was the Chairman, National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC), \u201cthe swearing-in of the newly elected National Officers of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), earlier scheduled for Thursday, December 9, 2021, has been rescheduled for Friday, December 10, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cAll party leaders, stakeholders, and members nationwide are advised to note this accordingly, please.\n\nFintiri\u2019s statement was titled: \u2018Change of Date for the Presentation of Certificate of Return and Swearing-in Ceremony of the Newly Elected PDP National Officers.\u2019\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Nine-month petrol subsidy payments gulp N1.027tn\n\n*FG vows to tackle cooking gas price hike\n\n*Says PIA will boost per capita consumption of the product\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited will again make a deduction of roughly N200 billion from the joint federal, state, and local government account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets later this month to share the statutory monthly allocation.\n\nAn analysis of the document by THISDAY, detailing the presentation of the national oil company to FAAC in November, indicated that the N200 billion will be the highest amount deducted by the NNPC since it resumed payment of petroleum subsidies in February this year.\n\nIn all, it further showed that the NNPC has netted off at least N1.027 trillion from monies accruing to the three tiers of government in the country between February and October as payment for the controversial petrol under-recovery.\n\nTo encourage the use of gas as domestic and vehicular fuels, the federal government has said it was leveraging the pricing framework and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support the use of gas among vulnerable Nigerians to tackle the price hike.\n\nWhile lamenting that the North-west zone of the country consumes only four per cent of the cooking gas consumed in the country, the federal government also stated that the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) of 2021 would increase the per capita consumption of gas in Nigeria.\n\nA breakdown of the various deductions indicated that payments have increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as a subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion.\n\nIn July, the document stated that N103.2 billion was spent on what the government terms under-recovery.\n\nAugust had the year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion.\n\nHowever, this will be overtaken by the N200 billion planned deduction later this month, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion.\n\nHowever, the overall crude oil lifting by the newly rechristened company almost doubled in September, according to the national oil company during the presentation which held on the 17th of November.\n\nIn addition, the presentation signed by Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, Umar Ajiya, noted that for October, the NNPC spent over N7.7 billion on its strategic holdings and fixing of its pipelines.\n\nBesides, the NNPC stated that product losses amounted to N143.3 billion, stressing that the \u201cvalue shortfall\u201d of nearly N200 billion would be subtracted later this month when the FAAC meeting holds.\n\nPart of the presentation obtained by THISDAY read: \u201cThe overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 11.49 Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in September 2021 recorded 98.5 per cent increase relative to the 5.79 Mbbls lifted in August 2021.\n\n\u201cDomestic gas and other receipts in the month was N6.78 billion. The domestic gas in the month was N4.07 billion. Feedstock valued at $59.43 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.57 million was received during the month.\n\nOn domestic crude and gas sales, it added: \u201cThe sum of N252,968,629,898.13 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe recoveries were: strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounting to N7,757,631,778.84, product losses worth N143,386,571.87, and value shortfall of N163,709,314,928.61. This comprised of the N123,709,314,928.61 for September 2021 and N40,000,000,000.00 value shortfall deferred in June 2021.\u201d\n\nFor November operations revenues which are due for sharing in November, the NNPC indicated that almost N200 billion will be netted off or removed as it had done in the previous months.\n\n\u201cThe October 2021 value shortfall of N199,007,758,422.75 is to be recovered from the November 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the December 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d it emphasised.\n\nOn its other receipts, the national oil company noted that the sum of $95.63 million being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees as well as interest income was received in October 2021.\n\nCompared to the previous month, the overall NNPC crude oil lifting was 5.79Mbbls in August 2021, a record of 33.5 per cent decrease relative to the 8.71Mbbls lifted in July 2021.\n\nThe NNPC said that Nigeria recorded 1.417 barrels per day million production in September 2021, just like it did in August 2021, adding that while crude oil export revenue received in September 2021 amounted to $8.38 million equivalent of N3.22 billion, for October \u201cthere was no crude export revenue\u201d.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally, so almost all the revenues are spent importing petrol and paying subsidies, even for neighbouring countries where the product is smuggled into.\n\nOn November 23, the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, projected that petrol would sell for between N320 and N340 per litre from February, next year.\n\nStressing that Nigeria would be out of the subsidy regime in the first quarter of 2022, Kyari explained that subsidy would have been eliminated this year, but for certain (unnamed) factors that prevented it.\n\nTo ameliorate the impact of the petrol subsidy, the federal government said it was planning to give N5,000 each to 40 million poor Nigerians.\n\nThis proposition has been rejected by many Nigerians who believe there\u2019s no sense in replacing a lesser subsidy with a much more burdensome one.\n\nIn addition, the labour unions have cautioned the federal government against unilateral removal or stoppage of the petrol subsidy regime, warning that removing it without meeting labour\u2019s demands will be met with stiff resistance.\n\n\u201cThere will be no provision for it (subsidy) legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit most subtly and easily,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nThe NNPC boss spoke during the presentation of the November edition of the World Bank Nigeria Development Update, titled: \u201cTime for Business Unusual.\u201d\n\nIn August, Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, speaking on behalf of his colleagues in reaction to the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) signed by President Muhammadu Buhari said he didn\u2019t believe in the credibility of the subsidy figures churned out by the NNPC.\n\nFG Vows to Tackle Cooking Gas Price Hike\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government said it was leveraging the pricing framework and the CBN\u2019s gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support the offtake of gas among vulnerable Nigerians to tackle inflation.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, disclosed this yesterday during the inauguration of a 100-metric tonne LPG (cooking gas) storage and bottling plant, constructed by Butane Energy Limited in Kabukawa, Katsina State.\n\nSylva, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr. Sani Gwarzo, explained that the pricing of LPG was a major threat to gas affordability and penetration in the country.\n\nHe said the declaration of Decade of Gas by President Muhammadu Buhari, was to reinforce Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to leverage on its gas resources estimated at 206 TCF to develop the country\u2019s national industrial, commercial and agricultural base.\n\nHe reiterated that the federal government had embarked on numerous gas-based initiatives such as the Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme, the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP), and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas Pipeline to accelerate economic development.\n\n\u201cI cannot conclude this speech without touching on gas pricing which is a major threat to gas affordability and gas penetration.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is leveraging on the gas pricing framework and the CBN gas development fund to create appropriate funding models to support offtake of gas especially among vulnerable groups\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe deliberate focus of this administration to develop the gas sector is largely the driving force behind NCDMB commercial intervention in partnering with the private sector, to establish Butane LPG bottling plant in several northern states including Katsina, Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi, Niger, and the FCT,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister averred that the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021 by President Buhari has reinforced the government\u2019s commitment to transform the oil and gas industry by creating an enabling environment for accelerated investment in exploration and field development projects.\n\nThis, he said, would pave the way for the integration of host communities into the benefit plans of the industry and entrenchment of local content as the driving philosophy for oil and gas transactions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the PIA and the intensive investment in gas transportation, storage, and marketing infrastructure will no doubt increase per capita consumption of gas in Nigeria which currently stands at 80 cubic meters per capita consumption despite our huge gas reserves\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, said despite the utilisation of 1,000,000 metric tonnes of LPG in 2020, Nigeria has one of the lowest per capita LPG consumption in Africa.\n\nHe affirmed that available data from the office of the National Gas Expansion Programme revealed that LPG utilisation in the North-west was four per cent compared to 14 per cent in the South-west and 15 per cent in the South-east.\n\n\u201cThat is why we chose to partner Butane Energy to increase the level of LPG utilisation in the North as they understand the market in the region, possess the technical capability and the determination to embark on such a venture,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of Butane Energy Limited, Mr. Isa Inuwa, said by September, the company would have five gas plants with a total storage capacity of 820 metric tonnes.\n\nHe noted that the five gas plants would be located in Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Bauchi, Niger, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) with the capacity to process 9,200 12.5kg of cylinders.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "* Investors commit N412bn to 35 Nigerian startups in 10 months\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared that Nigeria remains the most viable and attractive investment destination in Africa.\n\nBuhari also said Nigeria is on the path of becoming Africa\u2019s leading industrial and trading nation.\n\nThis is coming as some foreign and local investors have invested a total of N412billion ($992million) across 35 Nigerian startups in the first 10 months of 2021.\n\nThe president, who stated these in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) while addressing a trade and investment forum at Dubai Expo 2020, said Nigeria is reaping from the efforts his administration has made to consciously improve the investment environment.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria\u2019s pavilion at the Expo 2020 clearly shows why we remain the most viable and attractive investment destination in Africa. Our location, our natural resources, our population, and our regulations are there for all to see.\n\nNigeria is on its way to become a leading industrial and trading nation in Africa. To achieve this, our government focused on policies, projects and programs that support private sector investors.\n\n\u201cWe introduced numerous fiscal incentives and infrastructure projects aimed at enhancing the viability of investments.\n\n\u201cDespite the adverse global economic environment of recent years, Nigeria\u2019s investment environment has greatly improved both at the national and sub-national levels,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari assured captains of industry, and entrepreneurs, who have shown interest and commitment to further enhance trade and investment relations with Nigeria, that his administration would continue to work with them to improve the business climate especially as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) comes into full effect.\n\n\u201cJust last month at the Intra Africa Trade fair in Durban, I reminded business leaders that most of Africa\u2019s challenges, whether security, economic or corruption, can be traced to our inability to domesticate the production of our most basic requirements and provide jobs to our teeming and dynamic youth population.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that this Forum focuses on \u2018Unveiling Trade and Investment Opportunities in Nigeria,\u2019 and will encourage you all to keep an open mind and look beyond the challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this room, we have governors, ministers and heads of government agencies that can address all your questions and concerns.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are here to support you and I hope you will all take this opportunity to move your investment decisions forward,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also used the occasion to express profound gratitude to his hosts, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates and the Emir of Abu Dhabi, for their unwavering commitment to strengthen trade and investment relations between both countries through various initiatives, partnerships and support.\n\nInvestors Commit N412bn to 35 Nigerian Startups in 10months\n\nMeanwhile, some foreign and local investors have invested a combined sum of N412billion ($992million) across 35 Nigerian startups in the first 10 months of 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Google has pledged to invest $1billion in Africa over the next five years aimed at promoting digital transformation and innovation across the continent.\n\nThe Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), which disclosed this in its monthly economic report for December, described the rising interest in Nigerian startups as a good omen for the Nigerian economy.\n\nStartup traditionally refers to a company still in its early stages of operations.\n\nThe report noted that on its part, the federal government has developed the Nigerian Startup Bill, which is on its way to the Senate for approval, adding that if passed, the bill will empower the Nigerian tech ecosystem by fostering cooperation between stakeholders in the startup space and Nigerian regulators to ensure that subsequent laws and regulations are in line with the best interests of the sector.\n\nAccording to the report, the development is an indication that Nigeria, in recent years, has witnessed the advent of a new type of company, one more forward-looking and technologically savvy than those of the past.\n\n\u201cThese companies typically leverage technology to disrupt already established industries and offer a new standard of value to consumers,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt explained that these companies, apart from obviously creating employment opportunities, bring huge swaths of foreign capital and investments into the country. A number of them also help to solve burning societal and economic issues that impede the living standards of many Nigerians.\n\nFDC believed that \u201cThe copious amount of startup firms with decent value propositions, and the availability of a large market with active demand for their service offerings, coupled with the large in the flux of foreign capital, all illustrate the fact that we are at the genesis of the golden age of startups in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the global boom in startup popularity is not exclusive to Nigeria or the West, Africa currently has about 577 registered startup companies.\n\nNigeria is said to have accounted for the second-highest number of these at 144, just behind South Africa which has 154 startups.\n\nBy far the most popular startups in Africa are the tech startups, consisting of fintech, e-commerce, e-health, ed-tech, and agri-tech among others.\n\nIn 2020, African tech startups raised a combined sum of $701.41million; $625.66million (89.2 per cent) of that went to the \u2018big four\u2019 African technology investment destinations \u2013 Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt.\n\nThe FDC said that the number of Nigerian startups that secured investments in 2020 represented a 77 per cent increase from the number recorded in 2019, which was 48.\n\nIt added that the Nigerian startup funding has risen every year since 2016, with 2020 representing a 22.8 per cent increase from funding secured in 2019.\n\nThis trend is projected to continue as estimated funding secured in the third quarter of 2021 alone ($248million) surpassed the totality of funding secured in 2020 by 64.89 per cent.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, certain Nigerian startups distinguished themselves from the pack by raising prodigious amounts compared to the rest of the startup industry. For example, Flutterwave, a fintech company, raised $35million in its series B funding round. Flutterwave would later go on to raise $170million in its series C round in 2021, which would elevate the company to Unicorn status. Fintech company Bitfxt and e-health firm, 54gene secured $15million each in 2020,\u201d the report said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "FG refuses to restrict inbound travellers over Omicron, approves vaccine booster jabs\n\nPCR test now to be done 48hrs before departure\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nWith the global surge in COVID-19 and its new Omicron variant, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday emphasised the urgent need for world leaders to work together and reinforce partnerships to limit the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, during Nigeria\u2019s Day at Dubai Expo 2020, the President declared that the theme of the global event, \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the Future\u201d, had placed a moral burden on all relevant stakeholders, across national boundaries, to urgently work together for a better and brighter future, by stemming COVID-19.\n\nOn the same day, amid the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the global audience at Dubai Expo 2020, said: \u201cThe concerted efforts by world leaders, working together, enabled us to limit the catastrophic consequences of this pandemic.\n\n\u201cSuch level of continuing understanding and pragmatic partnership are needed and must be reinforced to ensure that our world is a better place that addresses humanity\u2019s common challenges to guarantee sustainable development and progress for the global community.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the distinguished audience that Nigeria, like other countries in the world, was impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding national efforts in addressing insecurity, fighting corruption and diversifying the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that the present administration in Nigeria had registered significant progress within a short period of time \u201cand is still making headways\u201d in key sectors of the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, the Nigerian delegation is participating in this Expo with great prospects for positive outcomes, while assuring the world of our determination and readiness to partner with relevant investors in our bid to tackle a number of challenges to make Nigeria a better country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is participating in this epoch-making event in order to explore opportunities that are capable of unlocking the huge potentials that abound in our country, as it makes conscious efforts to be a strategic partner of choice for the global community.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure, therefore, to invite all participating countries, organisations and other private sector operators to take full advantage of opportunities being provided by the EXPO 2020, by linking up with the Nigerian team, to collaborate with us in diverse areas of interests for our mutual benefits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for inviting him to the Expo and especially to attend Nigeria\u2019s Day event, which offers a great opportunity to show-case the potential of Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nHe described Dubai Expo 2020 as the single most important global event of its kind to take place in the Middle East, Africa and the South East Asian regions in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be a part of this dynamic evolution of pragmatic partnerships that are both creative and innovative for the progress of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nFG Refuses to Restrict Inbound Travellers over Omicron\n\nNotwithstanding the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government yesterday unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nOmicron, identified as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, was recently detected by South African scientists.\n\nThe National Incident Manager of the presidential task force on COVID-19, Mukhtar Muhammad, had last Monday announced that the government would release a new travel protocol to prevent the Omicron COVID-19 variant from entering Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) later announced on Wednesday that three cases of Omicron had been detected in the country.\n\nIn the new Nigerian travel protocol dated December 1 and signed by Boss Mustapha, Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, all in-bound passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure and post-arrival day two COVID-19 PCR test.\n\nAlso, all unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals are to observe self-isolation for seven days.\n\nIn addition, there will be day seven post-arrival exit PCR test for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals.\n\nAll out-bound passengers are also required to provide either a valid evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 or negative PCR test result within 48 hours from the time of boarding.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said the revised protocol \u201cis aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\u201d\n\nThe SGF added: \u201cThe review of the protocol is based on science, national experience, and global developments.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Payourse secures $600k pre-seed to accelerate crypto adoption across Africa",
          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology?

A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics.\n\nAn awareness campaign that the stigma attached to people living with AIDS can be just as deadly as the disease.\n\nIn a press statement by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the world \u201ccould face 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next ten years\u201d if inequalities are not addressed.\n\nToday\u2019s insight on AIDS is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here.\n\nOctamile raises $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctamile Founder, Gbenro Dara\n\nOctamile, an African insurtech startup, has closed a $500,000 pre-seed round to simplify access to insurance for Africans.\n\nThe funding round was led by EchoVC. Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team.

Ugwu sent a Direct Message to one of the co-founders on Twitter, Flori Ventures was introduced through a partner and so was Olumide Soyombo, Founder of Volton Capital.\n\nBut the early days of applying to accelerators and getting rejected \u2014 they applied to Y Combinator twice and got rejected both times \u2014 taught them an important lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was getting the meeting with the investors that was the problem. We realised that once we actually get a meeting with an investor and talk to them, they want to invest. The first day we had a call with Michael, he wanted to invest.\u201d The same story with Flori Ventures, Aminu says.\n\nThe journey into entrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Aminu, Anisere, and Hakeem Orewole co-founded Payourse, launching the company\u2019s first product, Coinprofile.\n\nAminu had dropped out of a five-year programme in the Federal University of Technology, Minna in 2017, but had caught the crypto bug before then.\n\n\u201cI found out about crypto from a friend and then I bought some and since then I became obsessed. Because it was interesting to me and I was someone who was really curious back in school, and II didn\u2019t really understand how it could be money and wanted to understand it. I kind of went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand how bitcoin and crypto works.\u201d\n\nThat same year, he met Orewole on an online crypto forum and the two became good friends. So good that both founded a crypto startup in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, it failed because, as Aminu laughingly says, \u201cI was very young then and didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d They went on to found another startup in 2018, but this one \u201cfailed even faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, Aminu decided the startup life was not for him and decided to take his chances in the labour market.\n\nDuring his undergraduate days, he had learnt graphic design and soon got a job with an Australian company where he learnt a little bit of product designing while in his role as a graphic designer.\n\nHe moved to Busha \u2014 where he met Anisere \u2014 and then to TeamApt, Yellow Card, Interswitch, and finally Binance.\n\nWhat is a Payourse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayourse\u2019s homepage\n\nOn Monday, November 22, 2021, Aminu announced on Twitter a new parent company, Payourse.\n\nToday, I'm excited to introduce our new parent brand.\n\n\n\nMeet Payourse @payourse. We're passionate about accelerating access to crypto for Africans by providing tools that make it easier, faster and cheaper for businesses to build user-friendly crypto products like @coinpHQ. \u2014 Bash \u6211\u521b\u9020 \u272a (@scozky) November 22, 2021\n\nBut as he tells Techpoint during our call, Payourse has been in existence since 2019, when they first founded Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cWell, we actually created Payourse, a long time ago, in 2019 as a parent company, but we never really announced it to the world. But it\u2019s always been the parent company. And we\u2019ve always had this long term vision of a company which would build user-friendly products on top of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to make crypto accessible to everyone, as Aminu strongly believes it is the future of finance in Africa.\n\nAfrica is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally with six countries \u2014 Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania \u2014 making it into the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20.\n\nThe Web3 \u2014 a decentralised version of the Internet built on public blockchains \u2014 craze has also been making waves, with increasing noise being made in crypto and blockchain spaces.\n\nHowever, apart from creating accessible products is the vision to be the crypto powerhouse, a go-to for any organisation looking to build or integrate Web3 or crypto products.\n\nPayourse currently has two major products, Coinprofile and Simpa.\n\nThe first iteration of Coinprofile was a Disha but for crypto wallets.\n\n\u201cI used to be an OTC (over-the-counter) trader, so anytime someone wants to send me crypto, and I always have to go to my wallet address and copy wallet address and send it to them. It was a very tedious process.\u201d\n\nFrom experience, he knew that other traders faced the same issues, so the idea was for people to create an account and store all their wallet addresses, and a unique link is created, leading to a landing page. This was where the name coinprofile came from. It doesn\u2019t require sign-ups, and there are no transaction charges.\n\nThe current remittance product came in May. Now, users can send cryptocurrency to anyone and receive it in cash in their bank accounts.\n\nThen there\u2019s Simpa, a no-code tool that enables businesses to create their own crypto exchange.\n\nThe numbers and the challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith free transfers, how does Payourse make money? Well, Aminu tells Techpoint that they earn an average of 1.5 \u2013 2% and sometimes even as much as 10% per transaction.\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile, with millions of dollars processed on the platform. Since its launch, the exchange has grown 15,000% across all touchpoints and maintained a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nAminu says Simpa is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version and is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks.\n\nBut building a company always comes with its challenges. And two of the biggest have been talent and marketing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced challenges in hiring. In fact, we\u2019ve had to let go of two of our employees. We had to hire them at that point because we hadn\u2019t raised a lot of funding, and we couldn\u2019t get a lot of really good people to apply for our roles.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they\u2019ve had to settle for junior to mid-level developers, with most senior developers opting to work for international companies.\n\nWith a team of eight and three technical founders, they\u2019ve had to rely on word of mouth and judging by their numbers, they might not be doing too badly, but Aminu tells us that an essential hire in the wake of this raise is hiring a Growth or Marketing person.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from hiring, Aminu outlines two critical things this fund would be used for: building out current products to package them for sales and making existing use cases better.\n\nIn a round that was oversubscribed up to $2 million, Aminu says there\u2019s no rush to get more funding.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe Payourse will be the powerhouse of crypto in Africa. When a business wants to develop crypto products for the African market or wants to integrate crypto into what they already have, we are the go-to.\n\n\u201cOur plan is not just to build infrastructure, but also build use cases around the infrastructure. We already have Coinprofile and Simpa. It might take a while, but we are not honestly looking to raise a $100 million very quickly. We want to, first of all, have a business and a clear path to revenue. The funding will come.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 has updated travel protocols for travellers as part of its efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\nFor passengers travelling out of Nigeria, travellers must perform a COVID-19 PCR test not more than 2days (48hours) before boarding and departure.\n\nPCR tests done more than 48 hours before departure are not valid and persons will not be allowed to board. Rapid antigen or antibody tests are not acceptable; only PCR tests can be used for this purpose.\n\nTest validity commences from the time of sample collection.\n\nFor Travelers with multiple connections before arrival in Nigeria, the PCR test must be valid within 48hours of boarding from the first point of departure.\n\nTravellers must bring along an electronic or hard copy of their negative COVID-19 PCR test for presentation at the departure airport and upon arrival in Nigeria. A record of their\n\nvaccination status will also be required on arrival in Nigeria.\n\nSecondly, all intending travellers (including diplomats and children less than 10 years old) must register via an online national travel portal (Nigeria International Travel Portal \u2013https://nitp.ncdc.gov.ng) and proceed to fill in the online Health Declaration/Self-Reporting form located on the portal.\n\nThird, after filling the online Health Declaration/Self-Reporting Form, travellers will be directed to upload their negative tests on the portal. Only children less than 10 years old are\n\nexempted from uploading a pre-arrival negative COVID-19 PCR test result. Once this is successfully done, travellers will proceed to the payment section of the travel portal. Only Children less than 10\n\nyears are exempted from payment for the repeat test in Nigeria.\n\nOnly children less than 10 years old are exempted from uploading a pre-arrival negative COVID-19 PCR test for presentation at the airport.\n\nFor partially vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers; on reaching the payment section of the portal, Travelers will be requested to select their preferred laboratory or sample collection centre based on where they will be self-isolating for the period of 7-days\n\nin Nigeria.\n\nRead also: Omicron variant: Canada adds Nigeria to travel ban list\n\nA list of accredited private laboratory providers or Sample Collection Centres across the country\n\nare available on the payment platform.\n\nThe next stage is to choose a bank payment gateway and then proceed to pay for Day 2 (arrival day + 1 day)and Day 7 (arrival day + 6 days)in-country COVID\n\n19 PCR tests. Travellers paying in Naira should use cards issued by a Nigerian bank.\n\nFor step five, following successful payment, travellers are to download the Permit to Travel Certificate or QR Code using the \u201cGet Permit to Travel\u201d button visible at the top right corner of the portal, save and print the form for presentation at the point of boarding.\n\nThe Permit to Travel Certificate or QR code will have a \u2018paid\u2019 label if payment is successful and an \u2018unpaid\u2019 label if the payment had not gone through yet or is unsuccessful.\n\nAny passenger with an \u2018unpaid\u2019 label will not be allowed to travel. A copy of the\n\nPermit to Travel Certificate/QR Code will also be sent to the email address provided by the traveller.\n\nPrior to boarding for Nigeria, travellers must present two documents at their point of departure to be allowed to board.\n\nAirlines have been directed not to board travellers with non-PCR COVID-19 tests (such as antigen or antibody tests), a positive Covid-19 PCR test result, or tests performed beyond 48hours of boarding.\n\nTravellers are also to present the permit to travel certificate or QR code generated from the Nigeria International Travel Portal on completion of a health questionnaire, uploading of a negative COVID-19 PCR result and schedule of PCR test on days 2 and 7 on arrival in Nigeria.\n\nTravellers failing to show a Permit to Travel Certificate or QR Code will not be allowed to board.\n\nOn arrival, all travellers are required to strictly adhere to instructions given by Port Health Services at the arrival\n\nterminal.\n\nTravellers who fail to adhere to instructions will be sanctioned by relevant security personnel.\n\nAll Travelers arriving in Nigeria will be required to go through the routine Port Health screening and present electronic or print-out evidence of pre-boarding COVID-19 PCR test, Permit to Travel Certificate or QR Code; and vaccination Certificate (where applicable); and present their international passports for clearance through the Nigerian Immigration Service System\u2019s Migrants Identification Data Analysis System (MIDAS).\n\nPartially vaccinated and unvaccinated in-bound travellers must proceed on mandatory 7days self-isolation/quarantine in their selected in-country destination address.\n\nTravellers are to avoid physical interaction with friends, family members, colleagues, and other members of the public during the period of self-isolation.\n\nThey must show up at the laboratory or sample collection centres on the 2 send a reminder text message, email, or phone call to the traveller a day before the samples will be taken, and a COVID-19 PCR test done. The selected private laboratory will send a reminder text message, email, or phone call to the traveller a day before the appointment date.\n\nPersons who test negative for COVID-19 after 7 days of self-isolation or quarantine will be allowed to exit self-isolation on receipt of their results.\n\nFully vaccinated in-bound travellers must show up at the laboratory or sample collection centres on the second day of arrival.\n\nSamples will be taken, and a COVID-19 PCR test done. The selected private laboratory will send a reminder text message, email, or phone call to the traveller a day before the appointment date.\n\nTravel to the UK\n\nThe UK on Saturday added Nigeria to its red list countries. This implies that only British and UK residents can travel, but they will have to be in a quarantined hotel for 10 days.",

          "title": "2023: Don\u2019t sit on the fence",
          "text": "Nigerians have been advised to get involved in the electoral process in 2023 and not to adopt the past lackadaisical attitude that has not helped the country.\n\nA number of politicians, analysts, groups and observers who spoke to our reporters and correspondents said that the next round of general election was critical to the survival of Nigeria as a country.\n\nFor some years now, it is usual to see many Nigerians fold their arms, saying it does not concern them whosoever wins a general election.\n\nOn the election day, many Nigerians prefer to sit in their cozy parlors watching the proceeding on the their television screens and making all manner of analyses.\n\nBut those who spoke with BusinessDay said if Nigeria must move forward, every hand must be on deck.\n\nIn a subtle sensitisation campaign recently, a concerned Nigerian posted on the social media a challenge to the educated members of the society who, despite their exposure have refused to take part in the electoral process.\n\nThe individual said: \u201cThe Almajiri has a PVC; Mai shayi has a PVC; Mai barrow has a PVC; Mai Debino has a PVC; Mai Gworo has a PVC; Gateman has a PVC; Onion & Tomato sellers have PVCs; Shoe shiner has a PVC; Sugar cane seller has a PVC; Bus Drivers/Conductors have PVC, and Motor park Agberos have PVC, but you (a student or a graduate with BSc or MSC holder) with all your education and exposure still don\u2019t have PVC.\n\nThe worst thing is that you even try to justify why you don\u2019t have one \u2018my vote won\u2019t count.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor the sake of those who paid your school fees and fed you through school, please don\u2019t make all your education/exposure useless with statements like that. If votes don\u2019t count, politicians won\u2019t bribe/pay people to vote them.Go and get your PVC!\u201d\n\nEnough-is-Enough (EiE) Nigeria, a non-for-profit organisation, in a recent release contained in its Newsletter, urged all Nigerians to arm themselves with their permanent voters\u2019 cards (PVCs), urging those yet to get theirs to make all necessary effort to do so.\n\nEiE Nigeria said: \u201cWe recorded a 22.13percent increase in Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in 2019. 2023 is now up to us! Remember that the final lap towards carrying out your civic duty as an electorate starts from getting your PVC so you can vote on election day.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Abuja, Ibrahim Shekarau said that the political future of Nigeria depended on the interest of the citizens.\n\nIn an interview with BusinessDay recently, the former governor of Kano State said: \u201cToday, people still don\u2019t have trust in government. And some of us in the political arena only see the people around in the name of party members. If you add all the 18 registered parties and all their members carrying their cards, they constitute a very insignificant percentage of Nigerians. So, why are we thinking only of patronage of party people? We must restore the confidence of the people. And this failure of confidence has led us to electing people that are not representative enough; all of us.\u201d\n\nThe serving senator and former Education minister, further said: \u201cOn INEC record, we have over 82million registered voters. But from 1989 to date, at no time have we had up to 40 million people voting. We end up electing a president with 15 million people. There is therefore, that apathy to election. When we are doing the voter registration, the religious leaders, the traditional leaders will mobilise voters, some will even say unless you show your voters card you won\u2019t go into the church; you won\u2019t go into the hospital; etc., all in an effort to mobilise people to get registered.\n\n\u201cBut what are we doing to encourage people to come out and vote? This is a challenge to the political parties, political leaders, to the electoral commission, civil societies, it\u2019s a challenge to the media. Let everybody pose and ask this question; where are 50 million people when the election comes? Only 30 or 35 million people will vote and yet it is real in a register of 80 million. It is real it is not fake. So, then what are we doing to bring out these people? And if all of these millions will come out, you\u2019ll discover that no elected government will take people for granted.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cRegarding thuggery and electoral malpractices, if in a polling unit you have 500 registered voters and all of them come to vote, no thug will dare come there to snatch a box. But when they realise that only some few people will come out, maybe 10, 20 or 30 to vote, this gives the polling clerk the opportunity to do some fraud. This gives the opportunity to the thugs to come and snatch the ballot box. So, one of the steps is not a creation of the tribunal for election offenders. The question is what do you do to even stop the offence? It is more important. If I say we are getting election malpractice because we are not prosecuting people, yes that is true but what are we doing to even stop those who attempt to do fraud? If a large number come out, then you find that nobody will dare engage in malpractice. For instance, 400 people come out, no young man will think of coming to foment trouble.\u201d\n\nRead Also: 2023 elections: Nigeria back to pre-1999 era\n\nNo democracy without voters\n\nOf all the various definitions of democracy globally, the most universally famous is the one that refers to it as the \u201cgovernment of the people by the people and for the people.\u201d\n\nSo, the meaning of the definition is that, it is the people that give impetus to democracy, and without people\u2019s participation such a system cannot be referred to as democracy.\n\nIn such a system, it is the people that determine, through their votes, who occupies public office. But in Nigeria in recent decades, the reverse has been the case; voter turnout for election has increasingly become abysmally low.\n\nAccording to the record from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the situation appears to have worsened in recent elections and has undermined the credibility of the election and the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\nIn Nigeria, voter apathy is a national trend that is perhaps, more worrisome in Southern Nigeria, irrespective of whether the election is a local or national election.\n\nFor instance, the recently concluded council election in Lagos State vividly captures the danger the trend poses to democratic processes in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, only 18percent of the total voters registered actually voted during the election. A Similar situation had existed in 2017 LG polls, which was also marred by voter apathy, with only 17 percent of the total registered voters voting.\n\nAlso, for the first time in history since the return to democracy in 1999, Nigeria recorded the lowest rate of voter turnout of 34.75 percent at the last presidential election held in 2019.\n\nThat figure of voter turnout in the 2019 election in Nigeria is said to be the lowest of all recent elections held on the African continent, according to the data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (I-IDEA).\n\nSimilar situation happened in the federal legislative by-election that was held in March this year in Aba North/Aba South federal constituency of Abia State, in which the election witnessed only 3percent turnout; it meant that only about 3 in 100 registered voters showed up to vote at that particular election.\n\nObservers say that the growing trend has serious implications on the prospect of deepening democracy in the country. In essence, it ensures that leaders who attain political power via the votes of the minority rule over the majority.\n\nAlthough stakeholders have deduced several reasons for the trend, however, pundits say that part of the reasons is the increasing loss of confidence of the Nigerian voters in the electoral process and the political elite running the affairs of the state because of decades of bad leadership.\n\nThey are of the view that this also indirectly affects voter behaviour which leads to voter apathy.\n\n\u201cThe current ruling elite have not really done much in changing the narrative because voters\u2019 confidence has continually gone down the drain since the government has failed to yield to its campaign promises.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that this may further affect voters\u2019 behaviour in future elections if the government or ruling elite do not rebuild public confidence in them and the electoral process,\u201d Kunle Okunade, political analyst said.\n\nOkunade added that the situation could likely change if elected public office holders become more responsive, fulfilling their campaign promises to the electorates, while stakeholders should embark on massive voter education.\n\n\u201cThey can do this through following the dictate of the Electoral Act to the letter and change in the leadership behaviour. The ruling elite need to change their leadership toga from public fund exploiters to public goods providers.\n\n\u201cWith this, voters would have belief and trust in the political elite and thereby change their political behaviour from apathy to participatory. INEC should also carry out voter education across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nTunde Daramola, a former national Secretary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, said years of bad governance and leadership failure was a major reason for voter apathy in Nigeria, adding that Nigerians had lost confidence in the electoral system.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPeople are not happy with the way things are done here; I mean Nigerians are hungry and you want them to vote. Governments have failed at all levels, the apathy is because of the belief that their votes would not count.\n\n\u201cPeople are refusing to vote because they are not happy with the system, so there must be a holistic change in the way we do things.\u201d\n\nHowever, political analyst, Kehinde kayode, said the problem is caused by several factors in the country that must be tackled for the trend to change.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cVoter apathy in Nigeria is tied to three important factors which include an increased uneducated population; second, a huge disconnect of the peoples\u2019 trust in the electoral process and government, and third, common scenario of electoral violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf all of the above factors are not addressed and reduced to the barest minimum possible, the case of voter apathy will forever linger on in Nigeria and continue to endanger our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe question we necessarily need to ask is to what extent we have as a country addressed these issues when we are putting out programmes or projects to address apathy?\u201d\n\nThe analyst also pointed out that \u201cWe must know that a solution to one of the factors causing voter apathy is dependent on the other. For Instance, even when we have an increase in the number of people who are educated, do we have a corresponding increase in ensuring the safety of voters during elections? And to what extent has the government- people trust improved with electoral result transparency?\u201d\n\nLike in 1993, free, fair poll still possible\n\nMany observers of Nigerian politics will easily agree that the June 12, 1993 general election was very successful and unarguably, the freest election in the history of Nigerian democracy.\n\nWell, credit goes to the electorate for the massive turnout, which even the international observers commended and acclaimed to be the highest in any election in Africa then.\n\nThe massive turnout was probably because Nigerians were tired of the long years of military rule and were out to unseat the junta through their votes.\n\nSadly today, subsequent elections have been having very poor turnout across the country, especially in the Southern part of the country.\n\nThe voter apathy is even alarming in the last two general elections won by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBut most political observers blame the apathy on the unfulfilled campaign promises of the politicians, hence, making voters doubt whatever is promised and even refusing to vote again.\n\n\u201cOur votes do not count,\u201d many aggrieved voters always lament.\n\nRecall that APC, the ruling party, which used \u2018Change\u2019 as its campaign slogan in 2015 when it was in opposition, asked Nigerians to vote for them as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the then ruling party, according to APC, has failed to fulfil its campaign promises.\n\nToday, many, even party members are more aggrieved as their party hardly fulfil the smallest campaign promise, observers noted.\n\nDecrying the growing lack of interest among voters, Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, said it is the expression of anger by the voters, who have discovered that their votes do not count, though it is the worst way to go about it.\n\n\u201cThough I am now based in Belgium, I still follow our politics. My father and many other aggrieved voters did not vote in the last general election because the candidates everybody wanted for the Senate and House of Representatives were rigged out during the primaries. For him, their votes will not count as the machinery that rigged the primaries will also rig the main election in the favour of the candidates who many distaste for their arrogance, ill-gotten wealth and intimidation of locals,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he regretted that such actions only made them disenfranchise themselves, giving the politicians opportunity to rig.\n\nAs bad as voter apathy is, Chijoke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, said that it is a reflection of realities for the voters, who always see their efforts on Election Day being fruitless with questionable election results.\n\nSpeaking from experience, the former Abia lawmaker said he has several witnessed imposition of candidates at ninth hour, resulting in the people sitting back, yet huge results were announced in such areas and the people wonder if spirits were the ones that voted as they did not come out.\n\n\u201cIn one of the elections in Ihechiowa in Arochukwu, a party bigwig and moneybag told the people that whether they vote or not that their party candidate is going to win the House of Representative. The people did not vote and the candidate won without votes\u201d, he said, lamenting that such situations make voters sit on the fence.\n\nBut sitting on the fence comes with a huge cost.\n\nThe lawyer-turned politician decried that voter apathy is the bane of poor governance as the informed voters sit at home and allow touts and those bought with mere N1000 to decide their collective future.\n\nGoing practical, Umelahi explained the risk of voter apathy saying, if three candidates are contesting for an electoral position and one is favoured by the people but does not have money, the people should support him at all cost to win because if the others use touts to get to power, they will continue with their touts, intimidation and no development.\n\nMaking reference with the advice given to Rivers youths by Chibuike Amaechi, minister of transportation, during one of the presidential campaigns in Rivers State, Magnus Okpeti, a Political Science lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, said that the former governor charged the youths to go for power as politicians will not relinquish power to them without fierce challenge.\n\nConsidering that advice, the aggrieved Ogoni-born Okpete said sitting at home on Election Day is giving up on oneself and change cannot come by doing the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe need to go beyond coming out in mass to vote, to defending our votes and sacking our tormentors. But voter apathy will not guarantee any change in voters\u2019 favour,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that many blame the growing voter apathy on rigging and especially intimidation by security operatives before and on the Election Day, but that such are expected and voters should know better and counter such intimidation with mass turnout.\n\n\u201cWe all saw what happened at the Anambra election recently. Before the election, there were killings, insecurity everywhere and fear that the people would not come out to vote, but some stakeholders went underground to tell the people that the only way to fight the enemies of the state and gain their common interest is to come out and vote. Things changed dramatically. People understood the game plan and countered it,\u201d Okpeti said.\n\nIn the same vein, Umelahi insisted that votes will count if people are determined to change the situation.\n\n\u201cThere is an extent you can rig or intimidate the people. With what is happening, the ruling party cannot win an election in the East and South South. So, the only option is rigging and intimidation, which the people are resisting fiercely now. If we say no to their policies or candidates, the ruling party and its government cannot kill all of us because this is democracy, it is only fear that is making people chicken out,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nFor Onikoyi, there is no need to fear again because the voters have not benefited from the dividends of democracy and if this gets into the consciousness of the voters, they will resist intimidations and turnout in mass to vote out the bad eggs.\n\nMaking emphasis on the need to turnout in mass to cast their votes, Onikoyi warned voters, saying, \u201cDo not fear that your votes will not count, vote first and defend your votes. June 12, 1993 general election is being lauded today because the voters are still insisting that their votes must count even after over two decades of its annulment.\u201d\n\nMy worries with Nigeria\u2019s brand of electorate \u2013 Sonaiya\n\nOluremi Sonaiya, a professor, panellist at AELEX law firm\u2019s webinar session titled \u2018The Nigeria We Want, Economic, Political, and Social Justice\u2019 on Wednesday, December 1, 2021, said: \u201cWe all know that \u2018stomach infrastructure\u2019 matters a lot, and people sell and purchase votes; you\u2019ll also hear things like, you know this guy is from my neighbourhood, or you know this person shares my religion during elections.\u201d\n\nNigerians may also choose a candidate based on the size of the party. The fact that the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) received the larger chunk of votes in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections resulted in the conclusion that voting for candidates from other parties may be a waste of time or may have little or no impact.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we are not making well-informed choices,\u201d Sonaiya admitted, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though we\u2019re the ones who put our necks in the loops and demand that they be tightened. Nigerians persuade themselves that they do not want to squander their votes by voting for someone who is unlikely to win.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that about 10 percent of the population is responsible for electing those who are in power. \u201cThat leaves us with 90 people to work with; imagine if they all resolved to do things differently; things would start to shift,\u201d she said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s first female presidential contender further said: \u201cI believe it is past time for us to genuinely begin to be analytical, to scrutinise people, and to begin to be rational in our election choices. Why do we keep voting for people who have clear records of either fraud or even a criminal past, and so on, when we know so much about them and their character? Are those the ideals we want to see in those who will lead us? As a result, these are critical challenges for us. We must be unbiased when it comes to ethnicity, religion, and other factors. We need people with character, we need people with competence, and those should begin to be the prerequisites that we consider before we make our choices.\u201d",
          "summary": "In an interview with BusinessDay recently, the former governor of Kano State said: \u201cToday, people still don\u2019t have trust in government.\nIn Nigeria, voter apathy is a national trend that is perhaps, more worrisome in Southern Nigeria, irrespective of whether the election is a local or national election.\nThey are of the view that this also indirectly affects voter behaviour which leads to voter apathy.\nThe voter apathy is even alarming in the last two general elections won by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nThe people did not vote and the candidate won without votes\u201d, he said, lamenting that such situations make voters sit on the fence.",

This decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant,\u201d British High Commissioner to Nigeria Catriona Laing said.\n\nThis is coming after Canada banned travellers from Nigeria, Egypt, and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new variant.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, on Friday confirmed the first 3 cases of Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\nThe Omicron variant also known as the B.1.1.529 lineage, was confirmed in travellers from South Africa who arrived in Nigeria on a day the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, arrived in the country on an official visit.\n\nAccording to Laing the UK will \u201ccontinue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the UK government also notified that the UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nCurrently, the majority of cases in the UK have clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria, and over the past week 21 reported Omicron cases in England originating from Nigeria, it said.\n\n\u201cA temporary travel ban will therefore be introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents who have been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they will be refused entry into the UK. This does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through Nigeria while changing flights.\u201d\n\nAccording to the notice, travellers from Nigeria are still able to transit to English airports, provided they have the necessary transit visa.\n\nFor more information about transiting through the UK from a red list country, the government recommended travellers to visit its website- www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-air-travel-guidance-for-passengers",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWARRI \u2013 As global outrage continues to trail the death of 12year old Sylvester Oromoni a Junior Secondary School 2 Student of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos State, who was allegedly tortured to death by senior students for refusing to join their cult group, the Governor of Delta State,Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on Saturday, said the \u201cmatter must be investigated, perpetrators apprehended, punished, and made an example of, to serve as a very strong deterrence against future occurrences.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, I spoke to Mr. Sylvester Oromoni, the father of late Sylvester Oromoni Jr., the Dowen College student, who unfortunately died under very controversial and unclear circumstances.\n\n\u201cDuring the call, I expressed my agreement with the decision of the Lagos State government to launch an investigation into the death of Sylvester, a native of Warri South Local Government Area in Delta State.\n\n\u201cAs a government that places priority on the lives of our citizens within and outside the state, we are determined to pursue this case to the end.\n\n\u201cThe matter must be investigated, perpetrators apprehended, punished and made an example of, to serve as a very strong deterrence against future occurrences. As we continue to watch this case closely, we extend our prayers and support to the Oromoni family.\n\n\u201cAs they mourn the loss of their young son, I pray that Almighty God gives them the strength that they need at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the umbrella body of Ijaw Youths worldwide, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) has joined in demanding for justice for the Ikaw born student.\n\nIn a statement signed by Comr. Ebilade Ekerefe National Spokesman, Ijaw Youth Council and made available to newsmen in Warri, the group said,\n\n\u201cWe watched with awe and shock the reported circumstances surrounding the death of a 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe have read to our chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe supposed injuries from the beatings led to his death, according to a Twitter user with the handle\n\n@perrisonoromoni, the boy\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the school\u2019s statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u201cLate Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbeh-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil. We are thankful to them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the\n\nschool management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by\n\ntrying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the Ijaw Youths worldwide wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester\n\nOromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe also call for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death. They have shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder. The fake story about the hip injury from a game of football shows in clear language that they are complicit in the crime!\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating license of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity showed by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commiserate with Sylvester Oromini Snr and the entire Ogbeh-Ijoh Royal family on this royal blood that has been spilled in a most dastardly manner.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria spent $1.41 billion on food importation from January to August 2021 despite the directive that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should stop issuing forex for food and fertiliser imports.\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari had in September 2020 given a directive to the CBN at a meeting of the National Food Security Council at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, saying that firms that were bent on importing food should source their forex elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNobody importing food should be given money,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement from the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.\n\nBut forex supply for food imports in the eight-month period rose by 35.28 per cent from $1.04bn in the same period last year, PUNCH reported.\n\nThe forex used for food products imports, however, rose from $163.6m in January 2021 to $197.73m in February but fell to $171.05m in March and $156.3m in April, according to the CBN data on sectoral utilisation for transactions valid for forex, the report said.\n\nThe amount of forex used for the importation of food products into the country surged to $213.58m in June from $135.76m in May.\n\nIt fell to $184.69m in July but rose again to $188.88m in August, the CBN data show.\n\nAmid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, forex supply for food imports fell by 9.22 per cent last year to $1.87bn from $2.06bn in 2019, accounting for about 6.57 per cent of the $28.46bn utilised for imports.\n\nThe COVID-19-induced slump in crude oil prices in 2020 hammered government finances and the naira, causing dollar shortages, with the external reserves falling to as low as $33.43bn on April 29, 2020.\n\nThe apex bank, in June 2015, excluded importers of 41 goods and services, including some food products, from accessing forex at the country\u2019s forex markets in a bid to conserve the external reserves as well as encourage local production of those items.\n\nFollowing the forex restriction, the amount of foreign currency used for imports in the country plunged to $24.72bn in 2015 from $34.20bn in 2014. It further fell to $17.15bn in 2016 and $15.16bn in 2017 but rose to $15.87bn last year.\n\nThe forex utilised for food imports also dropped to $3.42bn in 2015 from $5.03bn in 2014. It dipped further to $1.79bn in 2016 and $1.51bn in 2017 but increased to $2.31bn in 2018.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee said last month that between September and October 2021, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme, the CBN disbursed N43.19bn to support the cultivation of over 250,000 hectares of maize, sorghum, soya beans and rice during the 2021 dry season.\n\nIt said N5.88bn was disbursed to finance six large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme.\n\nThe MPC said, \u201cCumulatively, the bank has disbursed the total sum of N864bn to 4.1 million farmers, cultivating 5.02 million hectares. The bank also disbursed the sum of N41.2bn for the commencement of the brown revolution, a large-scale wheat program to wean us off imports by 35 per cent in the first year.\n\n\u201cThe continued security challenge across the country remained a major source of concern for Members, noting its impact on business confidence, foreign investment inflows and overall economic activities. The persistence of insecurity in major food-producing areas remained a key downside risk to the recovery.\u201d\n\nThe committee said with improved security, especially in the food-producing areas, food inflation would drop significantly following successful harvests and distribution, PUNCH reported.",

While in the process of that review additional information has come to light. Despite the termination, we will investigate as appropriate,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMr Cuomo, 51, said in a statement reported by the BBC that \u201cthis is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother,\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN\u2019s #1 show in the most competitive time slot.\u201d\n\nHe had worked for the network since 2013 and became one of its most recognisable news presenters, most recently leading CNN\u2019s coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nUntil last month, Mr Cuomo had reportedly enjoyed the support of CNN\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, and he faced no discipline for his behind-the-scenes strategizing with Andrew Cuomo\u2019s political aides, a breach of basic journalistic norms.\n\nIn a staff memo seen by the New York Times, Mr Zucker said: \u201cIt goes without saying that these decisions are not easy, and there are a lot of complex factors involved.\u201d\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe New York Times said the spectacle of a high-profile anchor advising his powerful politician brother amid scandal was a long-standing headache for many CNN journalists, who privately expressed discomfort at actions that, in their view, compromised the network\u2019s credibility.\n\nRenowned anchor of the Lead, Jake Tapper, went public with his concerns in May, telling The New York Times that his colleague had \u201cput us in a bad spot,\u201d adding, \u201cI cannot imagine a world in which anybody in journalism thinks that that was appropriate.\u201d Premium Times\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Nigeria has dropped from Africa\u2019s top 10 investment destinations to 14 as Egypt remains the number one nation.\n\nThis is according to a report by RMB titled, \u2018Where to Invest in Africa 2021.\u2019\n\nAccording to RMB, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, the ranking is based on countries operating environments.\n\nRMB Africa Economist, Daniel Kavishe, said the pandemic ushered a new world and a new approach to this year\u2019s list.\n\nKavishe said, \u201cWe created a new set of rankings that incorporated some of the unavoidable COVID-19-induced challenges, of which the operating environment score was one.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, fiscal scores are important indicators of how governments respond to COVID-19.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe inclusion of a fiscal score in our rankings aimed to score governments\u2019 fiscal positions and provided a basis from which investors can understand specific jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cAlthough the pandemic brought devastation, it also enabled opportunities for reimagining policies and trade relationships. Increasingly clear now is that home-grown strategies to tackle poverty, inequality and unemployment across Africa must be implemented. If not, all of Africa suffers.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, capital will flow naturally to economies offering a good mix of opportunity and ease of doing business.\n\nAccording to the company, the top 10 African countries to invest in are Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, Rwanda; Botswana, Ghana, Mauritius, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nThe company ranked Nigeria outside the top 10 at number 14.\n\nThe company said, \u201cThe sheer size of Nigeria\u2019s economy and large population base has undoubtedly aided the country\u2019s economic environment and has led to an increase in investments in the economy over the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe country boasts significant hydrocarbon resources and considerable agricultural and mining potential. With fiscal support expected to increase and continue over the next few years, given both the coronavirus shock and oil price collapse, the economy is expected to grow but at a slow and steady pace.\n\n\u201cOne of the key tenets for its development will be the efforts that have been made to support small and medium enterprises through monetary policy reform. This should support the country\u2019s efforts as it continues its expansion into sectors such as information technology.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company said Nigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil is impacting its economy.\n\nThe company said, \u201cNigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil means that the drop in oil prices and production generated by the OPEC+ agreement is strongly impacting the economy. COVID-19 came at a time when the economy was still rebalancing from the drop in oil prices during the 2014 to 2016 period.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a lower drop in reserves, tight liquidity and a weak currency can still be expected. The government, which has been criticised for its slow pace of reform, still faces a myriad of security challenges that destabilise the country, such as the activity of the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram in the northeast, forcing many people to flee.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Nigeria was ranked in the top 10 (eighth in both years).\n\nAlthough the company added that the nation\u2019s economy was constrained by a weak policy environment and dire infrastructure provision.\n\nAccording to the company, Nigeria was ranked 13 in 2017, and ranked number six in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, Nigeria ranked as number two and dropped to number five in 2015.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Although, no life was lost, sadly a minor sustained injury,\u201d the army said.\n\n\u201cGround troops in conjunction with the Air Component of OPHK responded swiftly and dominated the area with ground and air interdictions that successfully neutralized the threats and infiltration attempt by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe general public are urged not to panic as troops are on ground and aggressively dominating the city to effectively take out any perceived threat.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Maiduguri are equally enjoined to go about their normal socio economic activities and provide actionable information on the movement of these criminal elements.\u201d\n\nTerrorist attacks\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack comes a day after seven soldiers were reportedly killed by ISWAP jihadists near a base at Rann, close to the Cameroonian border.\n\nIn February, at least 17 people were killed and 43 others injured when ISWAP fighters fired multiple rockets on Maiduguri.\n\nThe terrorists have also blown up electricity towers on several occasions, plunging the city into darkness for months.\n\nOn February 23, 2019, a soldier was killed and 20 others wounded when Boko Haram launched 13 rocket attacks on Maiduguri hours before voting began in Nigeria\u2019s presidential election.\n\nOver 40,000 people have been killed since the Boko Haram insurgency began 12 years ago and more than two million are displaced from their homes.\n\nZulum reacts\n\nBorno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, visited the scene of the explosions on Saturday and sympathised with those affected.\n\n\u201cIt seems the insurgents came very close to the town, the military has to wake up and ensure adequate surveillance,\u201d Zulum said.\n\nThis is something that we can avert its occurrence. For the insurgents to have come such close to fire rockets, I think there is something wrong that we should have to check.\n\n\u201cWe have to fortify Maiduguri town, we have to ensure adequate patrols on a daily basis to avert future attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is very sad and unfortunate we have to witness this kind of attack at this time.\u201d",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit asking the court for \u201can order of perpetual injunction to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami from unlawfully shutting down telecommunication networks in any part of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1323/2021 filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja SERAP is asking the court to \u201cdetermine whether the shutdown of telecommunication networks in any part of Nigeria by the Buhari administration is unlawful, and a violation of the rights of access to correspondence, freedom of expression, information, and the press.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court to \u201cdetermine whether the shutdown of telecommunication networks in any part of the country is inconsistent with the principles of legality, proportionality and necessity, and the rights of access to correspondence, freedom of expression, information, and the press.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NCC Qualifies Three Telecoms For 5G Auction\n\nThe suit, which has been assigned to Honourable Justice Ahmed Mohammed at Court 4, is fixed for hearing on 11th January, 2022.\n\nJoined in the suit as Defendant is the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cLarge-scale shutdowns of communication networks are a form of collective punishment. Shutdowns exert significant chilling effects, with direct implications on participatory democracy, whose existence depends upon an active and informed citizenry capable of engaging with a range of ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has constitutional and international legal obligations to enable access to the Internet for all, as access to the Internet is inextricably linked to the exercise of freedom of expression and information.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cAccess to information, the ability to exercise the right to freedom of expression and the participation that internet and telecommunication networks provide to all sectors of society is essential for a truly democratic society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression and information may be restricted only in specific circumstances. Restrictions on these rights must be provided by law, proportionate, and necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others or for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health and morals,\u201d SERAP said.\n\nThe organization is also arguing that, \u201cWhile the authorities have a legal responsibility to protect, ensure and secure the rights to life and property, any such responsibility ought to be discharged in conformity with constitutional and international human rights standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of internet and telecommunication networks in Zamfara and Katsina states is particularly egregious, and suggests a disturbing trend, especially given the escalating repression and restriction of civic space in Nigeria. Shutdowns should never become an entrenched practice in the country,\u201d SERAP further stated.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cInternet and telecommunication shutdowns amount to inherently disproportionate interference with the rights to freedom of expression and information. Necessity requires a showing that shutdowns would achieve their stated purpose, which in fact they often jeopardize.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn their 2011 Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet, four special mandates on freedom of expression emphasised that \u2018Cutting off access to the Internet, or parts of the Internet, for whole populations or segments of the public can never be justified, including on public order or national security grounds.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights has affirmed the principle of non-interference with access to internet and telecommunication networks and stressed that States including Nigeria \u2018shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn June 2016, the UN Human Rights Council condemned \u2018measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law.\u2019 The Council called on all States, including Nigeria, to refrain from and cease such measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression and access to information are protected by Section 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights both of which Nigeria has ratified.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese rights must be protected online as they are protected offline. Access to the Internet is a fundamental right. Access to the internet is also a necessary precondition for the exercise and enjoyment of other human rights online and offline.\u201d\n\n\u201cShutdowns generate a wide variety of harms to human rights, economic activity, public safety, and emergency services that outweigh the purported benefits. Any shutdown has the potential to affect millions of internet and telecommunication users, and those on the margins of society are most impacted by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of the internet and telecommunication networks in Zamfara and Katsina states, without any legal justification, is inconsistent with the principles of necessity and proportionality. The suspension is a form of collective punishment of Nigerians resident in these states.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe imposition of any restrictions should be guided by the objective of facilitating the right, rather than seeking unnecessary and disproportionate limitations on it. Restrictions must not be discriminatory, impair the essence of the right, or be aimed at causing a chilling effect. Internet and telecommunication shutdowns fail to meet all of these conditions.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that the NCC recently ordered telecom operators to suspend all telecommunications networks in some states, including Zamfara State, and at least 13 local government areas of Katsina State purportedly to check \u201cbanditry\u201d/terrorism.",
          "summary": "Joined in the suit as Defendant is the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cLarge-scale shutdowns of communication networks are a form of collective punishment.\nShutdowns should never become an entrenched practice in the country,\u201d SERAP further stated.\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cInternet and telecommunication shutdowns amount to inherently disproportionate interference with the rights to freedom of expression and information.\nRestrictions must not be discriminatory, impair the essence of the right, or be aimed at causing a chilling effect.",

          "text": "Despite the popular clamour for the presidency to shift to the southern part of the country, there are strong indications that the two other zones in the north may as well pick their presidential candidates.\n\nThe 17 southern governors had called for the presidency to shift to the South in 2023.\n\nSome progressive northern governors such as Prof. Babagana Zulum of Borno State, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Bello Masari of Katsina State, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, and a host of others had thrown their weights behind the clamour for power shift to the South.\n\nHowever, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also yesterday adopted former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki as its presidential candidate.\n\nSix other states in the North-central had earlier adopted Saraki as their preferred candidate.\n\nThe Governor of Benue State, Ortom had variously said that the PDP would choose its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election by consensus like it did in the election of its National Working Committee (NWC) members during its National Convention.\n\nPDP leaders and stakeholders in Gombe State had last week adopted former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as their preferred candidate for the zone during the North-east business community summit.\n\nEarlier on as part of his consultations, Atiku was in Bauchi State where he commissioned some projects executed by the state government and thereafter, continued his consultations on his presidential aspirations\n\nFor Saraki, chieftains and stakeholders of the PDP in the North-central zone have resolved to support him as their consensus aspirant for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nLeader of the Movement for North-central Presidency, Prof. Yorwuese Hagher, gave the hint while speaking to journalists in Lafia, Nasarawa State capital.\n\nHagher, a former Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Canada who described North-central zone as the bleeding wound on the conscience of Nigeria, said it was time for the zone to lead the country.\n\nAccording to Hagher, the zone has been a cord which holds the country together in difficult times since independence, and has been supporting other zones to produce presidents.\n\n\u201cOut of the country\u2019s six geo-political zones, three have produced presidents \u2013 the Northwest, the Southwest and the South-South, the North-Central, the North-east and the South-east are yet to produce presidents.\n\nFor the governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, his aspiration has received a boost in the North-west.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the party may go for a consensus presidential candidate as it did in the election of Ayu as the national chairman but where there is no consensus among the aspirants, they may go for elective convention.\n\nSo far, former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim and Sam Ohuabunwa have officially indicated interest to contest for the presidential ticket of the PDP from the South-east.\n\nMeanwhile, like other states in the North-central zone, the FCT PDP yesterday adopted Saraki as its presidential candidate\n\nThe FCT Chapter of the PDP also adopted a motion that the North-central geopolitical zone should produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nWith yesterday\u2019s adoption of Saraki as the consensus presidential candidate, it means that all the six states in the North-central, and the FCT have adopted the former senate president as their presidential candidate.\n\nThe motion for the adoption of Saraki was moved by Alhaji Ogah Dona with the chairman of the FCT Chairman of the PDP, Sunday Zakka seconding the motion.\n\nWhen it was put to vote, the decision to adopt Saraki was unanimously carried.\n\nAt the event were: PDP stalwarts, including FCT chairman of the party, Sunday Zakka; Senator Sulaiman Adokwe; Dr. Musa Ahmadu, among others.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "text": "There is palpable tension within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the Supreme Court will tomorrow hear the appeal filed by the sacked National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, asking the apex court to quash his removal from office, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the apex court may also decide to rule on the matter tomorrow, or later within the week.\n\nIt was learnt that the fear that the decision of the Supreme Court may affect the recent National Convention of the party has led the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of the Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) from Thursday, December 9 to Friday, December 10.\n\nThe National Chairman-designate of the party, Ayu, and other members of the NWC were elected at the October 30 and 31 National Convention of the party after Secondus was removed from office.\n\nSecondus wants the Supreme Court to interpret the PDP constitution as it concerns the power of the party to sack a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC), particularly, the national chairman of the party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, it was gathered, will hear Secondus\u2019 petitions on Monday, December 6.\n\nSecondus had filed a notice of appeal before the Supreme Court asking it to declare that he is the only one who had the legal right to preside over the last national convention.\n\nHe is also seeking an order declaring that his suspension at the ward level was not enough reason for him to vacate the office of the national chairman of the party.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, some members of the party had instituted a suit marked: PHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division, with Secondus and the PDP as defendants.\n\nThe applicants had asked the court to stop Secondus from parading himself as the PDP chairman as he had been suspended at his ward.\n\nThe court subsequently restrained Secondus from performing the functions of the office of the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nSecondus, however, filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal, demanding that his suspension be declared illegal and the party be prevented from holding its October 30 and 31 conventions unless he was allowed to preside over the exercise.\n\nBut his appeal was thrown out and the appellate court gave the PDP the green light to hold its convention.\n\nAt the national convention, a former Senate President, Ayu, emerged as the chairman-designate of the party, and his inauguration along with other members of the NWC was initially fixed for December 9, 2021.\n\nHowever, Secondus is now praying for the Supreme Court to declare that the appellate court erred in its judgment.\n\nAccording to the appeal filed by his lawyer, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), there are three grounds for appeal.\n\nSecondus said Section 222(c) of the Nigerian Constitution requires every political party to have a constitution, which shall be registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to him, Article 35(1) (b) of the PDP\u2019s Constitution confers on the national chairman of the party the right to preside over the national convention, but the appellate court gave the party the right to hold the convention without him.\n\nThe embattled chairman also argued that the fact that he was suspended at his ward did not translate to him being suspended as the chairman of the PDP.\n\nHis notice of appeal to the apex court read in part: \u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law when it held that the appellant had no legal right or interest to protect by his application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law and violated the appellant\u2019s right to a fair hearing when it held that the appellant, having been suspended as a member of the 6th respondent (the PDP), could not continue to function as the national chairman.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal erred in law in dismissing the appellant\u2019s application, which was filed on October 14, 2021, and re-filed on October 27, 2021.\u201d\n\nSecondus subsequently sought four reliefs, including an order allowing the appeal, an order setting aside the decision of the appellate court, and order confirming that Article 35(I) (b) of the PDP Constitution confers on him the personal right to preside over the convention of the party.\n\nIt is feared that if the Supreme Court grants Secondus\u2019 prayers, the election of Ayu and other members of the NWC, as well as all other actions taken by the party in his absence will become null and void.\n\nThis fear may have informed the decision of the main opposition party to hurriedly shift the date of the swearing-in of Ayu and other members of the NWC from December 9 to December 10.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Governor of Adamawa State, Hon. Ahmad Fintiri, who was the Chairman, National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC), \u201cthe swearing-in of the newly elected National Officers of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), earlier scheduled for Thursday, December 9, 2021, has been rescheduled for Friday, December 10, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cAll party leaders, stakeholders, and members nationwide are advised to note this accordingly, please.\n\nFintiri\u2019s statement was titled: \u2018Change of Date for the Presentation of Certificate of Return and Swearing-in Ceremony of the Newly Elected PDP National Officers.\u2019\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "title": "UK to Add Nigeria to Red List on Monday Amid Omicron Spread",
          "text": "Following the 21 cases of Omicron variant of COVID-19 reported in England, which are linked to travel from Nigeria, the United Kingdom has announced a temporary measure to prevent further cases of the virus from entering the country from 4a.m. tomorrow Monday.\n\nUnder the new measure, which would be reviewed after three weeks, the UK will tomorrow add Nigeria to the red list of countries from where people arriving must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron strain of COVID-19, Health Secretary, Mr. Sajid Javid, said yesterday.\n\nThis implies that from 4a.m. on Monday, UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nA temporary travel ban would therefore be introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents who have been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they will be refused entry into the UK.\n\nThis does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through Nigeria while changing flights.\n\nCanada had on Tuesday banned travellers from Egypt, Nigeria and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron variant.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has, however, intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next one year, according to the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire.\n\nHowever, a renowned Virologist and Chairman of the Board of the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited, Prof. Oyewale Tomori, has told THISDAY that the local production of the COVID-19 vaccine in the country may not be possible within the next one year despite the ongoing efforts to fast-track the process.\n\nSpeaking on the UK\u2019s decision, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing said:\u201cI know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year. This decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work.\u201d\n\nUK Health Secretary, Javid also stated that travellers heading to the UK would now have to take a COVID-19 test before their departure in an effort to limit spread of the virus.\n\nHe said the tightened requirements would come into force from Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, travellers would be required to submit evidence of a negative lateral flow or PCR test to enter the UK.\n\nJavid confirmed that Nigeria would be added to the red list of countries from where people arriving the UK must quarantine in a hotel for 10 days.\n\nBBC reported that currently travellers only need to self-isolate until they test negative within two days of arriving the UK.\n\nJavid said the government\u2019s strategy since the discovery of the Omnicron variant had been to \u201cbuy time\u201d to assess and to \u201cput in place protective measures\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve always said that we would act swiftly should new data require it\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver the recent days we have learnt of a significant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria\n\n\u201cThere are 27 cases already in England and that\u2019s growing and Nigeria now is second only to South Africa in terms of linked cases to Omicron.\n\n\u201cSo today, the government has decided to add Nigeria to the travel red list and that will be effective from 4am on Monday. This will mean that only UK residents or citizens of the UK can enter the UK from Nigeria from that point onwards, and they would have to quarantine in one of the relevant hotels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also decided to require pre-departure tests for all inward travellers that will be effective from 4am on Tuesday, and they\u2019ll be required maximum of 48 hours before the departure time,\u201d he explained.\n\nUK said the new protocol does not apply to persons \u201cstaying airside and only transiting through\u201d.\n\nJavid added the government had \u201cbeen clear that we will take action if it is necessary,\u201d adding that it was important to remember vaccinations \u201care our first line of defence\u201d and calling on people to get a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine when called to do so by the NHS.\n\nThe moves come after pressure on the government to tighten the policy had been growing over the course of the week.\n\nLast week the government\u2019s scientific advisory body Sage, said pre-departure tests for those arriving in the UK would be valuable, in the leaked minutes of a meeting seen by the BBC.\n\nThe Labour Party had previously criticised the government\u2019s current testing policy and called for the reintroduction of pre-departure tests.\n\nWhile Labour has pushed for pre-departure testing to avoid Omicron spreading, travel businesses will see it as a significant setback \u2013 just when green shoots of recovery were emerging.\n\nAirlines have supported the red list re-introduction and extension.\n\nBut they view the introduction of blanket restrictions as unnecessary and ineffective.\n\nFG, Afrexim Bank Intensify Talks on Local COVID-19 Vaccine Production\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has intensified talks with Afrexim Bank to fast-track local production of COVID-19 vaccine within the next year, the Minister of Health, Ehanire, has said.\n\nEhanire disclosed at the weekend that the federal government had been meeting with the top officials of the Afrexim Bank to secure their financial support to fast-track the process of reviving vaccine production in Nigeria.\n\nPart of the readiness for local production of vaccines is the meeting of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\nDirector-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojishola Adeyeye, had stated that the country had met the 868 requirements demanded by the WHO to qualify for the production of vaccines in the country.\n\nHowever, Adeyeye added that WHO would still send an assessment team in a couple of months to verify things before formal certification would be given to Nigeria.\n\nEhanire noted in his speech at the special session of the National Council of Health that took place in Abuja, that one of the lessons, Nigeria had learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was the need to develop a minimum level of self-sufficiency in medical infrastructure.\n\nThe minister who was referring to the difficulties encountered by Nigeria in the procurement of basic treatment tools during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and is still experiencing it with regards to vaccine procurement, said: \u201cIt has been said that COVID-19 has been an eye-opener for the country. It has its realities, which we all have to adjust to. The first is that there is no way we can rest on our oars and believe that we have won. There is no way we can believe that nothing is happening. We all must agree to strengthen our health system and be prepared to tackle any of the health challenges.\n\n\u201cAt the time we were looking items like personal protective equipment, reagents, and other commodities, we realised that when push comes to shove, most of these countries would like to take care of themselves before considering even their friends and therefore we have realised that we need some level self-sufficiency\u201d.\n\nEhanire said that the federal government was pleased that in many ways the country is responding to the challenge and that industries have sprung up to produce personal protective equipment, hand sanitisers.\n\n\u201cOur research institutes have been able to develop equipment and materials. So, we are on a good way into that and our research Institutes have developed equipment and materials They have also been able to carry out sequencing and reagents and are on the way to making vaccines.\u201d\n\nHe said his ministry is working with the NCDC, Nigeria Medical Research, in Lagos, and the Centre for Excellence in Ede, Osun State, and trying to get the best from them.\n\nConcerning local vaccine production, Ehanire said the government was determined to achieve that.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited and I met with the Managing Director of the firm today and urged him to speed up all the processes for us to use the opportunities and support we have from outside this country to enhance the manufacture of vaccines.\n\n\u201cI also received the President of Afriexim Bank yesterday to discuss a few things. Part of it is the mopping up support in the area of vaccine production and when the details are clear we will be able to announce.\u201d\n\nEhanire said that the vaccine production is not just for COVID-19 but vaccines against various diseases, adding also that the country wants to be able to tackle future health emergencies as they emerge.\n\nThe minister said that part of what the government is trying to deal with is to clear the erroneous perception that the foreign partners said that Nigeria does not have anything on the ground.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a veterinary vaccine plant in Jos,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria once had a human vaccine factory, which was shut down for maintenance.\n\nThe minister promised that the government was working to revive the vaccine production facility.\n\nHe said that it requires technical expertise and funds to pull through with the venture.\n\nBut Tomori, who is also a former President of the Nigeria Academy of Science, (NAS), told THISDAY in a telephone interview at the weekend that the country may not be ready to produce the vaccine within one year.\n\nTomori said that Bio-Vaccine Company is already taking steps to speed up the process, pointing out, however, that to get the structures and equipment ready for commencement of local vaccine production would probably exceed the one-year target.\n\n\u201cBio-vaccine is already fast-tracking steps to produce vaccines locally. Even if the buildings and structures are ready today, you will need more than a year to begin vaccine manufacturing. And the buildings are not ready yet,\u201d he said.",
