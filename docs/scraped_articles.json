          "text": "The World Health Organisation has said Nigeria and four other countries rely heavily on external aids in matters concerning health expenditures globally.\n\nThis is as the global health body added that over half of Nigeria\u2019s spending on immunisation were funded by external donors.\n\nThe WHO, in its 2021 report on global expenditure on health which covered the past two decades, said global spending on health doubled in real terms.\n\nIt said, \u201cGlobal spending on health more than doubled in real terms over the past two decades, reaching $8.5trn in 2019 or 9.8 percent of global GDP but it was unequally distributed with high income countries accounting for approximately 80 percent.\n\n\u201cHealth spending in low-income countries was financed primarily by out-of-pocket spending. External aid rose considerably over the past two decades in countries that are highly dependent on external aids as the government\u2019s share of spending on health for domestic public sources fell in line with increased aid.\u201d\n\nFor countries highly dependent on external aid, the global body listed Nigeria.\n\nIt further explained, \u201cThe top five recipients of external health\n\naid in 2019 were Nigeria, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique, three of which are middle income countries.\n\n\u201cNigeria was the largest recipient, with health aid totalling $1.1bn, or 6.5% of global external health aid.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, low-income countries relied more heavily on external aid to fund spending on immunisation.\n\n\u201cLower-middle income countries varied widely on how immunisation was funded. Nigeria and India were\n\noutliers among countries with data: over half their spending on immunization was funded by private sources.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

That has not been done for the past 15 years, we appreciate the fact that the President and indeed the entire executive are determined to conduct the population census and we are all on the same page with the executive arm of government and we believe that it is something that will be beneficial to this country.\n\n\u201cSo it was on this note that we decided as a committee that we should listen, discuss with NPC to hear if there is any problem in terms of their funding.

He went and stole somebody\u2019s tank, the case is with the police. He uses dud cheque to deceive people. Instead of going to the police to answer his case, he is saying that i am chasing him, if I chase him will he stand?

I just loved the grandeur with which he carried himself at that age of about 70.\n\n\u201cAfter the pleasantries, he related how badly his party was received by Ila people in the First Republic and that Orangun Adetona Ayeni, Ariwajoye the First, was then the local leader of the AG.\n\n\u201cHe explained how he had been dodging all invitations to Ila to celebrate anniversaries of Adetona\u2019s coronation to avoid another public resentment by association.\n\nRead Also: APC miracle would have been difficult without Tinubu, says Akande\n\n\u201cI was flattered, humbled and shaken when he asked if I could accept to be his friend through whom he would then visit Ila again.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Yes!\u2019 Perhaps intuitively, I had prepared for this moment and would not let it pass without achieving my objective.\n\n\u201cI calmly brought out my note and with every decorum, announced that I had some questions.\n\n\u201cHe suggested, after my first question, that I should first ask all the questions together because he thought the answer to one might be applicable to some others.\n\n\u201cAt that point, Awolowo\u2019s equally legendary wife, Mama, Chief (Mrs) H.I.D Awolowo, peeped in and whispered to him.\n\n\u201cHe nodded back and told her to my hearing that he would prefer not to be disturbed until he was done with my audience.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWe discussed for well over two hours. In the end, I was totally satisfied in my mind that Awolowo was the leader of leaders.\n\n\u201cWithin my simple assessment, I was marvelled by his intellectual capacity and his presence of mind about names, dates and historical events.\n\n\u201cI was bowled by his sense of humour and truly mesmerised by his fatherly gesticulations in explaining difficult issues.\n\n\u201cI loved him more when I and my colleagues had to take our leave that evening.\n\n\u201cIn my assessment since that encounter, Awolowo can be rated indeed, as one of the greatest intellectuals in the politics of his time.\n\n\u201cNow that I had been admitted into the sanctum of the Awoist Movement, I felt energised and empowered.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I quickly and anxiously reported our meeting with Awolowo to the Ila Union in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe, in the union, agreed in principle, to prefer Awolowo\u2019s politics to any other.\n\n\u201cShortly after our visit to him, Chief Awolowo, accompanied by Chief Fasanmi, Chief Michael Omisade and Chief S.M. Afolabi visited Ila Orangun to hold a private meeting with our elders.\n\n\u201cAwolowo had earlier sent Omisade to me with the itinerary of his tour to our division just a week earlier.\n\n\u201cChief Omisade, a lawyer, was among those jailed with Awolowo during the Treasonable Felony case of 1963.\n\n\u201cHe was used by Ife elders as an independent candidate to defeat Fani Kayode of the Action Group to become a member of the House of Representatives in 1959 when Ila was part of Ife Division. He hailed from Ile-Ife.\u201d\n\nAkande, after the meeting, organised the visit of Awolowo to Ila-Orangun.\n\n\u201cI carefully selected and arranged the audience for the Ila meeting. Among those I selected were a group of men, led by Tijani Ologundudu, that remained influential for having participated and been jailed in the Hunters Riot of 1944.\n\n\u201cThey were the Muslim Youths in my father\u2019s time known as Kewulere. I also invited the cream of Ila local politics, those who controlled our grassroots.\n\n\u201cThey were impressed with the coming of Chief Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIn their presence, Chief Awolowo invited me to the immediate next meeting of the Committee of Friends.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting of the Committee of Friends, I first saw Chief Awolowo in action among some intellectual giants like Professor Sam Aluko, Professor David Oke, Professor Banji Akintoye, Chief Ayo Fasanmi, Chief Bola Ige, Chief Omisade, Chief Phillip Umeadi, Chief Wumi Adegbonmire and others. I respected him the more.\n\n\u201cAwolowo\u2019s coming to Ila brought me into the emerging trend of politics in Oyo State and the consequential role I was destined to play in it.\n\n\u201cI was still involved in the intrigues at the Constituent Assembly, but my heart was now on the future of Oyo State and our burning desire to get Awolowo elected as the President of Nigeria.\u201d",

Not so, this contribution from the Wise One of Ila-Orangun.\n\n\u201cIf there is any sizzling, it is simply the fire of truth\u2019s passion that leaps at the reader from between the covers. Akande\u2019s fire prurifies, being a flame of illumination carried over from real life to brighten the pages of saga of service to Nigerian humanity.\u201d\n\nAside Soyinka, Ambassador Dapo Fafowora also observed that the revelations in the scripts might provoke litigations.\n\n\u201cHe quickly constituted a committee of our children: Oluwafemi Akande, Esq., Oyewole Akande, Esq, and Ayobamidele Akande, Esq who are lawyers to have a second look at my presentation of facts,\u201d Akande wrote in the preface.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmong many revelations, Akande claimed that the nonagenarian Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s Lekki home was built for him by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He also said President Muhammadu Buhari reneged on his promise to make Tinubu his running mate in 2015.\n\nHe also had harsh words for former President Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Deputy Governor Iyiola Omisore. He added that N-PDP members snatched the leadership of the National Assembly in 2015.\n\nThe author also revealed how former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was nearly stopped from joining the then fledging APC by his former colleagues in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had decided to team up with the new party in 2012 ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\n\u201cWhen the party (APC) was ready and we were going around to all the leaders, someone reminded us that we had not seen Obasanjo and Babangida and asked them to join us.\n\n\u201cWe also decided to extend the same courtesy to Atiku Abubakar, being a former vice president. But we were a bit reluctant about Atiku because he was being avoided by the new-PDP.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we decided to meet him. The team met him in Abuja. He did not make any demand on us. He participated actively in all the congresses and tried to help the APC grow in his area.\n\n\u201cWe wooed all the leaders of the new-PDP and visited all of them. They told us they needed to hold a meeting and take a decision.\n\n\u201cNyako of Adamawa told us at a stage that he would leave them behind and join us on his own.\n\n\u201cSome of them felt they were being stampeded.\n\n\u201cOne morning, Tinubu and I were in Abuja and we learnt that the leaders of the new-PDP were meeting at the Kano House, Asokoro, which was not far from where we were staying.\n\n\u201cWe decided to join them. We phoned Buhari to join us too. Ogbonnaya Onu joined us too.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, it became a joint meeting between the APC and the new-PDP. It was a day of our National Executive Committee meeting and all our people were waiting for me at the APC national headquarters.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Kano House, the New-PDP leaders had prepared a document listing conditions under which they would accept to join us. They gave us a copy. Tinubu read it and said all these were unnecessary.\n\n\u201cHe reduced the two-page paper to one page of about three sentences. After some discussion, it was agreeable to both sides. We reduced the agreement to a communiqu\u00e9 and both sides signed it.\n\n\u201cThough he also attended the meeting, Governor Babangida Aliyu of Niger State escaped and was not there when we were addressing the press.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has warned former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, not to set Nigeria on fire with his \u201cdirty politicking.\u201d\n\nIt also boasted that Nigeria is safer than it was in 2015 before the All Progressives Congress (APC) took over power from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nGovernment, through the Minister of Information reiterated that President Muhammadu Buhari has done better than his predecessors in tackling insecurity and insurgency in the North East, amidst difficult economic and social conditions.\n\nOn Monday, Obasanjo, at a retreat on inclusive security in Abuja, organised by the Global Peace Foundation and Vision Africa, said: \u201cPresident Buhari has done his best. If we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing, that means we are whipping a dead horse and there is no need\u2026\u201d\n\nHe added that military action alone cannot end insurgency.\n\nIn its reaction, yesterday, government slammed Obasanjo for disseminating \u201cuntruths and fallacious\u201d statements about Buhari\u2019s leadership.\n\nMohammed, said: \u201cThe polity has recently been awash with heightened commentary on the security situation in the country. The commentary has been triggered by genuine concerns in some circles, and crass politicking or sheer absurdity in others.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to make the issue of security a major plank of his administration\u2019s policy. This is not a surprise, considering the fact that the fight against insecurity is one of the three priority areas of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYes, the security situation has continued to pose a great challenge, but amidst the cacophony of voices \u2013 some genuinely concerned about the situation and others ready to exploit it for selfish ends \u2013 it is easy to forget where we are coming from.\n\n\u201cToday, we only look at the current situation without wondering what would have been had this president not taken the bull by the horns, as far as security is concerned. With the way insurgents were going before this administration came into office, with their control of a vast swath of land the size of Belgium, with their freewheeling attacks in almost a dozen states, including the Federal Capital Territory, which was hit at least five times, perhaps they could have achieved their aim of declaring an Islamic State in Nigeria, if President Buhari had not acted decisively. After all, in 2014, Boko Haram declared a Caliphate in Gwoza after capturing Bama and Gamboru as well as other towns and villages in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. They installed their own Emirs, collected taxes and flew their flag before the military dislodged them.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that, although banditry and kidnapping had fuelled insecurity across the country, the president has continued to provide \u201cquality leadership in order to ensure that our security agencies decisively tackle the cankerworm of insecurity of any hue. No administration in Nigeria\u2019s recent history has provided the security agencies with the hardware needed to tackle insecurity as that of President Buhari, in addition to raising the morale of our security men and women.\n\n\u201cOnly last week, Mr. President commissioned an armada of naval boats and ships in the latest effort to enhance our nation\u2019s maritime security.The army, the air force and the police, among others, have also been receiving modern hardware to strengthen their arsenal\u2026Despite all these, President Buhari has not relented, constantly presiding over meetings of security chiefs to get an update and also issue necessary directives, and not missing any opportunity to offer succour to his countrymen and women, when necessary.\n\n\u201cThe skewed narrative in certain quarters that the president has not shown enough empathy is glib talk. The president has also continued to work with our neighbouring countries and indeed our Western partners to tackle insecurity, especially terrorism. With the entire Sahelian region experiencing a devastating surge in terrorist attacks, more so in the wake of the Libyan crisis, it has become even more imperative for Nigeria to step up regional cooperation to more effectively tackle insecurity \u2013 and that is what Mr. President has been doing.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has done so much, under very difficult economic and social conditions, to tackle insecurity in our country. Not only has he done so much. President Buhari continues to do much more to keep Nigerians safe. To say he has nothing more to offer is untrue, fallacious and smacks of dirty politicking. By boosting the number and capacity of our fighting forces, Mr. President is putting them in good stead to tackle insecurity not just during the life of his administration but long after he would have left office. President Buhari is leaving a legacy of security, infrastructural development, economic prosperity and social cohesion for Nigeria. This may not seem obvious today, amidst daunting challenges, but posterity will be kind to this President\u2026\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is pushing to fill the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) with electoral officers who have unsavoury reputations.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday during plenary at the National Assembly read a letter from President Muhammadu Buhari seeking the screening and subsequent confirmation of nominees for National Commissioners and a Resident Electoral Commissioner for INEC.\n\nNigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe nominees are Mallam Mohammed Haruna (Niger State) North Central - National Commissioner; Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu - Delta State, National Commissioner, South-South; Okeagu Kenneth Nnamdi - Abia State, South-East National Commissioner, Maj. Gen. A.B. Alkali (retd.) - Adamawa State, North-East, National Commissioner, Engr. Prof. Rada H. Gumus - Bayelsa State, South-South, National Commissioner, Mr. Sam Olumeku - Ondo State, South-West, National Commissioner and Olaniyi Olaleye Ijalaye - Ondo State, South-West, Resident Electoral Commissioner.\n\nHowever, some of these are less-than-ideal appointments; though, they are still awaiting the confirmation of the Senate.\n\nFor instance, May Agbamuche-Mbu, re-appointed as a National Commissioner, is a former girlfriend of the Emir of Bichi, Nasiru Ado-Bayero, sources told SaharaReporters on Tuesday.\n\nIt was learnt that she was also nominated to the Presidency by her ex-lover, Emir of Bichi as a favour, especially with the monarch\u2019s closeness to Buhari now as the President\u2019s in-law.\n\nAgbamuche, a former girlfriend to Emir of Bichi, who is the father-in-law of Buhari\u2019s daughter, has been reappointed by Buhari as INEC Commissioner.\n\nAgbamuche-Mdu had previously served as INEC Commissioner from Delta until President Buhari appointed Lauretta Onochie, his aide and a card-carrying member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), to take the position in October 2020.\n\nHowever, the Senate rejected Onochie\u2019s nomination in July 2021.\n\nBuhari in the letter read by the Senate President, Lawan, during plenary on Tuesday listed Agbamuche-Mbu as representing Delta State.\n\nIndeed, the appointments of the national commissioners came about as a direct result of \u2018who they know'.\n\nFor instance, SaharaReporters also learnt that Prof. Rada H. Gumus from Bayelsa State, South-South was nominated by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva.\n\nAnother person said to have been brought into the government by Sylva was Prof. Nelson Brambaifa, who led interim management of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nSaharaReporters in December 2019 reported how Brigadier-General Charles Nengite, a top-ranked soldier in the Nigerian Army, as well as his wife, were arrested by the United States authorities for an unexplained $16 million found in the wife\u2019s account.\n\nAnd it was learnt that Brambaifa and another former Managing Director of the NDDC, Nsima Ekere, were found to have been involved in the launder of slush funds as they both facilitated how Nengite laundered money from the commission through contracts awarded to him.\n\nIt was reported that between 2016 and 2019, Nengite was drafted to the NDDC where he allegedly benefitted from billions of naira in contracts while there.\n\nMeanwhile, the reappointment of Mallam Mohammed Haruna (Niger State) - North Central as National Commissioner came courtesy of the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who was instrumental to the appointment of some other commissioners.\n\nHaruna is another appointment of an oldie by Buhari as the nominee is 70 years old.\n\nHe was born in Ibadan (in present Oyo State) on September 22, 1951, had his primary education in Kano and later attended Government College, Bida, in his hometown in Niger State between 1965 and 1969.\n\nMallam Mohammed Haruna\n\nBut apart from being old, SaharaReporters learnt from a source close to Haruna that he is also \u201csick\u201d.\n\nHaruna worked with the New Nigerian Newspapers Company Ltd between 1976 and 1989, where he rose from a Reporter to Managing Director, and was later a columnist critical of INEC, until his appointment suddenly knocked the spirit of criticism out of him, it was learnt.\n\nHis appointment is somewhat similar to how Buhari re-nominated an 82-year old retired justice, Sylvanus Nsofor, over a month after his nomination as a non-career ambassador was rejected by the Senate.\n\nEventually, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Nsofor, who was favoured by Buhari because he was the only Appeal Court judge with a dissenting vote against the exercise that had returned Olusegun Obasanjo, then incumbent and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as the winner of the Presidential race in 2003.\n\nBuhari, who ran under the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), had challenged the result of the election. But while the other appeal court judges okayed the outcome, Nsofor accused Obasanjo and the PDP of engaging in violence and intimidation tactics.\n\nNsofor died in December 2020 at the age of 85.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Sam Olumeku - Ondo State, South-West, was also brought by INEC chairman, Yakubu, along with Okeagu Kenneth Nnamdi - Abia State, South-East.\n\nSaharaReporters on October 25 reported how the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu had been holding secret meetings with top leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSources had explained that the INEC chair, who is supposed to be neutral and non-partisan, had been holding frequent meetings with Ahmad Lawan, Senate President and Mai Mala Buni, Caretaker Chairman of the ruling APC and governor of Yobe State.\n\nThe appointments of his choice candidates for National Commissioners are believed to be part of the results of the clandestine meetings.\n\nIt would be recalled that Yakubu himself was able to secure a second term in office through the support of a group led by Senate President Lawan, though in exchange for a huge chunk of money.\n\nIt was gathered that the trio had a meeting on Friday, October 22 at a guest house belonging to the Senate President between 10 pm and 1 am.\n\nOne of the sources had stated: \u201cINEC chairman is frequently having private meetings with the duo of the Senate President and Buni at a private guest house owned by the Senate President in Maitama, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe last meeting was held last Friday between 10 pm and 1 am at the Senate President's Guest House on Yedseram Street behind the Inspector-General of Police's residence. It was between the Senate President, INEC chairman and Buni.\n\n\u201cThese three had earlier met but with Governor (Abubakar) Bagudu of Kebbi State and Jigawa State Governor (Mohammed Abubakar) at the same venue some three months ago.\u201d\n\n\"INEC chair, who is supposed to be neutral is now meeting secretly with top members of the ruling party (APC),\" another source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenneth Nnamdi has had his hands dirtied by unsavoury dealings including his involvement in the bribery that ensured Prof. Yakubu got a second term in office as INEC chairman.\n\nSaharaReporters in November 2020 reported how Prof. Yakubu who was desperate to get a second term, was willing to meet any demands made on him to secure a second term.\n\nSee Also Scandal EXPOSED: How INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, Allegedly Paid N3bn To Secure Reappointment\n\nHe had, therefore, paid a princely sum of N2 billion to a group anchored by the Senate President, Lawan and another N1 billion to the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari.\n\nIt was learnt that the huge funds were deployed and mobilised by a civil servant and Director in lNEC by the name of Kenneth Nnamdi, said to be wealthy and in charge of a strategic department of INEC.\n\nIt was reported that the Director was also aided by a contractor to the Commission, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, who represents Niger East Senatorial District of Niger State.\n\n\u201cNational Commissioner, Festus Okoye was also reappointed; this is a former activist who is now corrupted to the bone. Same as Kenneth,\u201d another source noted.",

Gumus from Bayelsa State, South-South was nominated by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva.\n\nAnother person said to have been brought into the government by Sylva was Prof. Nelson Brambaifa, who led interim management of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nSaharaReporters in December 2019 reported how Brigadier-General Charles Nengite, a top-ranked soldier in the Nigerian Army, as well as his wife, were arrested by the United States authorities for an unexplained $16 million found in the wife\u2019s account.\n\nAnd it was learnt that Brambaifa and another former Managing Director of the NDDC, Nsima Ekere, were found to have been involved in the launder of slush funds as they both facilitated how Nengite laundered money from the commission through contracts awarded to him.\n\nIt was reported that between 2016 and 2019, Nengite was drafted to the NDDC where he allegedly benefitted from billions of naira in contracts while there.\n\nMeanwhile, the reappointment of Mallam Mohammed Haruna (Niger State) - North Central as National Commissioner came courtesy of the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who was instrumental to the appointment of some other commissioners.\n\nHaruna is another appointment of an oldie by Buhari as the nominee is 70 years old.\n\nHe was born in Ibadan (in present Oyo State) on September 22, 1951, had his primary education in Kano and later attended Government College, Bida, in his hometown in Niger State between 1965 and 1969.\n\nMallam Mohammed Haruna\n\nBut apart from being old, SaharaReporters learnt from a source close to Haruna that he is also \u201csick\u201d.\n\nHaruna worked with the New Nigerian Newspapers Company Ltd between 1976 and 1989, where he rose from a Reporter to Managing Director, and was later a columnist critical of INEC, until his appointment suddenly knocked the spirit of criticism out of him, it was learnt.\n\nHis appointment is somewhat similar to how Buhari re-nominated an 82-year old retired justice, Sylvanus Nsofor, over a month after his nomination as a non-career ambassador was rejected by the Senate.\n\nEventually, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Nsofor, who was favoured by Buhari because he was the only Appeal Court judge with a dissenting vote against the exercise that had returned Olusegun Obasanjo, then incumbent and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as the winner of the Presidential race in 2003.\n\nBuhari, who ran under the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), had challenged the result of the election. But while the other appeal court judges okayed the outcome, Nsofor accused Obasanjo and the PDP of engaging in violence and intimidation tactics.\n\nNsofor died in December 2020 at the age of 85.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Sam Olumeku - Ondo State, South-West, was also brought by INEC chairman, Yakubu, along with Okeagu Kenneth Nnamdi - Abia State, South-East.\n\nSaharaReporters on October 25 reported how the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu had been holding secret meetings with top leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSources had explained that the INEC chair, who is supposed to be neutral and non-partisan, had been holding frequent meetings with Ahmad Lawan, Senate President and Mai Mala Buni, Caretaker Chairman of the ruling APC and governor of Yobe State.\n\nThe appointments of his choice candidates for National Commissioners are believed to be part of the results of the clandestine meetings.\n\nIt would be recalled that Yakubu himself was able to secure a second term in office through the support of a group led by Senate President Lawan, though in exchange for a huge chunk of money.\n\nIt was gathered that the trio had a meeting on Friday, October 22 at a guest house belonging to the Senate President between 10 pm and 1 am.\n\nOne of the sources had stated: \u201cINEC chairman is frequently having private meetings with the duo of the Senate President and Buni at a private guest house owned by the Senate President in Maitama, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe last meeting was held last Friday between 10 pm and 1 am at the Senate President's Guest House on Yedseram Street behind the Inspector-General of Police's residence.

          "text": "Edukoya, an African-focused online learning platform that empowers learners and their parents to access high-quality education, has raised $3.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Target Global.\n\nParticipating in the round are angel investors like Shola Akinlade, co-founder/CEO of Paystack, Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha, co-founders of Kuda, Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson, co-founders of Stash and Raffael Johnen, CEO of Aux Money\u2014among others.\n\nFounded in May but launched into beta in December this year by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSpecifically, the platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. At least that\u2019s its current proposition. Edukoya includes 24/7 exam preparation & homework tutor help, a data-driven question bank with step-by-step solutions and personalised performance tracking systems.\n\nPublic education in Nigeria is not great; there are too many factors warring against it, from low funding to incompetent teachers to bad government policy. So, quality education is only available to a small proportion of Nigerians.\n\nThe seven-month-old startup says it offers a free, supplementary learning platform, as well as subscription packages with premium features, focused on K-12 learning and exam preparation. This offering combination is expected to reduce the uneven distribution of quality education. The platform operates a 100% online model, which promotes self-paced learning that allows learners to save time and money.\n\nEdukoya app\n\n\u201cOur vision at Edukoya is to redefine online education for the next generation of Africans. Africa has the fastest-growing school-age population globally, with over 260 million students and counting,\u201d Ogundeyi, who was also the founding CMO of Kuda Bank, said while speaking on the new investment. \u201cOur goal is to democratise access and make high-quality instruction and content accessible and affordable to every student, regardless of where he or she lives on the continent.\u201d\n\nLina Chong, Investment Director at Target Global, said they [Target Global] are delighted to lead this investment and partner with Ogundeyi and her impressive team of education technology pioneers. \u201cEdukoya\u2019s mission to provide better quality to millions of African students, combined with the team\u2019s ability to execute on this ambition, left an immediate impression on myself and the whole team at Target Global. Their business has the potential to unlock learner potential and improve lives across generations\u2019.\u201d\n\nEdukoya app\n\nThis funding is the biggest pre-seed investment for African edtech and also the biggest investment raised by a Nigerian female single founder. The company plans to use the funds to go from beta to live launch in Nigeria by 2022. It will also accelerate its product and technology as well as expand its online curriculum content coverage and on-demand tutoring feature for secondary school learners.\n\nRegarding funding, the African edtech scene was off to a slow start this year, but its pulse is finally picking up. Even though it\u2019s a large market to serve, competition is getting stronger with the presence of platforms like uLesson that recently secured a $15m check to double-down on the same market segment Edukoya sets its eyes on.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still too early to know who will emerge as industry leader, regardless of who launches first.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "1da Banton\u2019s \u201cNo Wahala\u201d blew up on Tik Tok. Now he knows its power",
          "text": "A few months ago, Nigerian artiste, 1da Banton, logged into his TikTok account, which he rarely used, only to discover that one of his songs, \u201cNo wahala\u201d, from his Original Machine Vibe album, was being used in videos captioned in French. Because he doesn\u2019t understand French, he Google-translated the captions, then smiled at himself.\n\nThe Afro dancehall artiste\u2019s song was being used in a TikTok challenge that would take his music straight to the ears of millions of fans around the world. Since the challenge began, \u201cNo wahala\u201d has been used as a soundtrack in more than 190,000 videos and was at some point the second most Shazamed song in the world. The song is also charting in over 10 countries, including the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Uganda, and Kenya.\n\nSpeaking on the inspiration for the song, on a video call with TechCabal, from his Lagos apartment, 1da Banton said he set out to create a stress-free vibe and connect with people who just wanted to live their lives without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhen I recorded \u2018No Wahala\u2019, that was how I was feeling, so I put it into music. When my producer, Blaise Beats, played the beat for me, the only thing that came to my head was to write a song that talks about a stress-free life, not a love or party song. I just wanted to make music people could relate to; that no matter the situation or circumstance, you just have to live your life. So, I\u2019m glad we achieved that.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Port-Harcourt, 1da Banton, dropped his debut single in 2015. Since his debut, he has released one EP and collaborated with Ghanaian Afro Dancehall superstar, Stonebwoy.\n\n\u201cNo wahala\u201d means no stress in Nigerian pidgin, a language widely spoken in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe song is featured in videos of afro-dances; reactions or replies to challenges or questions, sometimes from a loved one or crush. Some of the funniest videos under the challenge feature videos of Nigerian social media influencers, James Brown and Idris Okuneye (popularly known as Bobrisky), dancing, kicking a football, or in the gym.\n\n\u201cMy TikTok video on the \u2018No Wahala\u2019 challenge gave me my highest views and engagement on TikTok. I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Yewande Daranijo, an aspiring actress whose first viral TikTok video has over 300,000 views through this challenge.\n\n\u201cI jumped on the challenge, and boom it went viral. I was really excited, and I\u2019m glad I joined the challenge,\u201d said Daranijo who joined the app about seven months ago. Before the challenge, Daranijo did not know about 1da Banton, but now she knows him and believes he will get his due now that a lot of people know his song.\n\n1da Banton recalled that at the time his song was blowing up in France, he wasn\u2019t a regular user of Tik Tok and was still finding his way around the app.\n\n\u201cSo, \u2018No Wahala\u2019 doing so well on TikTok wasn\u2019t me; it was people. I just gave them the song. From now on, it would be a great idea to follow up on TikTok because of the influence it has on music today.\u201d\n\n1da Banton explained that all of his social media\u2014YouTube and Instagram\u2014is growing: \u201cEveryone is trying to check out who sang this amazing song, so all my numbers are going up.\u201d\n\nAnd as Nigerian artiste CKay did a few weeks ago, 1da Banton created a video on TikTok where he tried to claim ownership of the \u201cNo Wahala\u201d sound. He might have been successful with that, but his dance skills in the video were questionable, an assessment he agrees to and laughs about.\n\n\u201cUp until now, a lot of people still don\u2019t know that I am the owner of the song. It\u2019s a gradual process. I just had to make that video as a part of the process. I\u2019m not really a good dancer, but I still had to dance to the song. I needed them to understand that I am the original owner of the song.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, TikTok has taken at least three African songs to the global stage, and it is making Africans feel represented. Somali singer Nimco Happy\u2019s song, \u201cIsii Nafta\u201d, became an internet sensation, with celebrities like Cardi B, Trevor Noah, and Bella Hadid using the song in content. More than 100,000 videos have been created using the song. The viral song which switches between Swahili, English, Arabic, and Somali has left many Somalis celebrating the fact that their culture is in the global spotlight.\n\nCKay\u2019s \u201cLove Nwantiti\u201d also took over TikTok for weeks, earlier this year, with more than three million videos created using the song. As of September of this year, it was the most Shazamed song in the world and charting in 160 countries.\n\nTikTok\u2019s impact on music in Africa is growing and proving to be a massive support for artistes who may now create and strengthen the reach of their music beyond the continent, without a bank-breaking marketing campaign.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Omicron: Event planners, attendees face fresh struggles on Lagos restrictions",
          "text": "Lagos\u2019 fresh ban on social gathering, clad in the form of measures to mitigate the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, has activated new struggles for event planners and attendees, dampening hopes of festivity with impractical guidelines.\n\nIn lieu of the outright suspension of concerts, carnivals, parties, night-clubbing, and restriction on time and occupancy at worship centres imposed in December 2020, the government\u2019s directive this year is that anyone attending an event has to provide proof of partial or full vaccination and must undergo a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).\n\nThe test is expected to be done either at an event venue or in selected private laboratories 24 hours before an event, a move considered an unrealistic expectation.\n\nEvent organisers are required to request rapid tests at event sites through an application on the Lagos State Safety Commission website: www.lasgsafetyreg.com.\n\nIt is unclear if organisers should foot the bill of the tests out-of-pocket for all attendants or the state government that has failed to make testing accessible to all, with symptoms that fit its case definition of COVID-19 infection will be keen to offer testing to worshippers, party-goers and night-clubbers, among others.\n\nPeople expressing symptoms of COVID-19 in Lagos are often referred from state-run hospitals to private laboratories to pay out-of-pocket for tests.\n\nInformation required on the event safety clearance form provided on the website of the safety commission covers mainly event name, type, start date, end date, start time, end time, name and address of event venue, estimated guests, venue capacity, social centre number of event venue and available parking.\n\nMany are worried that this would dovetail into another bout of selective enforcement on corporate and organised private groups, leaving many informal groups to enjoy festivity inhibited.\n\nPublic health experts, who spoke with BusinessDay, say the motif to block potential super spreader events for COVID-19 infections is proactive but scores the means ineffective and impracticable.\n\nThey say the best measures remain promotion of social distancing, face-masking, and curbing of overcrowded events.\n\nRead also: Management institute tasked on strategies to mitigate impact of Covid-19 on organizations\n\nAkin Osibogun, a professor of Public Health at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, questions the practicality of testing at all events in a state that is both the melting point of Nigeria\u2019s cultural and entertainment activities and the most populated.\n\n\u201cHow practicable is it? As we are talking now parties are happening at Yaba, Surulere, and Lagos Island. Well, if local governments are active they might be able to monitor them. But to say that party goers will take rapid diagnostic tests is not practicable,\u201d Osibogun said.\n\n\u201cThey need to be clearer as to what they expect. This virus is still mutating. Fortunately, so far, the information we have about the Omicron is that it is not so virulent. But we don\u2019t know what other variant will emerge. If a more virulent variant emerges, then we will be in trouble. So, the best thing is to take precautions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen BusinessDay contacted Adewumi Okoh, public affairs officer, Lagos Safety Commission, for clarifications and answers on the practicality of enforcing these guidelines at all events at this period, she declined, asking that questions be directed to the director-general via a text or mail.\n\nOkoh later linked this reporter up with Lanre Mojola, the director-general, who explained that the new rule was part of efforts to stem the spread of Omicron and was mainly designed for large events of over 500 people, exempting religious programmes.\n\nHe did not clarify who is to foot the bill, but said there had been an uptick in compliance rate with the Commission moving from registering about 400 events weekly on the average to 1,000 since the state government officially reeled out the new rule.\n\n\u201cIf you are organising an event of over 500 people, your duty is to ensure that people who are not vaccinated do not come into those event. The whole point is for people to go and get vaccinated. In the event that you have not been vaccinated, then we are requesting for a negative PCR test, within 72 hours,\u201d Mojola said.\n\n\u201cOnce you have failed to be guided by the Lagos State Infectious Disease regulation of 2020, we will kick in terms of enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from testing, the vaccination rate has also been poor with the racing to move the percentage up from 1.6 percent to 30 percent within the next year. The state is targeting 8 million doses for four out of over 20 million residents under its Count Me in Campaign, yet expects that every event attendee this festive season must carry a vaccination proof.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governor on Tuesday, announced that the state was now seeing early indications of a fourth wave with a current positivity rate at 6 percent, from 0.1 percent mid-November.\n\nAs of December 5, Lagos had recorded a total of 78,564 confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nWhereas, as of December 27, 2020, confirmed cases were 28,774. It was the beginning of the second wave as average daily cases moved between 100 and 459. The positivity rate was at 16 percent.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, the fourth wave was brought by the non-adherence to the laid down protocols to mitigate this pandemic. I would want to use this opportunity once again appeal to everyone to get vaccinated and join hands with the state government in managing this wave of pandemic in this festive season by following the guidelines we have set, especially regarding the use of face masks, public gatherings and travelling in and out of Lagos State,\u201d he said in a press statement.\n\nA film-maker, who asked to be identified as Aquala, assessing the guidelines, said people could be more encouraged to adhere if the government takes on the responsibility of testing.\n\nIf implemented otherwise, the impact will not be limited to the entertainment industry alone but could spread to the entire economy.\n\n\u201cIt means that if people cannot do events, then they will be forced to lay-off staff. I don\u2019t think the government has any economic or welfare plans to cushion unpaid people this festive season. You cannot make a rule that is not economically viable. If you are saying tests should be done, then the tests should be provided by the government,\u201d he said.\n\nOkafor Valentine, chief executive of OVC Entertainment, an organisation that trains models and organises fashion shows, said the policy would affect his business negatively by reducing viewership of his shows, cutting ticket sales.\n\nAlthough he thinks that the wellbeing of his team is of priority and everyone must do what they can to reduce the spread of COVID-19\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fully vaccinated and I\u2019ve advised my team members to do the same. I have friends that died of COVID-19. I also have friends that survived COVID-19. So, if people are saying there is no COVID-19 or they want to turn deaf ears to prevention measures, it is left to them,\u201d he said.",

They are to be sold to Shoprite Holdings Limited, South Africa.\n\nThe company\u2019s second quarter 2021 financial statement, in which it made the intention to sell the malls public, clarifies that Shoprite Holdings is the larger South African Holdco, not the Nigerian entity that was recently sold to Ketron Investment Limited.\n\nShoprite had made a clean break from Nigeria after 16 years of operation, disposing of 100 percent of its equity stake in its Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited subsidiary. The South African retail chain had, in August 2020, announced that it was discontinuing operations in Nigeria, citing a re-evaluation of its operating model.\n\nSo far, Resilient Africa\u2019s Nigerian portfolio covers up to 30,015 square metres of lettable retail space in the three malls. Delta Mall, completed in 2016, has a gross lettable area of 13,363sqm while Owerri Mall, completed in 2016, has a gross lettable area of 8,686sqm.\n\nExperts say the company\u2019s decision to sell its portfolios in Nigeria paints a gloomy picture of the present state and future of the retail sector in Nigeria which, in turn, reflects the state of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAt the peak of retail development in Nigeria, Resilient Africa, a property development and investment company established by Resilient REIT Limited, had come into Nigeria with strong focus on the country\u2019s second tier cities where it saw opportunities for its planned investments. All that seems to have changed, given the present development.\n\nRead also: Tony Elumelu Foundation funds 5000 African SMEs from 54 countries for its 2021 Entrepreneurship Programme\n\n\u201cAccording to this year\u2019s integrated annual report, the company\u2019s Board resolved to dispose of all Resilient\u2019s operations in Nigeria. Those operations are held through a 60.94 percent interest in two South African incorporated companies, Resilient Africa and Resilient Africa Managers, in partnership with Shoprite Holdings Limited,\u201d Dolapo Omidire, founder/ CEO, Estate Intel, explained to BusinessDay.\n\nHe explained further that an in-principle agreement had been reached to dispose of the portfolio/operations and, consequently, their subsidiaries are now being carried as discontinued operations (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations).\n\nThe planned sale of the three malls tells the current story of Nigerian retail business, which was once the darling of the commercial real estate space, where optimistic private equity investors took high-risk positions.\n\nNigeria\u2019s retail industry has had it tough for the past few years. Even though it may appear that some stability is in view, there are reasons to believe that the rebound may take longer than expected.\n\nA major reason is that anchor tenants are reducing their footprint. Many of them have left, citing challenges like supply-chain disruptions and challenges in getting funds out of the country as reasons it has struggled to operate in the country.\n\nBefore now, analysts had been upbeat with optimism on foreign interest in the Nigerian market. \u201cThere has been a strong interest from notable international brands (not just the regular South Africa ones) who are eager to come to the Nigerian market in recent time and this enhances the take-off of these malls when delivered,\u201d Chu\u2019di Ejekam, a former director at Actis, told BusinessDay.\n\nBut the market has seen a tumble which, according to Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at CSL Stockbrokers, \u201cis in line with the expectation that foreign retailers will begin to exit the market, considering the distortion in economic activities, continued devaluation of the naira and the weaker consumer market.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Gbolahan Ologunro, a research analyst at Lagos-based CSL Stockbrokers, noted that Shoprite had, overtime, been highlighted as one of the key areas for investments in the country and now that they are leaving, it gives the industry a blurry picture of the tough operating environment in the country.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I think they have not seen policies that will unlock those potentials. The middle class is shrinking and they are the ones that shop the more on a regular basis,\u201d Ologunro said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Wednesday in Abuja, winged four pilots and 12 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operators who successfully completed their Basic Helicopter Pilot Training at the Draken Europe Helicopter Academy, U.K.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed delight for the additional expertise in the NAF ever-expanding inventory of manned and unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nAmao noted that the training was part of his vison of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for deployment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that, through foresight and diligence, we are effectively engaging one of the key drivers of my vision which is to pursue purposeful training and human capacity development.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is based on the premise that, for NAF to function efficiently, both as a highly technical service and as a fighting force for the effective defence of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, it must have the right numerical strength.\n\n\u201cAnd, more importantly, the right quality of manpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to train personnel of all specialties both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, officers, airmen and airwomen of the service are undergoing training in various countries including the U.S., South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, hundreds of personnel across all specialties are being trained locally in spite of budgetary constraints.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pilot training, 11 student pilots are currently undergoing training in South Africa, while three are undergoing Alpha Jet conversion in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, 12 student pilots are undergoing Super Tucano training and four student pilots are undergoing helicopter training in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed, two of these student helicopter pilots have completed their training and are expected to graduate very soon.\u201d\n\nThe CAS added that, within the country, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training while two have recently completed jet conversion at 403 Flying Training School, Kano.\n\nHe added that 12 student pilots were undergoing Basic Transport Training, 32 undergoing Ab-Initio Flying Training and eight undergoing Instructor Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 22 trainees are undergoing UAV Initial and Basic Training at 401 FTS, while 16 student pilots are undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training at the International Helicopter Flying School Enugu.\u201c\n\nAmao explained that all these efforts were targeted at ensuring combat readiness at significantly higher levels to counter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of this, we also recently reviewed the curricula for the various schools in the NAF Institute of Technology to meet expected standards, while also conducting instructional training for the instructors to ensure enhanced performance.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the training curriculum for NAF cadets in the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has been reviewed and new criteria specified for NAF officers that can be eligible for posting to the Academy as instructors.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I authorised the audit of selected ground and flying institutions in NAF by a team of experienced retired senior officers with a view to upgrading the practices and facilities at the institutions to meet international standards.\u201c\n\nAmao noted that the ongoing efforts would go a long way in positioning the institutions as centres of excellence in producing pilots, engineers, technicians and other specialists.\n\nThis, he said, would avail the personnel the opportunity to be well equipped to carry out their constitutional roles more effectively and efficiently in the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cSpecial arrangements are also currently being made to upgrade UAV training facilities to enhance the operational capacity of UAV operators in anticipation of increased tempo of air operations with the recently acquired UAVs.\n\n\u201cWhile sustaining capacity building programmes for the NAF Regiment in joint efforts for synergy of air-ground integrated operations with sister services.\u201c\n\nThe CAS congratulated the young pilots and UAVs operators for successfully completing their various courses.\n\n\u201cYou have put in the necessary hard work to get to this stage and your efforts have been recognised with the pinning of wings on your uniforms.\n\n\u201cYou have therefore, left the stage of student aviators and have become pilots and UAV operators responsible for utilisation of national resources in our counter-insurgency and other security efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that you apply and build on your current experiences during your pre-deployment tactical training.\n\n\u201cLike I advised the last set of pilots and UAV operators, you must be relentless in the pursuit of excellence and professionalism as operational pilots and operators, while working with your colleagues across other specialties in the service.\n\n\u201cYou must also strive to imbibe the doctrine of jointness at the frontlines as you interact with personnel from our sister services and other security agencies in pursuit of national securities imperatives.\u201c\n\nAmao thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the enabling environment for NAF and the entire Armed Forces to function more effectively.\n\nEarlier, the Chief of Training and Operations, AVM James Gwani, noted that the winging was the 5th under the administration of Amao.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the young pilots would boost NAF\u2019s operational manpower, especially as the service was inducting and expecting more platforms to address the various security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cI most sincerely express profound gratitude and appreciation to CAS, whose leadership has created the enabling environment for timely turn out of pilots and UAV operators in the NAF.\n\n\u201cTo the pilots and UAV operators, tomorrow brings a new journey, but today marks the end of a chapter in your career as you have become qualified pilots and UAV operators.\u201d\n\n...",

The stakes are too high; we cannot allow Nigeria to continue the way it is going.\n\n\u201cOur great party must come to the rescue and take over the reins of power in this country. What we see ahead is not pleasant at all. I just pray that God Almighty sees us through next year, financially, so that we can even have presidential elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t just see how we can continue to be deceiving ourselves. We try to prevent the country from growing by limiting and restricting imports, coming with all forms of phantom excuses to limit people from buying and importing what they cannot produce and need to live.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, they are restricting foreign exchange availability; they are just throwing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commitment today is to our great party, the PDP.

So, he is eminently qualified to contest the position of President of Nigeria and as you know, at the end of the day, power ultimately comes from God.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dokpesi commended the governor for his giant strides and transformational projects embarked upon by his administration since he assumed office.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe way and manner that people are suffering across the country is not acceptable. We have never been so divided as a nation; everybody now refers to us as the poverty capital of the world. All the indices clearly show that we are a failed state.\n\n\u201cEven in Abuja, we are afraid of the possibility of invasion by Boko Haram, bandits, and unknown gunmen.

          "title": "CBN Set To Tighten Monetary Policy in 2022",
          "text": "By Lukman Otunuga\n\nAs inflationary pressures ease and economic growth slowly recovers, it remains a matter of \u2018when, not if\u2019 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will raise interest rates in 2022.\n\nOther central banks have already joined the global tightening train in 2021 including South Africa, New Zealand, and Brazil among many others. With inflation across the globe rising in the face of supply chain disruptions, higher energy prices, and improving consumer demand, financial conditions are set to tighten as more central banks take action. As this era of easy money comes to an end, this certainly does not bode well for emerging markets \u2013 especially those with higher dollar-denominated debt. Tighter policy in developed economies certainly remains one of the biggest risks to the outlook for emerging markets. When considering how Nigeria\u2019s total public debt stood at $87.24 billion earlier this year, this is a theme that must not be overlooked in the new year.\n\nMarket expectations remain elevated over the Federal Reserve speeding up tapering and re-evaluating the timings of future interest rate hikes. There is a risk of a potential domino effect with the Fed\u2019s eventual rate hike accelerating the shift towards monetary tightening across the globe. Traders are currently pricing in a 72% probability of at least one rate hike by early May 2022 and a 100% probability by mid-June next year. This comes after the U.S. consumer price index for November jumped 6.8% year-on-year, overtaking the 6.2% increase in October which was the highest level seen since 1982.\n\nFor Nigeria, the question remains whether higher interest rates are the right medication for the country\u2019s ongoing illness. Higher interest rates may support the Naira and control inflation which fell for the seventh straight month in October. However, such a move could also discourage business investment and consumption at a time where the country remains on a fragile road to recovery. So, the question is whether the CBN will raise rates to help the Naira or raise rates to prevent from being behind the curve. Whatever the decision, it will certainly have an impact on Nigeria\u2019s economy which is projected to expand 2.7% in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nLooking beyond monetary policy, other themes that are likely to impact Nigeria\u2019s growth revolves around oil prices and the Omicron menace. Oil prices recently secured their biggest weekly gain since August despite ongoing uncertainty revolving around the Omicron variant. WTI and Brent are both up over 45% since the start of 2021. However, expectations around oil markets returning to oversupply in the coming months may cap upside gains. With the Omicron variant threatening global demand and OPEC+ moving ahead with its planned January oil output rise of 400,000 bpd, oil remains vulnerable to downside losses. Given how a handsome chunk of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings and government revenues are sourced from oil sales, falling oil prices could threaten the country\u2019s economic outlook.\n\nIn regards to Covid-19, Omicron cases are rising with the United Kingdom banning travel from Nigeria. Other countries have taken similar steps in an effort to contain the more contagious variant. While it may be early to gauge the economic impacts, it may be wise to keep a close eye on how this will impact relations moving into 2022. Nevertheless, the threat of new Covid-19 variants remains a major risk that could derail the global economic recovery. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the pace of vaccine rollouts was the main driver behind the positive economic forecasts. However, the risk of more aggressive vaccine-resistance Covid-19 variants poses a serious risk to developed and developing economies. It will be interesting to see how Nigeria fares in 2022 as it juggles domestic and external risks.\n\nFor more information, please visit: FXTM\n\nLukman Otunuga, Senior Research Analyst at FXTM\n\nDisclaimer: This written/visual material is comprised of personal opinions and ideas.

          "title": "At Sam Nda-Isaiah\u2019s First Memorial: Call For Assent To Electoral Bill Resonates",
          "text": "The necessity for the president to give assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was highlighted again at First Memorial Lecture to honour the late founding chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Sam Nda-Isaiah.\n\nThe media mogul passed away on December 11, 2020 after a brief illness.\n\nSpeaking at the memorial event, the founding chairman and editor-in-chief of ThisDay Media Group and Arise News Channel, Nduka Obaigbena, added his voice in urging President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.\n\nPrince Obaigbena made the call during a panel session on how political parties fared on \u2018The Big Ideas\u2019 \u2013 Nda-Isaiah\u2019s slogan during his presidential aspiration in 2015, saying the law was needed to enthrone a sound electoral system where every vote counts.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a sound electoral process where every vote counts. So, I urge the minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to ensure that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is signed immediately and then we begin to look for leaders who will position our country for the next generations.\u201d\n\nOn the present security challenges in the country, Obaigbena advocated a security tax to adequately fund the security agencies in order to equip them properly to curb the current insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cSo, one way I believe is to have a security tax. We all pay taxes every day to secure ourselves. So, if we have a security tax that is managed by a trusteeship, they can have the equipment, then I think we can go somewhere.\u201d\n\nHe noted securing Nigerians is a key challenge facing this government.\n\nObaigbena also called for a national consensus to identify little ideas from big ideas and to begin to implement them, \u201cso as to put our houses in order to secure the lives and property, and educate people, provide water supply and other basic things.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe can also solve these problems by restructuring the way revenue is distributed so that the states don\u2019t come begging the federal government for one thing or the other.\u201d\n\nHe also paid tributes to, not only the late Sam Nda-Isaiah, but also to three other senior journalists who died recently \u2013 Samaila Isah Funtua, Wada Maida and the late chief of staff to the president, Abba Kyari.\n\nNda-Isaiah believed Nigeria could be fixed \u2013 Kuru\n\nOn his part, the chief executive officer and managing director, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Ahmed Kuru, said the late Sam Nda-Isaiah\u2019s political ambition was driven by his conviction that Nigeria\u2019s woes could easily be fixed.\n\nKuru, in his tribute during the lecture to honour Sam Nda-Isaiah, said he had never come across such a passionate person like Sam.\n\n\u201cHis political ambition was driven by his conviction that Nigeria could easily be fixed, and he was driven by that objective and almost forgot the process. Quite a lot of people played and betrayed him. After the loss, we analysed the outcome and I frankly told him where we went wrong.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t hold back tears during our conversation. Two hours afterward, he followed me home to thank me for the candour. I have never come across a passionate person like Sam, so passionate even in his naivety. You had to get close to him to know how soft he was, but you also had to be exceedingly accommodating and patient to enjoy his company.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that Sam\u2019s brain was always on fire, particularly in the middle of the night/early morning, adding that impossibility did not exist in his book.\n\nKuru further remarked that Nda-Isaiah saw potential in every idea and pursued all initiatives and opportunities concurrently, thereby always running thin on resources.\n\n\u201cHe was always in a hurry to succeed; he had zero tolerance for failure,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe AMCON boss also described the late Nda-Isaiah as a very emotional person, adding that he was very loyal to his friends.\n\n\u201cHowever bad we were, he stood by us. His popular saying was \u2018everybody has his own son of a bitch\u2019. He brought so many people to me for assistance after acknowledging that they were bad or not honest, but nonetheless needed help and must be helped.\n\n\u201cIf Sam considered you a friend, you could go to sleep. You can hardly find a friend like Sam. He celebrated his friends and was proud of them regardless of their faults.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still weeps each time he remembers something about the late Nda-Isaiah.\n\nIn her tribute, an in-law to the Nda-Isaiahs, Halima Remawa-Fufore, said everyone that came in contact with the founding chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, would tell you that he was forthright and uncompromising when it came to his core beliefs.\n\nRemawa-Fufore, who is an assistant director with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said the late Nda-Isaiah was able to achieve a lot in his brief sojourn in this world.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cJust to tell you how simple, humble and obliging he was, he touched people\u2019s lives positively as anyone who encountered him always left his presence encouraged, confident and more optimistic.\n\n\u201cHis door was always open to all that needed his counsel. In addition to being very passionate about his family, he lived his life congruently true to the motto of his newspaper, \u201cFor God and Country\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe had boundless energy and intellect, as well as the commitment and courage to always speak the truth. We miss him but he is in a better place as God knows best. I know we will all remember him even though he is no longer with us.\u2019\u2019\n\nA pioneer employee of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Kingsley Chukwu, in his tribute said the late chairman had a passion for the business of producing a quality newspaper which imparted on people like him.\n\nHe described the late Nda-Isaiah as a very accommodating person and tolerant, \u201cbut he could not stand unnecessary mistakes, which kept many of us on our toes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose of us in production have to make sure that we follow the dummy strictly. While he detested incompetence and mistakes in the paper, he also rewarded diligence, hard work and commitment to assigned responsibilities.\n\n\u201cHe also ensured that those of us in production had the working tools we needed. I miss his passion for LEADERSHIP, his drive for excellence and innovation to make the paper the best in the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nChukwu also noted that Nda-Isaiah had left a legacy of excellence in the media industry and lauded the management of LEADERSHIP Group Limited for sustaining the founding chairman\u2019s legacy and moving the newspaper forward.\n\nAlso, an in-law to the founding chairman, Dr Tunde Owoyele, in his tribute, said the late Nda-Isaiah touched the lives of many positively, adding that his door was always open to all and will always be remembered as Uncle Sam.\n\nHe always put his country first \u2013 Lai Mohammed\n\nSpeaking at the event, minister of information and culture, Lai Mohammed called on other newspapers in the country to borrow a leaf from the LEADERSHIP and put the interest of the country ahead of all other considerations.\n\nMohammed, who spoke as a panelist at the memorial lecture in honour of the late Sam Nda-Isaiah, said his passion for Nigeria never waned.\n\n\u201cI want other newspapers to borrow a leaf from LEADERSHIP because LEADERSHIP Newspaper put country first before any interest. You hardly see LEADERSHIP sensationalise any story,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the late Nda-Isaiah as a patriot who was interested in a united and peaceful Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was always patriotic and ready to help in affairs of the state. His dream was for a united and peaceful Nigeria. The late Sam Nda-Isaiah will be happy that he is remembered by those he called friends.\n\n\u201cSam was a brother, but above all, Sam was a patriot. He loved Nigeria and believed in possibility. He did not participate on the sidelines; he was one of the aspirants to fly the flag of the APC after the merger.\n\n\u201cHis passion for Nigeria never waned after losing the ticket to President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAccording to the information minister, the late Nda-Isaiah used his medium to constructively criticise government but also believed that government needed support.\n\n\u201cI admired his willingness to do anything for Nigeria. I miss him a lot because he was a standing board for me, \u201d he said.\n\nOn how government has met its campaign promises, he said it is rare for any aspirant to understand how bad a situation is unless he/she assumes office to face the stark reality.\n\nHe said the government had committed resources to fighting insecurity which would have been used to create jobs and provide infrastructure.\n\nHe did not die in vain \u2013 SGF\n\nFor his part, the secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, said the late media guru did not die in vain, as he impacted many lives positively.\n\nMr Mustapha said the late pharmacist and politician touched lives, uplifted the down-trodden and provided comfort to those that had lost hope.\n\nDescribing Nda-Isaiah\u2019s death as a big loss to Nigeria, Mustapha said his life was one of service, passion, doggedness and living for country.\n\n\u201cSam\u2019s life was a clear and resounding message, subtle in its delivery and profound with its impact. A message of service, passion, commitment, loyalty, doggedness, love for country and legacy. Sam gave meaning to the age-old truism that it is not how long but how well we live our lives that matters,\u201d Mustapha who was chairman of the memorial event said yesterday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe lives he touched, the processes he changed, the down-trodden that he uplifted, the advice he gave for the good of the country and even the comfort he provided for those that have lost hope are already speaking for him,\u201d he stated.\n\nMustapha said his death is not only a loss to the LEADERSHIP Group or to the profession of journalism.\n\n\u201cNeither is his death a loss to the pharmacist profession or his family and political associates but to the Nigerian nation for not internalising the best in him before his death, \u201d he added.\n\nThe SGF said the challenge before his family and friends was to sustain his dreams for a better society.\n\nHe expressed gladness that this first year\u2019s memorial reception was a sure path towards immortalising not only the man, Sam Nda-Isaiah, but most importantly, his ideas and the things he spent his life in pursuit of.\n\nHe\u2019ll be forever remembered by Nigerians \u2013 Aisha Buhari\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn her address, the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, yesterday described the late Nda-Isaiah as a personality that will be forever remembered by every Nigerian.\n\nThe First Lady said Nigerians will remember him, not only because they loved him, but also because of how he lived his life and the many ways he impacted people\u2019s lives positively.\n\nAccording to her, the late Nda-Isaiah may be many things to different people: a political columnist, a politician, pharmacist, journalist and founder and chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, but to his family, he was a loving husband; and she and the first family, he was an associate who they called \u2018my President\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe converge here to remember Sam who left us a year ago. We remember him today as we have done since he left and we will remember him tomorrow and for the rest of our lives.\n\n\u201cOver the course of his life, Sam ventured into diverse fields for as wide as his imaginations could take him. He was a true definition of a serial entrepreneur, but all that he ventured in were geared towards building and developing our nation and as a service to humanity,\u201d he said.\n\nShe said that she was sure there are only a few Nigerians with the kind of energy the late Sam Nda-Isaiah had.\n\n\u201cThat is what enabled him to break boundaries, make friends all over Nigeria and beyond. This is what accorded him traditional titles from all segments of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo Zainab, you have been very strong since Sam\u2019s departure, please remain strong. The children, the family, his business empire, and the rest of us need you more than ever because your strength and visibility give us a sense of Sam\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cWe will surely miss you, Sam, and but we take comfort that you have lived a good and memorable life. I pray that your soul may continue to rest in peace,\u201d Aisha Buhari said.\n\nHe was a great, passionate husband, says wife, Zainab\n\nIn her speech, the chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Zainab Nda-Isaiah, described the late Nda-Isaiah as a great and passionate husband.\n\nShe said her late husband grabbed life by the horns and also expected high standards from his family always.\n\n\u201cOn that day of this death, I didn\u2019t think it was possible to go on, but God has been faithful to me and my family. The first day my husband introduced himself to me, he said \u2018I am Sam\u2019 and the next thing he said was \u2018I want to marry you.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was very straight forward; he did not believe in wasting time and, to him, the best time to do something was yesterday, not today.\n\n\u201cHe grabbed life by the horns and he expected high standards from us. There are many times he fell short but he never gave up on his aspirations.\n\n\u201cWe had a very wonderful relationship. I never called him by any name except \u2018Sweety\u2019 and, in fact, there was a time we were coming back from church and we had given some people a lift and they asked my daughter her father\u2019s name and she replied \u2018Sweety\u2019.\n\nContinuing she said, \u201cI thank God for everything. In life he was a great and passionate husband and even in death, he put everything in place for us to make sure that we did not lack anything.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking about the benevolent nature of the deceased, a close friend of the family, Martina Kobe expressed her sadness at his death.\n\nAccording to Martina Kobe, \u201cSam was there for me when other people abandoned me when I was having some challenges after I lost my husband. Sam encouraged me to start a restaurant business in Abuja and later a fashion house. He also was buying my medication until his death.\n\n\u201cSam did so much for people; he was indeed my son and also became my father. Affliction will not rise the second time, God will raise people like Sam to continue to be a blessing to his family.\u201d\n\nSister of the late publisher, Mary Owoyele also extolled her brother\u2019s virtues, lamenting that the loss had dealt a big blow to the family.\n\n\u201cWhen I was praying last year in Shiloh, I saw that an iroko tree had fallen, not knowing that the passing of Sam was imminent. I felt like the whole world had caved in.\n\n\u201cMy brother was very bold and smart, very tough outside but very soft inside. He was my role model; I thank God for having him as my brother. Sam wrote his stories and touched lives more than we can imagine.\u201d\n\nLydia Ageni, another sister of the late media mogul, also talked about her brother.\n\n\u201cI cry almost every day since the day he died. Sam was a disciplinarian; he gave me money to start my business when things got very tough. There is no gift that my brother can\u2019t give to anyone. He helped me when I was in school.\n\n\u201cWe thank God that we can mention his name and stand proud. We thank God for blessing us with Sam; he will forever be in our hearts.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Dul, cousin of the late serial entrepreneur, described him as a very spiritual and generous person.\n\n\u201cSam was very spiritual; he had a personal relationship with God. I believe he made heaven. Most times, all we discussed was about God. He prayed even before getting married to his wife.\n\n\u201cSam was very responsible as a youth. I remember he gave his last car to the church and we started trekking. Sam also removed his shoes and gave it to a Muslim that converted to Christianity and walked bare-footed home that day.\u201d\n\nBishop Edwin Musa Jarumai, Bishop of Abuja Diocese of the Praise Church, corroborated that Nda-Isaiah had a personal relationship with God before his death.\n\nHe said that the late Nda-Isaiah lived a life that pleased God, just as he encouraged the family to hold on to his legacies.\n\n\u201cSam was a person who had a personal relationship with God. Let me remind us on this memorial day that you must not be 120 years before you die, but what you will be remembered for when you die is the most important.\n\n\u201cDear brothers and sisters, let us look to where there is life after death. There is judgement when we meet God, so we should live a life that God will be happy with us.\u201d\n\nHe further went down memory lane on how the late Nda-Isaiah got married to his wife Zainab.\n\n\u201cHow Sam got the name Uncle Sam, it was because in our group of friends then, we were all married except Sam. So we started calling him Uncle Sam because we wanted to provoke him so that he could get married. That was what led Sam to meet Zainab and he decided to marry her and they got married eventually,\u201d he said.\n\nThis Occasion Should Bring Us Some Closure\n\n\u2013Thomas-Odey\n\nA close friend of the late founding chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Limited, Harry Thomas-Odey, in his tribute yesterday, said the first memorial of Sam Nda-Isaiah was the answer to the question of whether his death was real.\n\nMr Thomas-Odey said he was gratified that the late Nda-Isaiah\u2019s most cherished treasures \u2013 Zainab, Joshua, Fatima, David, Esther, Mary, Mama and indeed all his brothers and sisters \u2013 were coping as best as they could.\n\n\u201cIf Anyone is still in any doubt whatsoever that the drama that only Sam could have pulled on Friday Dec 11, 2020 was real and if indeed you are like some of us who have found creative ways of avoiding the use of past tenses in references to Sam, all in denial , this occasion today is our answer and most probably should put us out of our misery and bring us some closure.\n\n\u201cI am most gratified that what Sam treasured the most, Zainab, Joshua, Fatima David. Esther, Mary, Mama and indeed all his brothers and sisters to whom he was a pillar, are coping as best they can, with his absence and I am confident he will be very proud of them wherever he may be at this time.\n\n\u201cOne point most people will agree on, is that Sam took responsibility and gave of himself, more than 200% in any venture, idea or cause he took fancy to and had the uncanny ability to bring life to most things with words!\n\n\u201cSam believed in possibilities, as no mountain was high enough no river too wide or valley too deep. Sam took on every thing no matter the scope with equal vigor and passion that you wondered what drove him.\n\n\u201cSam not only took ownership and responsibility, his sense of responsibility was sometimes annoying as indeed his attention to details, such that when you queried him with \u201cwhat\u2019s your own in this matter?\u201d Sam would typically reply with what do you mean? More like, are you seriously asking me why I should take ownership or responsibility?\n\n\u201cSometimes one wonders if indeed Sam did not have at the back of his mind that his time here on earth would be short when you think back to the intensity and urgency that he brought to every thing he took on,\u201d he said.\n\nSam was defined by his courage, determination to succeed \u2013 Dare\n\nOn his part, the minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, described the late chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Sam Nda-Isaiah, as a man whose determination paid off in success despite the many challenges he encountered.\n\nDare described the late Nda-Isaiah as a go-getter who strived to attain excellence and accomplish goals even in the face of difficulties.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cHis death remains a shock. As a professional colleague, I have known him for over 20 years and Sam is defined by his courage, his ability to take risks and his determination to succeed.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a pharmacist leave the medical profession and delve into journalism and then succeed, you will know that Sam is a go-getter and whatever he desired to do, he would work hard to make sure it was a success.\u201d",
          "summary": "The necessity for the president to give assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was highlighted again at First Memorial Lecture to honour the late founding chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, Sam Nda-Isaiah.\nKuru, in his tribute during the lecture to honour Sam Nda-Isaiah, said he had never come across such a passionate person like Sam.\nThe late Sam Nda-Isaiah will be happy that he is remembered by those he called friends.\n\u201cOver the course of his life, Sam ventured into diverse fields for as wide as his imaginations could take him.\nShe said that she was sure there are only a few Nigerians with the kind of energy the late Sam Nda-Isaiah had.",

          "text": "Brainy Age initiative, a women and children based Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) has provided financial support to 30 indigent women to enable them do businesses and take care of themselves and children.\n\nTeam lead of the organisation, Henrietta Agboje, made this known while distributing the funds to the women at the new Kuchingoro Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP) camp located beside games village in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Agboje, the donations became pertinent following the needs assessment carried out at the camp to ascertain their growth since the organisation\u2019s last visit.\n\nShe said since 2018, they had embarked on outreaches to encourage enrollment of their children into school and the women into skills acquisition and businesses.\n\n\u201cOver the years since 2018 precisely we have been working with the teenagers and children in this Kuchingoro IDP camp , this year we decided to work with the women checking our progress reports we do lots of sensitization for them on chosen topics such as education, drugs , peer pressure and so on.\n\n\u201cThis year we choose to enlighten them on Gender Based Violence (GBV) which is a global thing. We have come to empower the children with books, and the women with loans for business,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are empowering 30women with financial support of which we did needs assessment to those that requires the support because some of them have gone through trainings and started the business but the growth of the business has not been stable. We were able to ascertain those who really needs funds and so we have solicited for funds for them and today we are supporting them financially based on needs assessment,\u201d she added.\n\nThe team lead further stressed the importance of empowerment for indigent women, stressing that economic empowerment for all especially women is key to lasting peace and security in the country.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cIt is important to empower these women because they are raising children, and like the saying goes women are the nation builders so if you impact their lives you impact the live of the who family like their children, the young adults and men as well and that would also curb the social vices. Once a woman is able to do something, she is able to contribute to her family.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that the government should put more efforts in ensuring peace in their various localities so they can live more meaningfully and in peace. We also advise them to always talk to their children not to engage in bad vices and then hope to return back to their villages.\u201d\n\nOne of the team members, a Public Health Scientist, Pamela Gado, expressed concerns on the increasing rate of gender based violence in the society, stressing the need for all to end the myths by identifying and advocating zero tolerance in order to totally eliminate the menace.\n\n\u201cGender Based Violence is a menace and is quite endemic in our country for generations . It is something that has been perpetrated for long and and I think one of the biggest lies is that it is part of culture. When the society embraces certain behaviors it tolerates certain ones it begins to look like it\u2019s part of them but I know that from history and from cultural practices, gender based violence is not part of who we are as a people.\n\n\u201cThis is something that has been tolerated and has been seen in the last couple of years as normal. We have seen imprisoned voices wanting to change the lies because the types of violence has astronomically increased across the sexes not just women,\u201d she said.\n\nGado emphasised that though women are major victims of GBV, both men and women suffer the scourge of violence\n\n\u201cGBV can happen to men and women but women are majorly affected and so need to be educated on how to identify what it is, to know what it is, what to prevent, and what to do in situations and to prevent themselves, their daughters and even their sons just as she stressed the need to catch children young in the campaign against GBV.\n\n\u201cIf a mother teaches the son that violence is not the way and the daughter that violence is not normal then they will grow up to not want to continue even if they grow up in an environment where that is prevalent.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we educate women, empower them with skills to be able defend themselves without being disrespectful or violent themselves because sometimes a woman may not know that verbal abuse is violence and that is why we are here to educate them,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother team member noted the high rate of GBV, urging citizens however not to stop speaking about it till it is totally eradicated just as she beckons on women to always lift each other up by lending a helping hand when necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman coordinator and only teacher at the camp, Hannatu Andrew, lauded the outreach move by the organisation, saying that the funds would a long way in impacting the lives of the beneficiaries and their families.\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "CNL: Splashing $1bn on Nigerian suppliers, service providers in ten years",
          "text": "Benjamin Umuteme writes on how Chevron Nigerian Limited has impacted Nigeria\u2019s economy since its operation in teh country.\n\nDecember 1, 2021, Chevron Nigeria Limited (\u201cCNL\u201d), operator of the joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, (\u201cNNPC\u201d) \u2013 \u201cNNPC/CNL JV\u201d \u2013 marked 60 years of its operations in Nigeria. It was on December 1, 1961 that Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of Gulf Corporation, was registered in Nigeria and obtained its first prospecting license. Gulf Oil Company is the precursor of CNL.\n\nImpacting lives\n\nFor 60 years, Chevron has made significant contributions in Nigeria, not only as one of the country\u2019s largest oil and gas producers, but also as one of its largest investors. Beyond its core oil and gas business, Chevron has made significant contributions to the socio-economic development of Nigeria for six decades. CNL operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the NNPC for its onshore and offshore assets in the Niger Delta region. Chevron also has extensive interests in multi-partner deepwater operations, the Escravos Gas-to-Liquids (\u201cEGTL\u201d) facility and the West African Gas Pipeline Company.\n\nChevron\u2019s partnership with the people and government of Nigeria creates positive economic ripple effects.\n\n\u201cOur long and deep commitment to Nigeria through our significant investments in the economy and social development of the country contribute significantly to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product,\u201d said Rick Kennedy, CNL\u2019s Chairman and Managing Director at a recent media parley.\n\nRecognition\n\nIn February 2018, at the Nigerian International Petroleum Summit (\u201cNIPS\u201d) in Abuja, CNL received an industry award as the highest contributor of domestic gas in Nigeria. Kennedy explained that \u201cCNL\u2019s gas strategy is to end routine gas flaring and build a profitable gas business through a portfolio of projects that fulfill the NNPC/CNL JV\u2019s Domestic Gas Supply Obligation (\u201cDGSO\u201d) and support the Nigerian Gas Master Plan and the National Gas Policy.\n\n\u201cWe continue to invest in our operations to improve environmental performance while working with industry to develop new innovations and best practices. CNL has reduced routine flaring by over 95% in the past 10 years and has remained a pioneer and top supplier of on-spec gas, while maximizing supply into the Nigerian domestic market. CNL works very closely with its joint venture partner (NNPC), pertinent government agencies and industry stakeholders to advance domestic gas supply. Very notable are the Gas Sale and Aggregation Agreements (\u201cGSAAs\u201d) with Egbin Power Plc, Dangote Fertilizer Limited, and Olorunsogo Generation Company Limited.\u201d\n\nRick further said the Escravos Gas Project (\u201cEGP\u201d), and gas gathering, and processing facilities invested in by the NNPC/CNL JV, placed CNL as one of the pioneers in creating a practical and economic solution for gas flaring in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cEGTL enhances diversification and commercialization of gas resources and continues to provide great value to Nigeria through its high-quality products.\u201d he further highlighted.\n\nOn lower carbon\n\nThe CNL boss also revealed that \u201cChevron is taking actions globally to create a lower-carbon future by reducing the carbon intensity of our operations and assets, increasing the use of renewables and offsets, and investing in low-carbon technologies.\n\n\u201cChevron is supportive of Nigeria\u2019s commitment towards energy transition with special focus on both clean energy technologies and natural gas. Hence, we support the Decade of Gas initiatives lead by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and other important steps towards reforms in the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nLocal Content\n\nChevron has had a long history of commitment to Nigerian Content development. Chevron companies in Nigeria had developed and imbibed the Local/Nigerian Content development philosophy well before the April 2010 enactment of the Nigeran Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (\u201cNOGICD Act\u201d). Chevron has helped in building the capacities of several Nigerian businesses by providing training, contracts and procurement opportunities to Nigerians on all projects in our operations.\n\nFor the last 10 years, CNL has spent an estimated annual average of $1 billion on Nigerian suppliers and service providers. CNL\u2019s MD emphasizes that \u201cChevron does all this, not because we are compelled to, but because it is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nChevron\u2019s Agbami project set industry standards by fabricating more than 10,000 tonnes of steel with Nigerian fabrication companies, the highest ever recorded in Nigeria. Chevron also trained 105 Nigerian engineers from 21 engineering companies in South Korea. The Escravos Gas Project (EGP) has employed over 1,800 Nigerians and sourced millions of Dollars\u2019 worth of services (engineering, procurement, fabrication, marine, etc.) locally. Similarly, the EGTL project provided employment to more than 15,000 Nigerians during the construction phase of the project. In addition, the project awarded huge sub-contracts to local community contractors, sent 234 Nigerians on a 30-month training program in South Africa at the synthetic fuel facilities of Sasol Limited and trained over 7,000 Nigerians in technical skill crafts, plant operation and maintenance, business and project management, logistics and supply chain management, as well as gas tungsten arc welding processes.\n\nSocial investments\n\nRick also espoused Chevron\u2019s giant strides in social investments in communities where the company operates and elsewhere in Nigeria. \u201cChevron companies in Nigeria recognize that their business success is linked to society\u2019s progress. That explains why Chevron works with the communities, government, and other partners to support strategic social investments in health, education and economic development, and other focus areas such as the environment and sports development. As part of the company\u2019s forward-thinking approach, in 2005, the NNPC/CNL JV, partnered with others to pioneer the Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) participatory partnership model for community driven development,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe emphasized, that in the past 16 years, the NNPC/CNL JV has spent billions of naira in funding the GMoU and the model has recorded significant achievements, especially in areas of education, health, economic development and capacity building. Through the GMoU, the communities, represented by the different Regional Development Committees (\u201cRDCs\u201d) have executed a wide range of community development projects in the communities neighboring CNL\u2019s operations. In addition to hundreds of infrastructure projects implemented through the GMoU, it has helped to reduce potentials for conflicts, enhanced peace-building process, and human capital development \u2013 which are helping to sustain wealth creation in communities around CNL\u2019s areas of operations.\u201d\n\nAs part of the GMoU, CNL established the Participatory Partnership for Community Development (PPCD), which has built the capacity of the Non-Governmental Organizations, community leaders and the people through various programmes.\n\nHealth/education\n\nThe NNPC/CNL JV has embarked on several health projects and programmes in the past 60 years both in the communities and other parts of Nigeria. In 2002, CNL launched the River Boat Clinic to serve the health needs of communities in the western Niger Delta. Over three-quarter of a million people benefitted from the healthcare programme before it was discontinued in 2020.\n\nCNL also built and donated a DNA Molecular laboratory to the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital, and the facility is very significant to medical research in Nigeria. The NNPC/CNL JV also recently donated a Polymerase Chain Reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) laboratory to Warri Central Hospital to support the Delta State government in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to other industry-collaborations.\n\nFurthermore, CNL is also committed to the fight against malaria through initiatives such as the Roll Back Malaria programmes, Malaria in Pregnancy, Training of health workers, distribution of Intermittent Preventive Treatment and Artemisinin-based drugs, and Long-Lasting Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets. Over 46,000 people have benefitted from the malaria prevention education and/or treatment since 2014.\n\nChevron, the largest contributor to Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB since January 2008, has also supported Global Fund with a total investment of US$60 million in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. In Nigeria, Chevron\u2019s partnership has contributed to helping more than a million people living with HIV access lifesaving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nIn the area of education, the CNL is supporting development of education in the Niger Delta region and across the country through development of education infrastructure, capacity building and scholarships. The scholarships include: the NNPC/CNL JV national university scholarship and the community scholarship program which caters for students in both secondary and tertiary institutions from communities in CNL\u2019s areas of operations. Additionally, CNL awards scholarships to visually impaired students to enhance their access to quality education. Over 23,000 people have benefitted from the company\u2019s scholarship programs which include scholarship for community postgraduates\u2019 scholars in Nigeria and foreign universities.\n\nSince inception of the Agbami Medical and Engineering Professional Scholarship programme in 2009, over 16,500 students from all the states of Nigeria have benefitted from the scholarship, out of which 715 students have graduated with first class degrees. Chevron and its Deepwater parties have continued to invest in education infrastructure. As at today, the parties have executed 39 Science laboratory complexes and 25 conventional and hybrid libraries across the country. Also, Chevron and its partners embark on a wide range of activities to encourage students to develop interest in key subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (\u201cSTEM\u201d) and, ultimately pursue STEM courses and career.\n\nPoverty\n\nOn poverty, the CNL boss said the company launched the United States-based NDPI and its Nigerian counterpart, PIND in 2010 to develop and implement interventions aimed at sustainably reducing conflict and poverty in Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta region through multi-stakeholder partnerships. The Foundations were started with an initial US$50 million investment in 2010, with Chevron committing an additional US$40 million in funding to NDPI and PIND from 2014 through 2019, and a further US$25 million in 2020 for a third, five-year phase through 2024\n\nProspects of oil&gas business\n\nOn the whole, the CNL expressed optimism on the future of the oil and gas business in Nigeria as the opportunities are enormous.\u201cChevron takes a long-term view of Nigeria. The company has been making significant investments in the country for 60 years and it expects to do so for many more years to come. With the right policies, laws and regulations, the enormous potential of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector can yield even greater benefits for all,\u201d Rick assured.",

          "title": "Canada Advises Against International Travel Amid Omicron Threat",
          "text": "Canada\u2019s government implored residents on Wednesday not to leave the country as provinces ramp up vaccinations to combat the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant, even as efforts to head off a COVID-19 wave are complicated by public fatigue over the pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 case numbers are increasing as Canadian hospitals struggle to clear backlogs from months of postponed procedures. Many exhausted staff members appear ill-equipped for another surge in infections.\n\n\u201cI say very clearly: Now is not the time to travel,\u201d Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos told a news conference, adding it is clear there is community transmission of Omicron in Canada.\n\nDuclos said the government is sending millions more COVID-19 vaccine doses and rapid tests to the 10 provinces.\n\nOntario is broadening the eligibility for a third shot of the vaccine to everyone over the age of 18, while shortening the required gap between the second and third doses to three months.\n\n\u201cAs we combat the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, nothing matters more than getting these booster doses into people\u2019s arms,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Wednesday.\n\nCanada\u2019s most-populous province also announced a capacity restriction of 50% for indoor events with a capacity of at least 1,000, including sports activities, concerts and commercial film and television production.\n\nCanada already has travel bans on 10 African countries because of concerns about the new variant. Canada advised people in March 2020 not to travel abroad unless necessary. But it withdrew the notice this past October \u2013 before the first Omicron cases were reported \u2013 citing the success of vaccination campaigns.\n\nPeter Juni, director of Ontario\u2019s COVID-19 science advisory table, urged people to take precautions, get vaccinated and not take Omicron lightly.\n\n\u201cWhat really worries me is that people are asleep at the steering wheel, internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have wishful thinking it will be mild. \u2026 This is not a realistic attitude.\u201d\n\nScientists suspect Omicron is more transmissible given its rapid spread, although they caution it is too early to draw conclusions about its severity. read more\n\n\u2018MASSIVE VULNERABILITY\u2019\n\nThere is \u201cmassive vulnerability\u201d in Canada\u2019s healthcare systems, said Andrew Morris, an infectious disease doctor in Toronto, who added it is \u201chighly likely\u201d they will be overwhelmed.\n\nThe intensive care unit that Dr. Christie Lee oversees at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto secured some breathing room following the last COVID-19 wave, tried to give staff vacation time and was able to train new critical-care nurses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told to prepare, potentially, for rapidly increasing cases,\u201d Lee said.\n\nIn Alberta, a western Canadian province that experienced a punishing fourth wave, Dr. Christopher Doig\u2019s ICU in Calgary still has COVID-19 patients, some of whom have been there for weeks. It is still operating at about 110% capacity, Doig said.\n\nShifting staff from other areas lets them \u201csurge up\u201d if needed, Doig said. \u201cThe downside of those surges is it pulls staff from other areas,\u201d and the pandemic backlog of surgeries grows.\n\nHealth officials are trying to persuade the public to get third doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Provinces including Manitoba have expanded booster eligibility to everyone 18 and older. A number of other provinces have been rolling them out more slowly, targeting older or more medically vulnerable people first.\n\nAmid fears of asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission, provinces that were given millions of rapid antigen tests by the federal government have come under fire for not distributing them more widely.\n\nOntario promised to make 2 million tests available in \u201chigh-traffic\u201d areas and to allot five per student to school children this week. Quebec will hand out five tests per person starting next week. Alberta promised to give out 500,000 starting on Friday.\n\nBritish Columbia health officials said this week they had not received the tests they were hoping for from the federal government and defended the province\u2019s providing tens of thousands of rapid tests a week to hundreds of private employers.\n\nAlberta loosened restrictions on private gatherings on Wednesday, with Premier Jason Kenney citing pandemic fatigue.\n\nOntario said this week it is \u201ctemporarily interrupting\u201d its return-to-office plan for provincial employees\n\nJuni said he understands that people are tired of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m done completely. But the virus doesn\u2019t care.\u201d",

          "title": "Barcelona Striker Aguero Retires at 33 Due to Heart Condition",
          "text": "Barcelona and Argentina striker Sergio Aguero broke down in tears as he announced his retirement from football on Wednesday due to a heart condition, bringing the curtain down on an 18-year career during which he scored more than 400 goals.\n\nAguero, 33, was taken to hospital on Oct. 30 after experiencing chest pain and breathing difficulties in Barcelona\u2019s 1-1 draw with Alaves.\n\nThe club announced a few days later that he would be out for at least three months following cardiac analysis before doctors advised him not to play again.\n\n\u201cThis press conference is to communicate that I\u2019ve decided to stop playing soccer. It\u2019s a very hard moment but I\u2019m at peace with the decision I made,\u201d Aguero told a gathering at the Camp Nou.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that I made to preserve my health. It\u2019s what the doctors said to me, that it would be better to stop playing. I made the decision around 10 days ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my career, it was a dream come true. I just wanted to be a professional player and never thought that I would play in Europe.\u201d\n\nAguero moved to Spain prior to this season after a decade with Premier League champions Manchester City, where he scored 260 goals in 390 appearances to become the club\u2019s record goalscorer.\n\nHe famously scored an stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers in 2012 to secure a first top flight league title for City since 1968, to which he added four more Premier League trophies, one FA Cup and six League Cups.\n\nHaving heard of his impending retirement, City fans paid tribute on Tuesday when they chanted Aguero\u2019s name during their 7-0 thrashing of Leeds United.\n\nHe also scored 41 goals in 101 games for Argentina, representing them at three World Cups and helping them win the 2021 Copa America \u2014 their first major title in 28 years.\n\n\u2018IT HURTS\u2019\n\nThe Argentine joined Barca on a free transfer during the close season, but made only five appearances in all competitions due to a calf injury and his cardiac issues.\n\n\u201cThe first weeks (after the diagnosis) were really hard. When I took the first physical tests after the incident\u2026 the doctors told me that there was a big possibility I could not play again,\u201d Aguero added.\n\n\u201cSo I started to process it, that I could never play professional football again. When they gave me the definite diagnosis, I was prepared. It hurts, of course, it was a really difficult process to go through, but I\u2019m good now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m positive about it\u2026 That I can live my life happy after professional football, that nothing more serious happened. Now I can live a normal life and do other things with my family as a regular guy.\u201d\n\nThe gathering included Barcelona coach Xavi, City coach Pep Guardiola, Aguero\u2019s team mates, club president Joan Laporta and several football officials from Spain, where Aguero also played for Atletico Madrid \u2014 the club where he announced himself in Europe with 100 goals.\n\nAguero scored only one goal for Barcelona which came in a 2-1 home defeat by Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cNot bad for a last goal, is it,\u201d he said which elicited laughter from those present despite the sombre occasion.\n\n\u201cWinning the Europa League with Atletico was a really happy moment and then obviously with City the goal I scored to win the first Premier League. For me and City, it was a beautiful moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot (of memorable moments) and the last was the Copa America. I only played two or three matches, but it was something that we had been looking to win for years and years.\u201d",
