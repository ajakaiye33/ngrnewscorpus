          "text": "A senior commander of the Iranian Guards said on Wednesday that the killing of all American leaders would not be enough to avenge the United States assassination of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards\u2019 top commander Qassem Soleimani two years ago.\n\nRevolutionary Guard Mohammad Pakpour was quoted as saying by Iranian state media, \u201cMartyr Soleimani was such a great character that, if all American leaders are killed, this would still not avenge his assassination.\n\n\u201cWe should avenge him by following Soleimani\u2019s path and through other methods,\u2019\u2019 he charged.\n\nThe United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Soleimani\u2019s killing in a US drone attack at Baghdad airport and Tehran\u2019s retaliation by attacking US bases in Iraq.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said Soleimani was targeted for plotting future attacks on US interests and that he had in the past, helped coordinate strikes against American forces in Iraq, through militia proxies.\n\nPakpour\u2019s comments came days after US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he did not support removing Iran\u2019s Quds Force, an arm of its Revolutionary Guards, from a list of foreign terrorist organizations, as demanded by Tehran for the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nTrump abandoned the deal under which Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international financial sanctions, and Iran responded by violating its limits.\n\nPresident Joe Biden however said he aimed to restore it.\n\nAlmost a year of indirect talks between Iran and the United States have stalled since March as both Tehran and Washington blame each other for failing to settle remaining issues.\n\nOne of the unresolved questions was whether the US would remove Iran\u2019s Guards from the terrorist list.\n\nWashington has been considering removing the IRGC from its foreign terrorist organization blacklist in return for Iranian assurances about reining in the elite force\u2019s influence in the Middle East.\n\nCritics of dropping the IRGC from the list, as well as those open to the idea, said doing so would have little economic effect because other US sanctions force foreign actors to shun the group.\n\nIran\u2019s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Tuesday that his country\u2019s future should not be tied to the success or collapse of nuclear talks with world powers.\n\nNAN",

Those who understand the language of the economy, those who understand the language of money and can manage resources, as well as those who have experience in the private and public sector.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigeria would be in for better times if selfless people with capacity are given the opportunity to rule, adding that as national lawmakers, he believes the senators understand why the dignity of a nation with over 200million people should be entrusted into the hands of those who understand economic issues.\n\nEarlier, Senator Chris Ekpenyong on behalf of Senators from Akwa Ibom, who were all present, eulogized Governor Emmanuel for changing the fortunes of Akwa Ibomites.\n\n\u201cBefore 2015, we in Akwa Ibom could not sleep with our two eyes closed. But Governor Emmanuel restored peace, provided job opportunities and engaged youths in meaningful activities thereby reducing criminal activities and restiveness.\n\nEkpenyong narrated that on different occasions, the Governor had hosted the Vice President and the Senate President to commission Industries, health care facilities and roads infrastructure, thereby making other political parties are attest to his achievements.\n\nA former deputy Governor of Ekiti State, Senator Abiodun Olujimi maintained that Governor Emmanuel has been one of the strong pillars behind the success of the PDP.\n\nShe maintained that the Governor has related well with the National Assembly members and could be a perfect bridge builder to unite the country.\n\n\u201cYou believe in this country, and you believe in our party as a binding force and vehicle, and we in the senate will be of immense support with whatever we can do to make our country grow.\u201d\n\nAt the home of Honourable Ndudi Elumelu, the Minority Leader of he House of Representatives, the lawmakers while eulogizing Governor Emmanuel, took turns to lobby for the extension of Ibom Air services to their respective states.\n\n\u201cI learnt the airline recently started flying to Yenogoa, Bayelsa State, there is no reason it should not be in Asaba(Delta State)\u201d, Elumelu said, before being interjected by other lawmakers who advocated for their respective States in unison.\n\n\u201cI have not seen an airline so disciplined and efficient in Nigeria. On two occasions, I have missed my flight, because of their strict adherence to time. On the last occasion, I saw the door of the aircraft being shut and the plane taxied off before I could make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes a man that is focused to build up such a system. Today if you go online to buy Ibom Air Ticket, you would hardly find because it always fully booked. You have done very well to our people, to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYou have always had high regards for the National Assembly, and I believe they are all happy with you\u201d, Hon. Elumelu added.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel was asked to take a bow, while the lawmakers applauded him.\n\nThe Governor was accompanied by several Akwa Ibom PDP stakeholders who had earlier in the day accompanied the Preferred Candidate for the State\u2019s Governorship race, Pastor Umo Eno to submit his nomination forms at the PDP National Secretariat.\n\nAmong members of the delegation were Pastor Umo Eno, the preferred Candidate of the PDP on the forthcoming Governorship elections,\n\nBarr Emmanuel Enoidem, the International Chairman of the MPM, Campaign DG, Chief Assam Assam( SAN), deputy Director General of Campaigns, Dr. Godwin Ntukudeh, MPM Secretary, Prince Enobong Uwah, Senator Effiong Bob, Obong Paul Ekpo, the Etinan Federal Constituency aspirant, Commissioners Frank Archibong, Eno Ibanga and Ini Ememobong, and several other stakeholders, like Hon Okpolupm Etteh, Engr.

Powerful and rich owners of the houses had always frustrated past efforts to clean up the slum.\n\nIt is left to see if Soludo would succumb to them this time or move to clean up the slum and make it a better place to be. And no doubt, he would have massive support of the residents and greater number of Anambra people to make Okpoko a better place once and for all.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) has called on the Federal Government to drop its ego and accept the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) as a payment solution in all tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, COEASU President, Dr. Smart Olugbeko said the challenge created by the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) has been a great source of worry and constituted one of the major issues prone to industrial crisis in the College of Education (COE) system.\n\nAccording to him, IPPIS breaches the establishment integrity of the tertiary institutions system, undermines the statutory functions of the Governing Councils, and opens the payroll up to unilateral manipulations.\n\n\u201cThe intractable challenge created by the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) has been a great source of worry and constituted one of the major issues prone to industrial crisis in the College of Education (COE) system. IPPIS breaches the establishment integrity of the tertiary institutions system, undermines the statutory functions of the Governing Councils, and opens the payroll up to unilateral manipulations\n\n\u201cWithin a short time after its unilateral imposition on tertiary institutions by the FG in February 2020, academic Unions\u2019 opposition to it was vindicated as the IPPIS pay platform engendered several irregularities, such as salary omission, accommodation of ghost workers, mutilated salary, and inconsistency in payment of salary of staff on sabbatical and study leaves. The payment system also enables the FG to impose baseless deductions under the guise of a new tax regime shrouded in calculative mysteries at the detriment of our members.\u201d Olugbeko stated.\n\nThe union\u2019s President commended the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) for developing UTAS as an alternative to the controversial IPPIS.\n\nHe noted that the UTAS, being a home-grown and hack-proof payment system, addresses the union\u2019s concerns on payroll security and the peculiarities of the tertiary education system in general.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe further said audit findings show that despite the huge amount expended by the government in developing the IPPIS, it has not yet fully been developed thereby robbing FG of billions\n\n\u201cAll over the world, research is the fulcrum of the academic community where academics proffer solutions to problems and evolve templates for development.\n\nHe suggested that the UTAS be adopted for the entire tertiary education sector as it takes care of the peculiarities of the institutions including financial autonomy, sabbatical service, and the administration of discipline.\n\n\u201cThus, the Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) commends the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) for living up to its pedigree as a Union of intellectuals and eggheads as it came up with the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) as an alternative to the controversial IPPIS. UTAS, being a home-grown and hack-proof payment system, addresses our concerns on payroll security and the peculiarities of the tertiary education system in general. After due considerations, our Union, COEASU, does not only welcome UTAS, but also posits that UTAS should, indeed, be adopted for the entire tertiary education sector as it takes care of the peculiarities of the institutions including financial autonomy, sabbatical service, and the administration of discipline.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore thrown aback by the latest game of shear ego resorted to by the FG through the lazy and mischievous blackmail of UTAS because of unsubstantiated claims of inadequacy. The National Information Technology Development Agency\u2019s (NITDA) assessment of UTAS done between 8th and 16th of March 2022 which subjected it to 698 cases gave UTAS 97.4% and 99.3% before and after remediation respectively. This great feat is enough for FG to give kudos to ASUU for providing a home-grown solution to the problem of payment system in the country and quickly adopt it for payment, rather the FG resorted to blackmailing of ASUU and UTAS. Who is afraid of UTAS? The answer is simple, the beneficiaries who do not want UTAS, not because it is inadequate, but because it will reveal the holes in the operationalisation of IPPIS. Details of the audit findings submitted to the National Assembly in September 2021 by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (OAuGF) revealed how operators of the IPPIS connived with the consulting vendors and operators to defraud the government. The report further revealed that despite the huge amount expended by government in developing the platform, it has not yet fully been developed thereby robbing FG of billions and yet FG is comfortable with.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we hereby call on the Federal Government to drop its ego, accept UTAS as a payment solution in all tertiary institutions in Nigeria whose functions and structure are different from the mainstream ministries.\u201d He said.",

This is even as he said Nigeria was quite experienced in electoral matters and had introduced some reforms in the electoral process.\n\nKubwimana said t the UN would always assist African countries in strengthening electoral processes in order to deepen democracy.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

          "text": "\u2022This year budget now projected to have deficit of N7.35 trillion\n\nGilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock was expected to hit N45.86 trillion by December 2022.\n\nAccording to the President, LCCI, Mr. Michael Olawale-Cole, who spoke at a press briefing on the state of the nation, the country\u2019s debt stock was expected to increase following the federal government\u2019s plan to borrow an additional N1.6 trillion, while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing was pegged at N2.57 trillion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is also a plan to borrow N2.57 trillion from foreign creditors, while N1.16 trillion is expected from multilateral/bilateral drawdowns.\n\n\u201cIn total, the federal government plans to add N6.3 trillion new debts to the current debt stock, which would push the country\u2019s total debt stock to N45.86 trillion by December 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nThe LCCI boss noted that the 2022 federal government budget was now projected to have a deficit of N7.35 trillion from the approved N6.26trillion if the recent request for an additional deficit of N965.4billion by the president presented to the National Assembly was granted, explaining that in total, adding that with the new debts, the country was likely to have a higher debt service-to-revenue ratio if revenue levels do not increase significantly.\n\nFurthermore, he predicted tougher times ahead for the manufacturing sector of the economy going into the second quarter of the year, predicting that manufacturing concerns would likely suffer due to poor public infrastructure, and port-related challenges as these may continue to present as headwinds to the sector\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, with the war in Ukraine aggravating disruptions to supply chains of raw materials like wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflower, and corn, the rising cost of production may not abate soon,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the power sector, he said it was becoming clearer that the national grid cannot supply sufficient power to meet the nation\u2019s electricity demand, lamenting that on the back of the epileptic power supply, businesses have had to deal with the rising cost of manufacturing, exorbitant logistics, and constrained production.\n\nHe added that with the cost of diesel at record levels and persisting poor power supply, businesses had been running on unsustainable costs and producing at uncompetitive prices.\n\nHe warned that the situation could lead to job losses as output is constrained due to the unbearable cost of production.\n\n\u201cIf not quickly tackled, these challenges will likely subdue the GDP growth potentials and projections for 2022,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe LCCI boss added: \u201cThe government should create funding for critical infrastructure and special purpose intervention in the power sector. The newly launched Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infracorp) has a mandate to focus on power, renewables, transport, and logistics. The InfraCorp will succeed in mobilizsng private sector participation if we can achieve cost-reflective pricing in the power sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe gas-to-power infrastructure requires an overhaul to resolve the persisting gas shortage. However, the most sustainable solution to Nigeria\u2019s power shortages is the transition to renewable energy,\u201d he advised.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Kukah said Nigeria needed urgent measures to salvage it, especially in the face of an alarming spate of insecurity.\n\nThe Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), in its reaction to the worsening security situation, advised Buhari to \u201cimmediately\u201d resign from office.\n\nAmid the widespread mood of resentment and anger in the country, at least 23 persons were yet again killed on Monday in Benue State, when assailants believed to be herders attacked two communities in the state.\n\nSome bloodthirsty terrorists had at the weekend killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others after an invasion of communities in Plateau State. The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that, unfortunately, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nHowever, the president in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, directed that the perpetrators of the dastardly acts should not be spared or forgiven. The president ordered the law enforcement agencies to work actively with the Plateau State government to bring the situation under control and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nBuhari expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks, saying as a matter of priority, peace must return at all costs to the state and the entire country.\n\nThe president urged, \u201cOur citizens, the people of Plateau State, in particular, to expose the perpetrators of such incidents, their sponsors and those who encourage such criminals who carry out these dastardly acts of murder, so that the law will take its course.\u201d\n\nHe added that the criminals \u201cmust not be forgiven\u201d.\n\nA statement in Jos by Dadu\u2019ut urged the federal government to expeditiously apprehend the perpetrators of the Plateau killings and bring them to justice. She also called on the federal government to put machineries in place that would ensure that criminals do not escape arrest and prosecution.\n\nDadu\u2019ut said, \u201cI condole with the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, the Senator representing Plateau Central, and the people of the local government council over the sad incident.\u201d\n\nDimka also commiserated with the affected communities. He said he recently paid a condolence visit to the Executive Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, Dr. Dayyabu Garga, over the killings and wanton destruction of property. Describing the act as disheartening, sad, and unfortunate, he reiterated his appeal to the federal Government to come to the rescue of the state.\n\nThe senator called on the security agencies to intensify efforts to expose the masterminds of the killings and bring them to book as a deterrent to others.\n\nDimka said, \u201cI wish to most heartily, on behalf of the people of Plateau Central, condemn these dastardly acts of taking the lives of innocent people and destruction of property and to console the families of those who have lost their loved ones in the course of these senseless attacks.\u201d\n\nDimka said he was touched by the barbaric act perpetrated by the bandits, who used the land donated to the state government for ranching at Garga to infiltrate the communities that were attacked last Sunday.\n\nThe senator was reported to have donated bags of millet, sugar, salt and maggi as his contribution to efforts to alleviate the suffering of the affected communities.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 23 locals were killed on Monday night in Benue State, when suspected armed herders attacked their communities. The attacks occurred on at Mbadwem and Tiortyu communities in Guma and Tiortyu local government areas, respectively, state authorities said.\n\nChief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Nathaniel Ikyur, confirmed the killings, in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nOrtom condemned the killings and asked the people of the state to rise and defend themselves.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cIt is becoming increasingly glaring every day that my people are now an endangered species and so we can no longer wait for help from anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe was also quoted as saying in the statement, \u201cMy people will have to rise up to the occasion to defend themselves and their heritage against the Fulani army of occupation.\u201d\n\nApart from the killings, the governor\u2019s aide said scores of others were injured and had been taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nDuring the attack on Mbadwem, no fewer than eight people were reported killed, while 15 people lost their lives in Tiortyu.\n\nOrtom lamented, \u201cWe are law-abiding citizens; we have cried for help against these invaders, but nothing is forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe are left alone, and it looks like it is a deliberate strategy.\n\n\u201cNow we have only one option: to defend ourselves or get extinct. This is a case for our survival. We have been accommodating of other people in our land, but our hospitality is misconstrued as weakness. We are not a conquered people. We will never be. We are free-born citizens of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe governor called on the security agencies to do more in crime prevention and protect the lives and property of the people in the state. He also urged the residents to cooperate with security agencies to flush out the undesirable elements in the society.\n\nThe state government, Ortom said, will not shy away from its commitment to providing welfare and security for its people.\n\nInsecurity: Nigeria on the Verge of Collapse, Says Kukah\n\nKukah expressed concern over what he called abandonment of Nigerians to their fate in the face of terrifying insecurity.\n\nThe Bishop said, \u201cNigerians are like orphans in the face of this difficult situation with nobody to console them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after the Chrism Mass at the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral, Sokoto, yesterday, Kukah said Nigeria was in a war situation, even though the authorities were not willing to admit that. He explained that the situation in Nigeria was inexplicable, stressing that Nigerians have since placed their fate, belief, and hope in God to bring about the needed change in the country.\n\nThe clergyman also expressed worry over the activities of fraudulent individuals using religion to compound the woes of citizens by subjecting them to all forms of manipulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe scripture has told us very clearly that there is nothing that is happening to us now that is new, that hasn\u2019t happened before, there is nothing that is new.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the idea of spirituality in any religion was to provide man with moral anchor, saying, \u201cReligion doesn\u2019t make the problem go away and I am saying, for me in the Catholic Church, we have no discount.\u201d\n\nKukah added, \u201cWe are in a very dangerous time when many people and fraudsters are using the message of Christ in a way and manner that may suite the challenges of the moment.\u201d\n\nIn another development a resident of Isa local government of Sokoto State, Musa Abdullahi, said it would take the grace of God to eradicate banditry in the region.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, these people have succeeded by recruiting informants, who tell them the movement of security agencies,\u201d Abdullahi added.\n\nHe stated that the insecurity in the North-west had political undertone, stressing that the terrorists are living among the people, \u201cbut nobody is willing to expose them.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that the hands of security agencies were tied due to the law of engagement.\n\nNorthern Elders Call for Buhari\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF), in a statement signed by its media chief, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, called for the president\u2019s resignation due to the high level of insecurity in the country.\n\nNEF stated, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration does not appear to have answers to the security challenges that we face.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to live and die under the dictates of assassins, kidnappers, rapists, and other criminal organisations who have robbed us of our right to live in peace and security.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for President Buhari to seriously consider that option, given his leadership\u2019s spectacular inability to provide security to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOur Forum recognises the importance of this advice and recognises that we cannot continue to live in these conditions until President Buhari\u2019s term ends in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed dissatisfaction with the incessant killings and attacks almost on a daily basis.\n\nIt said, \u201cKillers and other criminals appear to have detected a paralysing vacuum at the highest levels of government, and they have grown more confident and competent in subverting the state and our security.\n\n\u201cNigerians have shed enough tears and blood without receiving adequate protection from those who are supposed to protect us.\u201d\n\nThe forum advised Nigerians to exercise extreme caution when electing their leaders in the upcoming elections, saying the country urgently requires good leaders to lead it back to prosperity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Adjusts Fiscal Framework\n\n\u2022To raise crude oil benchmark to $73 per barrel\n\n\u2022Demands additional N182.45bn for Police\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade\n\n\n\nThe Senate yesterday received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari to approve adjustments in the 2022 fiscal framework, including to raise the amount the federal government would expend on fuel subsidy this year to N4 trillion.\n\nPrecisely, the president sought the chamber to approve an increase in the estimated provision for PMS subsidy for 2022 by N3.557 trillion, from N442.72 billion to N4.00 trillion.\n\nThe increase in payment for the contentious subsidy on petrol in 2022 followed the decision of the government in January to extend the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by 18 months after the labour unions and civil society organisations threatened showdown with the government.\n\nThe request for approval to adjust the 2022 fiscal framework, was contained in a letter dated April 5, 2022, read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter, explained that an adjustment to the 2022 became imperative in view of new developments in both the global and domestic economies.\n\nAccording to him, the developments were occasioned by spikes in the market price of crude oil, which were a fallout of the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, there have been new developments both in the global economy as well as in the domestic economy which have necessitated the revision of the 2022 Fiscal Framework on which the 2022 Budget was based.\n\n\u201cThese developments include spikes in the market price of crude oil, aggravated by the Russian-Ukraine war, significantly lower oil production volume due principally to production shut-ins as a result of massive theft of crude oil between the production platforms and the terminals.\n\n\u201cThe decision to suspend the removal of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy at a time when high crude oil prices have elevated the subsidy cost has significantly eroded government revenues,\u201d a statement quoted the president to have said.\n\nHe, therefore, requested the upper chamber to approve an increase in the oil benchmark by $11 per barrel, from $62 per barrel to $73 per barrel.\n\nThe president also sought a reduction in the projected oil production volume by 283,000 barrels per day, from 1.883 million barrels per day to 1.600 million barrels per day.\n\nPresident Buhari, underscored the need to cut the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion, from N352.80 billion to N152.80 billion.\n\nHe also proposed an increase in the projection for the federal government\u2019s independent revenue by N400 billion; and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nHe added that, \u201cbased on the above adjustments, the Federation Account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.418 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account (net of transfer to the Federal Capital Territory and other statutory deductions) is projected to reduce by N1.173 trillion.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the amount available to fund the FGN budget was projected to decline by N772.91 billion due to the increase in the projection for Independent Revenue (Operating Surplus Remittance) by N400 billion.\n\nThe president further explained that aggregate expenditure was projected to increase by N192.52 billion, due to increase in personnel cost by N161.40 billion and other service wide votes by N21.05 billion (both for the Nigeria Police Force), additional domestic debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nGiving a breakdown, he said the net deductions would see a cut by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC); NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe president noted that the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry because of insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought. In addition to public sector initiatives, startups have been built to solve some of the sector\u2019s problems.\n\nKatapult Africa is a venture capital firm focused on startups building solutions for agriculture, food, and the climate. Founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad, the firm has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly.\n\nAbbey Wemimo and Samir Goel founded Esusu to help immigrants access credit and build up a credit score. Betterfly, on the other hand, allows employers to incentivise their employees to maintain healthy habits.\n\nIn 2018, the firm started investing in African startups and has 17 startups in its portfolio. Techpoint Africa spoke to Katapult\u2019s Rwandan Country Director, Philip Gasaatura, who shared the firm\u2019s startup investment criteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get into VC?\n\nI have a computer science and tech background, so I did some years in investment banking in the UK. I was mostly on the trading floors but then shifted more into entrepreneurship and then moved to ventures here in Africa. That led me more into the VC space because I knocked on a couple of doors.\n\nThat didn\u2019t go too well, which led me to work with the Rwandan government, where I advised on their innovation fund \u2014 the Rwanda Innovation Fund \u2014 and helped to structure it with the general partners. My role was advising the government on the structuring and LP agreements with the fund manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat went live and brought me into Katapult Africa, which was looking into setting up operations in Africa. Tharald Nustad, a tech entrepreneur, started Katapult, and it is both an accelerator and a VC fund, so we write checks for the companies that go through our cohort.\n\nWe started in 2016, and we have 108 companies in our portfolio. The two verticals have been mainly climate and ocean. The new one is Katapult Africa because we see opportunity on the continent, and we\u2019ve had some success stories along the way.\n\nSeventeen of the 108 companies in our portfolio are based in Africa, and last month, two companies \u2014 Betterfly in North America and Nigerian-founded, US-based Esusu \u2014 announced their unicorn status.\n\nWhen did Katapult start investing in Africa?\n\nThe first of our cohorts was back in 2019 with the likes of FinAccess in Kenya and RxAll; we also got Sky Garden.\n\nAre there industries that Katapult focuses on, or are you sector agnostic?\n\nOur cohorts in Oslo [Norway] have been mainly focused on climate and the ocean, focusing on those companies that can scale and have an effect on people, the planet, and profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSky.Garden was one of Katapult Africa\u2019s first investments.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at the scale at which these companies can grow. We are working with support from our partners, and we\u2019ve got partnerships with Smart Africa, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, and Norrsken. We\u2019re looking broadly at Agritech, food, and climate and are open to other startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you invest at specific stages or all stages?\n\nTypically, we invest between $100,00 and $150,000 for between 6 and 8% equity at the pre-seed or seed stage. That\u2019s our sweet spot, and we like companies with a good team that are post-revenue, have attained product-market fit, and want to scale. We also have a bias for companies that execute quickly.\n\nWhat startups have been your biggest successes and failures?\n\nGlobally, some of our successes include Esusu and Betterfly in North America. They recently attained unicorn status, and we\u2019re excited about that because they came through our programme in Oslo. In Africa, two of our companies \u2014 FinAccess and Sky Garden \u2014 are raising their Series A.\n\nHow do you deal with investments that don\u2019t go according to plan?\n\nWe do what every other investor does; we lick our wounds. Some investments fail because of the entrepreneur, while some fail because of the environment. Here in Africa, the challenges that entrepreneurs face may stop them from achieving their milestones, so they run out of cash or fold. This is why rather than go out to invest one by one, we do it in a cohort to improve the chances of our investments succeeding.\n\nHow will you advise a founder to prepare their startup for investments?\n\nThe investment is not the ultimate thing. Are you building a business that your customers want or like? The focus, I think, should be on product-market fit. There\u2019s always the temptation to scale before getting your product-market fit, and that\u2019s premature.\n\nIf companies understand their customer\u2019s needs, the capital will follow. That\u2019s critical. How companies grow their customer base is also essential. Are they growing week-on-week? How do they fix hitting a plateau? Those are important things in growing a solid business with a solid foundation and capital flows to such companies.\n\nHow do you ensure a steady stream of quality startups?\n\nWe believe in investing for scale and impact, and we can\u2019t do that independently. And this is why we have developed partnerships with TBI, Norrsken, and Smart Africa. We\u2019re also building with others across the region who were here before us.\n\nWe\u2019re aware that Africa is a different market, and we\u2019re learning from our relationships with different partners in the markets we\u2019re looking to operate in. These partnerships help us to understand the lay of the land while we can share and access deal flow. It\u2019s a journey, and we\u2019re aware that we don\u2019t know it all, but we\u2019re excited to learn along the way.\n\nWhat are the biggest mistakes you\u2019ve seen startups make?\n\nPremature scaling is one, and I mean scaling before hitting product-market fit in your home country. There\u2019s often the idea that my home country is not big enough, hence the need to scale quickly. An example is getting 1,000 visits to your app or website, but only 2% (2) stay. Many founders will ask how they can get more people to come in, but you should be asking, \u201cHow can I get 60% or 80% to stay?\u201d\n\nSo fixing those kinds of issues before getting to that scale is vital. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest challenges because VC money should be coming to add fuel to the fire. You already have something, and it\u2019s just coming to help scale growth, not necessarily helping you get product-market fit.\n\nThe second one and I think it\u2019s a big one, is the composition of your founding team. You need to build around a team and not an individual. A team will get you across many lines going forward, and investors like to invest in good teams. The product can always pivot, but the team is the key to that.\n\nWhat are the specific qualities you look for in a team?\n\nOne of the qualities we look out for is a team that understands the problem. When you look at a team\u2019s construct, there\u2019s someone handling the technical aspects and someone knocking on doors, getting the sales, getting the customers, and doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWho\u2019s helping to do the scaling after you\u2019ve gained territory? Who\u2019s creating the processes and the systems? One of the things you realise in the likes of Coca-Cola, Google, and others is that once the founding team has built the product or the company, they\u2019re not necessarily the team that will scale it and get into other countries.\n\nYou need to understand where each company needs help and who to bring in at the right time. I like to use the guys at Google [as an example]; they brought in Eric Schmidt because they were conscious of what they did not know. So who are the members of the founding team, and who do they bring in to support them through their early phases?\n\nHow can startups that are looking for investment reach you?\n\nWe are currently receiving applications on our website. There\u2019s a section where they can apply for the Africa programme, and we\u2019re always looking at applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAllegations against Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nNenne Nwodo\u2019s dream at age 6\n\nNCC\u2019s warning on NIN-SIM linkage\n\nPylon\u2019s $19 million seed funding\n\nFlutterwave CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, faces allegations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Hundeyin, journalist and founder of West Africa Weekly newsletter, stated in a tweet on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, that he began working on a story about the Nigerian payment company, Flutterwave, six months ago.\n\nThe story has gone viral, dominating Twitter roundtable discussions.\n\nWhat exactly is the story? According to the article, which he claims contains the necessary proof to back up his claims, Hundeyin accuses Flutterwave CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, of bullying and committing some crimes. These include insider trading, and inflating and deflating stock prices as desired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said that Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola illegally exploited the assets, information, and contacts of Access Bank, where he worked.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t make those up. You can catch up with the story here: Flutterwave: The African Unicorn Built On Quicksand\n\nThis story is coming after Clara Wanjiku, an ex-employee of Flutterwave, published a Medium post on Monday, April 4, 2022, criticising the CEO for \u201c5 years of constant harassment.\u201d\n\nThe company, which was founded in 2016, achieved unicorn status last year, and by February 2022, it was valued at $3 billion having raised $250m in Series D. This made the company the most valuable African startup, surpassing the $2 billion valuations set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash in 2021.\n\nWell, there\u2019s quite a bit to unpack here that should make for some interesting reads. Please keep your eyes peeled on this space.\n\nNenne Nwodo\u2019s dream at age 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nHow many of us are the people we aspired to be as children? Is this you? Certainly not me!\n\nWhile many of us are not what we wished to be when we were kids, a few of us are, and this can be attributed to our environment and background, among other factors.\n\nStudies have shown that one\u2019s environment \u2013 physical, emotional, mental, or social \u2013 significantly impacts one\u2019s career decision-making process.\n\nFor example, as a child, I aspired to be a doctor, an engineer, and a banker. Aside from my background, my environment played a significant role in my decisions.\n\nHowever, I am not doing any of these things right now. In fact, I didn\u2019t study any of them. So, we can conclude that I did not pursue my childhood dream.\n\nYesterday, though, I read about Nenne Adaora Nwodo, a 25-year-old Microsoft software engineer who is pursuing her six-year-old dream. Plus, I must say that her story is interesting and encouraging.\n\nFun fact about Nwodo: She is an author, a public speaker, a YouTuber, a DJ, a creator of digital content, and an entrepreneur. All of this, and she still works for Microsoft? What exactly is she doing right?\n\nSidebar: Despite the fact that her environment and support system had a significant impact on her career choice, she did and continues to do the work. I\u2019m not going to give you any spoilers, though.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole, our Senior Reporter, had a 90-minute conversation with Nwodo, a Stanford Graduate School of Business (Stanford GSB) student, for The Experts, and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll be inspired.\n\nPlease, take a look at it here: How Microsoft\u2019s Nenne Adaora Nwodo is living the software engineering dream she had as a 6-year-old\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nNCC\u2019s warning on NIN-SIM linkage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember last week\u2019s Friday story: Is the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over? This is a follow-up story.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, April 11, 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) stated that telecoms consumers whose Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards have been blocked from making calls would not be unblocked by service providers until their SIM cards are linked to their National Identification Numbers (NINs).\n\nWhy? The statement was deemed necessary by the NCC in light of a suspicious viral link attempting to compel the Commission to reverse its decision.\n\nPer the statement, the Commission said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the NCC wishes to state categorically that it never issued such a statement, directing subscribers or indicating that subscribers can unbar their SIM without a NIN. As such, the originators and peddlers of the spurious message were out to mischievously mislead unsuspecting members of the public. Therefore, their message should be disregarded.\u201d\n\nRecall that on Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all SIM cards not linked to NINs. But turns out some persons who had NINs still had to go through a process called validation to ensure it works.\n\nStill don\u2019t know how to validate your NIN and avoid crowds? We\u2019re here to help you get through it. To know how, please click on this link.\n\nMoreover, on Thursday, April 7, 2022, Techpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm a situation at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, but they were met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nThen again, while I am undecided about the deadline extension, following the NCC\u2019s lead, please be advised not to fall victim to any scam perpetrated by the average Nigerian. Please safeguard your data.\n\nPylon\u2019s $19 million seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Egyptian infrastructure management platform for water and electricity companies, Pylon, has raised $19 million in seed funding.\n\nThe round was led by Endure Capital. Cathexis Ventures, Loftyinc Ventures, Khawarizmi Ventures, and a number of unnamed angel investors also participated.\n\nWhat problem does the company solve? Pylon addresses a number of issues for water and distribution companies. For starters, these companies have a very high rate of uncollected bills and thus lose out on a lot of money. Second, they have high electricity costs and water theft. Lastly, technical failures occur on the grid and network due to a lack of maintenance or law enforcement.\n\nThe company, founded in 2017 by Ahmed Ashour (CEO) and Omar (Radi co-founder and CTO), creates solutions for these water and electricity distribution companies in order to increase efficiency and stop the bleeding \u2014 the company estimates hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in emerging markets each year.\n\nHow does this work? Pylon\u2019s software collects data from grids, analyses it, and determines where theft and losses occur in the supply chain. It then automates billing processes for the businesses.\n\nWhile the company is currently based in Egypt and the Philippines, a portion of the seed investment will be used to expand into other emerging markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are all born differently, but we\u2019re also born differently gifted; so we should learn to give all of ourselves so that we can die empty.\u201d \u2014 Adora Nwodo, Software Engineer, Microsoft.\n\nSometime in October 2021, Adora Nwodo (officially named Nenne Adaora Nwodo) had a conversation with her brother who suggested she take a business/management course to gain valuable insight to propel her to the next level in her career. It sounded like a great idea, so she immediately set out to find a US institution that would be the best fit.\n\nOf course, she had her eyes on Ivy League schools majorly for the network and wealth of experience they offer. You\u2019d be right to guess that her options were limited to Oxford, MIT, Stanford, and similar schools.\n\nShooting from her room in Lagos, Adora Nwodo took the 4,800+ subscribers on AdoraHack, her YouTube channel, through her journey to becoming a Stanford Graduate School of Business (Stanford GSB) LEAD Online Business Program student.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSporting a burnt orange hoodie branded with the logo of her social brand, AdoraHack, the 25-year-old cloud engineer narrated her story, from her admission to what to expect in the future.\n\nHeads-up, Adora is also known as Big Nenz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nAdora says Stanford GSB is a perfect fit for her because she wants to have a complete school experience and keep her Microsoft job, which she speaks about glowingly.\n\nYou\u2019d be wrong to conclude that being a YouTuber and Stanford MBA student is all there is to Adora; creativity is also a part of her arsenal.\n\nAs part of the development team building applications for Microsoft Mesh, a mixed-reality platform, she devises tools that allow people in different physical locations to join collaborative meetings virtually and share holographic experiences.\n\nFurther defining her role, she says, \u201cI am building the cloud services that make up the entire platform, and it\u2019s been an experience. I\u2019ve learnt a lot in the process, and I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything!\u201d\n\nOn a sunny Saturday morning in March, I spent some time with Adora at a hangout spot on Lagos Mainland. Before she ran off for a family engagement, we talked for about 90 minutes about everything from what drives her to her passions to all it took to get where she is today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a conversation with Nenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nSpeaking with Adora, a firm believer in intentionality, focus, interdependence, and putting oneself out there as comfortably as possible, it was easy to see what lessons she\u2019d learnt from her experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need to learn to be teachable because that\u2019s how you would grow,\u201d Adora began, picking up momentum, \u201cHave an open mind! If your mind isn\u2019t open, nothing can enter; you can\u2019t learn.\u201d\n\nA loaded background\n\nGrowing up in the economic city of Lagos, Nenne Adaora Nwodo \u2014 an intelligent child and an avid reader \u2014 had the most unusual childhood.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I didn\u2019t know who I was before the whole tech thing. I\u2019m one of those people who started playing with computers as early as age six.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nThe youngest of three children, Adora unconsciously developed a liking for computers early so she could be closer to her brothers \u2014 her playmates \u2014 who spent most of their time practising what they learnt during their computer lessons on the desktop computer their father got them, instead of with her.\n\nShe credits her brothers for teaching her the basics of using the desktop computer, which quickly became a common interest they shared and brought them closer together. But as she spent time with her brothers, Adora\u2019s obsession with the machine grew. Before her tenth birthday, she had taught herself to type faster, navigate Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, and make amateur designs on CorelDraw, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe PageMaker.\n\nAround the same time, she was introduced to social media \u2014 Myspace \u2014 and got her first yahoo.com email under the supervision of her father and much older brothers.\n\nShe quickly pointed out that the Internet was a much saner and safer place.\n\nAdora grew more attached to the computer than her brother because she found it captivating and intriguing.\n\nShe fondly recalled her reactions when anyone said anything computer-related around her, and how that informed her decision to become a programmer when she grew up. Following her dream, Adora began her programming journey with Visual Basic, HTML, and CSS in secondary school, before graduating with a first-class in computer science from the University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nAnyone who has chosen a career can attest to self-discovery being a lifelong process. And historically, African parents or guardians compel their children or wards to select what they consider to be courses in lucrative industries.\n\nAdora\u2019s decision to get into software engineering was the result of foresight. She did not lack guidance and mentorship from her family and a few supportive people. Also, UNILAG\u2019s computer science department\u2019s excellent curriculum contributed to her exploits.\n\nInto the career-verse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nAdora\u2019s time at UNILAG defined her interest; \u201cI just wanted to build things,\u201d she recalled.\n\nFrom writing code to confirm the correctness of a math assignment to building websites, her ability to bring random ideas to life gave her an adrenaline rush that propelled her to do more.\n\nNow is a good time to mention a few of her pet projects.\n\nShe has built a food blogging website, a complete Android project (an app and a backend API), a local search engine (a school project), a media encryption app for Android, a Game of Thrones Trivia Android app, and a plagiarism detection software (final year project) named Third Eye, among others.\n\nAdora got her first formal role as a software developer intern at an advertising agency in her penultimate year in school; she continued in this role until she graduated.\n\nShe went on to do her mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) with the agency. By the time she was rounding off NYSC, she\u2019d already garnered over two years of work experience, and it was difficult for them to let her go when she was ready to change jobs because of her excellent work ethic and team spirit.\n\nShe left the agency for Microsoft in August 2019, when the company had an open opportunity for mixed reality in Africa.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft reached out to me on LinkedIn because, at that time, I was already volunteering with a bunch of communities, and I was vocal about the kind of work I was doing and the kind of work I was interested in.\u201d\n\nBefore the invite, Adora had consistently made her interests in AI-powered technologies public through Linkedin posts.\n\n\u201cAnd this is what I tell people, \u2018Always put out what you want to do to the public. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s listening,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAdora\u2019s work on the Microsoft Mesh team cuts across software engineering, DevOps, and security compliance. She mainly works remotely, with a typical workday beginning at noon and ending around 7 p.m. when she takes some time to relax.\n\nMicrosoft Mesh is powered by Azure, which makes Azure Cloud one of Adora\u2019s most frequently used tools at the moment. She uses programming languages like C#, TypeScript, C++, PHP, and Javascript.\n\nWhat\u2019s more?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nAdora has been drawn to tech for most of her life and was privileged to pursue it early. She is driven by the philosophy that love can heal the world, her desire to make the world a better place, and driving inclusion for women in tech.\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo is getting more involved in the developer community, contributing to subject matters at conferences and meetups, writing books, and blogging about her career growth, software engineering, and lifestyle.\n\nIf Adora didn\u2019t become a software engineer, she would have been a fashion entrepreneur or DJ. Interestingly, she had tried her hands on fashion entrepreneurship in the past and currently passes her time DJing.\n\nAdora either hangs out with friends, goes to fancy restaurants, swims, video calls friends, or takes random self-care breaks to unwind.\n\nConsidering how much of Adora is on the Internet, she was extremely shy and battled anxiety and stage fright early in life. However, she overcame this with years of deliberate effort to be vocal and speak at community gatherings.\n\nAsides from scheduling and daily planning, As an author, a public speaker, YouTuber, DJ, digital content creator, and entrepreneur, her greatest life hacks are delegating, multitasking, scheduling and daily planning.\n\nUltimately, Adora dreams of a time she would take a tour of Egypt, Rome, and the Middle East for a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Economists have painted another unsavoury picture of the Nigerian economy and their prognosis isolates six factors that are piling woes on already beleaguered businesses and households, according to a report analysed by BusinessDay.\n\nFirstly, they said Africa\u2019s largest economy, which is yet to recover from the destruction caused by two economic contractions in five years, will face more slowdown in growth, with the next round of GDP figures projected to come in below population growth levels.\n\nNigeria recorded a real GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 2021 but with agriculture, the single largest contributor to GDP, and oil and gas, as well as industry, challenged, the outlook for the whole economy in 2022 is poor.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in a March 23 report expects Nigeria\u2019s economic growth to slow more than expected in 2022 as power-supply issues, high inflation and expected monetary tightening hurt output.\n\nFrom an initial forecast of 3.3 percent in February, the EIU now expects real GDP growth to decelerate to 3 percent in 2022. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are less optimistic with growth projections of 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent, both of which are lower than the country\u2019s population growth rate.\n\nIn another expected blow to GDP growth in 2022, the recent warnings from the telecom sector, which has powered growth for three years now, suggest that the sector is also being squeezed.\n\nA second area of worry for the economy is the paradox of a failure to benefit from the spike in global oil prices and supply shortages.\n\nAfrica\u2019s top crude producer has failed to take advantage of oil prices that have been trading at an eight-year high as it has been battling to ramp up output to reach its full OPEC+ quota due to persistent production troubles.\n\nEnergy exporting countries across the world are reaping a sudden windfall but not for Nigeria, which for the first time is seeing significant pressures on both foreign exchange supply and public revenues at a time of rising oil prices.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil and gas sector expanded by 10.9 percent, according to the country\u2019s General Authority for Statistics. Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, on the other hand, contracted by 8.1 percent in the same period.\n\nNot surprisingly, while Saudi Aramco declared a 124 percent increase in operating profit to $110 billion, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation declared only $700 million in 2020.\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is hobbled by low crude production amid a scandalous level of crude oil theft, dwindling investment, high cost of production and the debilitating effect of a petrol subsidy regime that has spiraled out of control.\n\nRead also: What is the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on Africa\u2019s trade and economy?\n\nThe third strong wind pulling down the Nigerian economy, according to the report, is the worsening external position exacerbated by falling foreign investment.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit ballooned to N1.94 trillion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nForeign direct investment for the whole year fell to the lowest on record at $698.78 million, according to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria, due to the perceived harsh business environment.\n\nFourthly, the Nigerian economy is confronted by falling foreign reserves despite rising oil prices, which reached a peak of $139.4 per barrel on March 8, 2022. While the issuance of Eurobonds and support by the IMF helped to shore up the reserves for some time, the impact of that is now fading, according to the economists and data from multilateral agencies.\n\nThe report identified the fifth wind blowing against the Nigerian economy to include persistent fiscal pressures rising, with the continuous decoupling of revenues from high oil prices amid soaring public debt.\n\nNigeria\u2019s public debt rose by 4.2 percent to N39.6 trillion as at the end of 2021 from N38 trillion in the third quarter of 2021. Total debt saw an increase of 20.4 percent in the whole of 2021 and so far this year, Nigeria has borrowed more by way of a Eurobond of $1.25bn and another N296.37 billion in local debt via FGN bond issuance in March 2022.\n\nOn a granular level, the net effect for the average Nigerian is that he or she is getting poorer, buffeted by rising inflationary pressures and worsening disposable income for each household in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nIn US dollar terms, real per capita income for the average Nigerian collapsed from $889.82 in 2020 to $775.76 in 2021, a fall of 13 per cent in just one year.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poverty count (Nigerians who cannot afford N450 a day) has shot up from 85.2 million in 2020 to 90 million in 2021 and is now projected by the World Bank to rise further to 95.1 million this year, despite claims by the government that it is working to cut the number of Nigerians falling into the poverty pit.\n\nAt an ongoing investment expo in Dubai, potential investors were expressing worry about Nigeria\u2019s worsening macroeconomic instability symbolised by FX and market volatility and other issues, including security challenges, high operating cost, regulatory insensitivity, and the worrying collapse in public power supply.\n\nThe economists concluded their report by saying that Nigeria\u2019s business environment \u201cis highly volatile and is faced with a unique set of challenges that are being worsened by the global shock.\u201d\n\nThe economists counselled businesses pummelled by these forces to seek mitigation in cost efficiency, focus on their customers, improve their marketing and to focus on their core competence.",

          "text": "In little over a year, Nigeria would be choosing a new leader, a leader most Nigerians hope will be remarkably different in competence and talent than President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cI have never seen such incompetence like I see with this President and his government,\u201d a European diplomat covering economic and trade told BusinessDay. \u201cThey came, they saw and they destroyed.\u201d\n\nHis election in 2015, under a cumulus of expectations that he himself and his party the All Progressives Congress (APC) had encouraged, marked the first time in Nigeria\u2019s 55-year history as an independent state that a ruling party was ousted by the ballot, not the bullet.\n\nIn a well-choreographed campaign that vaunted him into the leadership of the nation that year, Buhari promised to focus on three key priority areas when elected. He vowed to ensure the safety of Nigerians by putting an end to Boko Haram and other forms of insecurity in the country. He threatened corruption, promising to kill it \u2018before it killed us\u2019, and also swore to Nigerians that the economy would change for the better.\n\nWith just a year left for him to leave Aso Rock, Buhari and his government have failed to change any of those three areas to critical success stories. Rather it has been one big unwholesome story of missed opportunities.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s allies quixotically claim he is in hurry to develop the country, most Nigerians believe that he has failed to achieve any perceptible modicum of meaningful development or indeed growth in the last seven years. A citizens\u2019 perception and attitude survey on topical issues and trends covering a potpourri of social, economic, political, governance and public-life issues released in March by Africa Polling Institute (API) found that only one in 10 Nigerians (eight per cent) are happy with the current state of affairs in Nigeria, under Buhari.\n\nBuhari came into office under a massive cloud of goodwill from Nigerians and the international community. Aloof, kinetically unsociable and inflexibly tribal, Buhari turned deaf ears to the numerous opportunities that could have transformed Nigeria. Rather, like an unskilled shipmaster, he ran the country aground.\n\nAlmost every sector of the country\u2019s social and political economy under Buhari\u2019s leadership has come under unparalleled internal shocks of ineptitude, intellectual apathy and the beatification of insensitivity. The opportunities lost are massive and telling, so are the attendant fallouts that could take decades to repair.\n\nA politics of injustice, division and disconnection\n\nOn May 29, 2015, Nigeria was in dire need of healing the variegated political, ethnic and religious divides occasioned by the fierce contest for political power between the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party and the opposition APC. Twerking in victory that was legitimised by the gracious acceptance of defeat by the then incumbent, Buhari signalled the divisive, Kafkaesque nature of his politics. He had no interest in uniting the country. Questioned at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in July 2015 on what he intended to do about the Niger-Delta with respect to amnesty programme and socio-political inclusiveness, Buhari made it clear, he was going to treat constituencies that gave him \u201997 percent\u2019 of their votes better than those that gave him \u20185 percent\u2019 of their votes. By this, he indicated that he was going to engage in non-nationalist pork-barrel politics that would give more power and projects to the core Northern states where he had garnered the most number of votes.\n\nIt was a shocking statement that reaffirmed the nativist tendencies of a president falsely modelled as a nationalist by his campaign managers. The clannish nature of Buhari\u2019s politics was further accentuated by his lobbying the World Bank to prioritise its developmental programmes across the northern parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn my very first meeting with President Buhari, he said specifically that he would like us to shift our focus to the northern regions of Nigeria and we\u2019ve done that,\u201d World Bank\u2019s immediate past president Jim Yong Kim told reporters in Washington.\n\nOutside projects and programmes, Buhari\u2019s appointments have been outrageously divisive, helping to heighten a feeling of disconnection from the nation\u2019s socio-political centre by populations in the Southeast and the Niger Delta. The president\u2019s tepid response to large-scale killings and destruction by Fulani militia in the Christian dominated Middle-belt region of Benue, Taraba, Kaduna and Plateau states further amplified the disconnect between Buhari\u2019s government and Nigerians who perceived his lukewarm response to the killings as a nod to his ethnic group\u2019s bloody grab for power and land.\n\nAn economy abused and misused\n\nWhen Buhari assumed office in May 2015, Nigeria\u2019s GDP, a measurement of the health and size of the country\u2019s economy, stood at $525 billion. Seven years later, Nigeria\u2019s GDP is $432.3 billion, some $90 billion sliced off the economy as a result of little to no growth since late 2015.\n\nThe opportunities to expand growth stared Buhari in the face. He had a chance to bring in the best brains and hands in and out of the country to help him run the economy. He had the chance to ensure a market driven exchange rate system that would have encouraged investors rather than a fixed exchange rate regime he so favours that has so corrupted the nation\u2019s FX system.\n\nBuhari chose an execrable economic management team, and Nigeria\u2019s economy has been on a freefall since then. While the president asserts that his administration\u2019s \u201cjob creation, policy consistency and innovation have since 2015 developed the economy,\u201d the fallacy and misconception in that statement, is obvious from the fact that the country in 2020 became the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cThe reality of the nation is that corruption, unemployment and inequalities have destroyed the nation\u2019s economic framework, causing it to be the poverty capital of the world,\u201d Krishna Panchal noted in a Borgen Magazine analysis in 2020.\n\nAccording to figures from data consulting firm StatiSense, in 2015, when Buhari came into office, 54.51 million Nigerians were fully employed. Five years later, only 30.57 million Nigerians had full employment. Unemployment rate, which stood at 10.4 percent in 2015, rose to 35 percent in 2021, up 6.06 percentage points from the 33.3 percent reported in 2020, according to figures from Agusto & Co.\n\nRead also: Buhari explains why Nigeria is rebuilding, expanding highways, bridges\n\nInflation rate which stood at 9.01 percent in 2015 currently stands at 16 percent and the nation\u2019s debt stock which stood at about 9 trillion naira when he came into power seven years ago, has now ballooned to about 32 trillion naira with nothing perceptible to show for Buhari\u2019s debt binge.\n\nThe depressing state of the Nigerian economy under Buhari, was aptly enumerated by the Economist magazine in its May 2019 edition, when it noted, \u201cthe Nigerian economy is stuck like a stranded truck. Average incomes have been falling for four years; the IMF thinks they will not rise for at least another six. The latest figures put unemployment at 23 percent, after growing for 15 consecutive quarters. Inflation is 11 percent. Some 94m people live on less than $1.90 a day, more than in any other country, and the number is swelling. By 2030 a quarter of very poor people will be Nigerian, predicts the World Data Lab, which counts such things.\u201d\n\nThe unskilled and insidious management of the nation\u2019s monetary and FX policies by a central bank keener on pleasing the political leadership of the country has left devastating cracks on the nation\u2019s economic landscape. Questionable economic policies of the administration, drove the World Bank to warn again in November 2021 that, \u201cthe government\u2019s exchange rate management policies continue to discourage investment and fuel inflation. FX management remains too rigid to respond to external shocks. Meanwhile, exchange-rate management has emerged as one of the key drivers of inflation\u201d.\n\nThe president, a retired diplomat and former senior national security officer, came in promising to stabilise the exchange rate. We had a clear case of the exchange rate being at about 160 to the dollar in 2015, now it has risen to almost 600.\n\nHe has not made any dent to unemployment, rather there is more desperation amongst our youths and you can see this in the glorification of yahoo boys, kidnapping for ransom and others, and poverty is just climbing.\n\nThe main reason I think this has happened is that the problem we have in this country is so deep that there must be a certain \u2018deliberateness\u2019 in any effort we are going to make to address the rot. Unfortunately, this \u2018deliberateness\u2019 has been lacking in this government.\n\n\u201cThe varied interventions of the central bank in different areas of the economy show the absence of a clear strategy to deal with the issue. There is no clear strategy of engaging with the citizens at coming clean with what is going on. What is required is a return to the drawing board to work with all stakeholders to lay the foundation for a better economy.\u201d\n\nIt was the need for this deliberateness that led the late economist and former CBN Deputy Governor, Obadiah Mailafia, to advise the administration that \u201cthere is a desperate need to diversify the economy away from dependency on petroleum.\n\nSecondly, they need to be able to balance the books, because right now the government has a revenue crisis on its hands and the debt situation is getting out of hand.\n\nAnd thirdly, they need to work on the expenditure framework. A lot of money is going down the drain and nobody knows what is going on there. It is not about having a yearly budget, it is about what the budget is achieving and the budget is not achieving anything.\n\nFourthly, we need to work on the central bank. CBN has been invaded and impacted by some bandits. We can\u2019t keep multiple exchange rates because it is just a drain pipe; what the Americans call a pork-barrel. We must fix it. There should be a single exchange rate and everybody must be subject to that single exchange rate with no favouritism of any kind.\n\nFifthly, we need to create a competitive economic environment. Right now, we don\u2019t have an economy that can compete for investments; we are losing investments to Ghana and Rwanda, investments that we cannot afford to lose if the government is keen on creating jobs and engendering growth.\n\nSixthly, we need to work on our tax policy. In an atmosphere of slow growth, you just don\u2019t increase taxes unless you want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg and it seems that\u2019s what they want to do.\n\nWe need to expand the tax base, not so much as increasing the rate. A lot of people and SMEs are not captured in the VAT. Let\u2019s not be lazy, let\u2019s make an effort to expand the VAT net by bringing in those who are presently outside it.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that a lot of the VAT paid by companies are not even remitted to the government, so there are many ways we can be innovative in expanding the tax base and even double and triple the revenue and income that goes to government, it is not just by the lazy approach of increasing the VAT rate\u201d.\n\nA Diaspora ignored\n\nHugo Cuevas-Mohr, in his analysis of the Nigerian diaspora and remittances, noted that \u201cone of the most fundamental acts of Nigerians when leaving the country is sending money home. Family is key for Nigerians and supporting their families back home is the ultimate expression of love, commitment and duty of Nigerians in the Diaspora.\u201d\n\nNigeria accounts for over a third of migrant remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, and according to PwC, \u201cthese flows amounted to $23.63 billion in 2017, $22 billion in 2018, and represented 6.1 percent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. The 2018 migrant remittances translate to 83 percent of the Federal Government budget in 2018 and 11 times the FDI flows in the same period. Nigeria\u2019s remittance inflows were also 7.4 times larger than the net official development assistance (foreign aid) received in 2017 of $3.4 billion\u201d.\n\nRemittances from Nigerians abroad rose to $14.2 billion in the nine months ending September 2021. Nigeria\u2019s diaspora possesses real and substantial resources, both in financial terms, and in terms of human capital, as noted in the US government census data.\n\nThey can be mobilised to be key players in trade links between Nigeria and their countries of residence. Despite the setting up of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission in 2017, Nigeria\u2019s government has not been able to mobilise the power of Nigerians abroad to drive and support Nigeria\u2019s economic development and diplomatic power.\n\nAn effective engagement with Nigerians in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa among others has the potential to build a power base for Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic and economic engagement with the world.\n\nAn OECD study found that, Diasporas and migrants returning to their country of origin can also influence political and civic life. For example, the study noted, \u201cseveral recent studies reveal that migrants have the potential to play a leading role in political change in terms of government changeovers, the level of democratisation and the formalisation and depersonalisation of institutions, and that they can also make stronger demands on local governments, particularly with regard to respecting basic rights. Finally, they can spur the demand for a more responsible and transparent government\u201d.\n\nThis, Nigeria\u2019s political leaders fear.",

No God-fearing citizen can excuse and readily dismiss the gross incompetence and ineptitude of a ruling government that was exceptionally high on promises but abysmally low on deliverables and performances,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves massive apologies from the APC apparatchiks who should be ashamed of the magnitude of damage they have wreaked on our long-suffering nation. No amount of fanciful diction, deceptive sophistry, pedantic casuistry or mendacious demagoguery can rescue them from the judgment of God for plunging our country and its people into unprecedented misery and penury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working hard and praying that our esteemed Party, PDP, and its members, most especially our super delegates, would resist all temptations from highest bidders and put country above pecuniary expectations, and deem it fit to give me the ticket to represent our Party at the forthcoming 2023 General Elections. We must demonstrate to Nigerians, and the world at large, that we are ready to offer our people a fresh beginning in a new world order propelled by education and knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe Ovation Magazine boss urged PDP political gladiators and juggernauts to stop flexing their muscles against one another and think not just about redeeming the lost glory of the party, and country, but also give thought to providing succour and comfort to the teeming masses of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecoming President of Nigeria should not be about the promotion and elevation of self as a result of previous lengthy political appointments. Getting to be Nigeria\u2019s President should be a matter of offering oneself humbly and honourably in order to serve our Fatherland to the best of our abilities,\u201d Momodu said.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs is a fresh leader, someone shorn of all the baggage, misadventure, mishaps and failures of the past. A charismatic leader and bridge-builder, with global experience and exposure, capable of assembling and commanding a combined and novel team of technocrats and politicians whose sole desire is to change their country for the better, rather than for self-aggrandisement and pillaging. This is the kind of President that is required to lead our country out of the drudgery and doldrums. I believe that I am that person and Leader.\n\n\u201cOur people truly have hope for a better future. They know that this will not come from a rehash or regurgitation of the same old wine in new bottles. They want real change. I have been a change agent most of my adult life. I believe that in the same vein, our reinvigorated Party should entrust me with the role of the change catalyst in Nigeria. I am new and untainted and primed for this task. Together, our future is bright and assured.\u201d",

          "text": "A sudden death is an unanticipated death. Though sudden deaths have different causes, they are all unexpected and consequently unanticipated.\n\nThe senior special assistant to the FCT minister, on health, Dr Ejike Orji, identified the things that can lead to sudden collapse and death as mostly metabolic and cardiac, adding that COVID-19 is also contributing.\n\n\u201cWhen I say metabolic, I am looking at things like diabetes. Somebody can suddenly die from diabetes if your blood sugar goes up so high. You can go into coma and if it is not corrected immediately, the person will die, the other one is hypoglycemia\u2013when there is low blood glucose in a person\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThere is also what we call cardiac event; if somebody has had hypertension for about ten years without knowing and not doing anything about it, it will affect the heart, the kidney and the brain. The one that will cause sudden death is if the blood pressure shoots up so high and an artery bursts in the vein, the person can die immediately. The other one is if the blood pressure is high and the person has cholesterol deposited in the artery, it will deposit so high that the person\u2019s blood, the one supplying to the heart, they can suddenly cloth and close and the blood supply to the heart, if the artery blocks, that person can die suddenly.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that is causing sudden death recently is COVID 19. People may have COVID 19 without knowing it, even when they have very severe symptom, they will still be saying is malaria, they will be in denial, they won\u2019t go to see a doctor and the coronal virus will start from the nasal until, it gets into the lungs and once people start desaturating, you will find out that within 24 hours, their blood oxygen will fall so low that it will not sustain life and they will die. Most of the people who die from coronavirus die due to that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe other thing that can cause sudden death is when people have Upper GI bleeding from peptic ulcer and the person did not manage it well and takes a drug that can cause massive bleeding. All of these can be found out if you do a comprehensive check every year once you are above 40, then every two years.\n\nOrji, however, said that health insurance has a big role to play as it makes it easy for a person to access healthcare because it\u2019s a pool resources scheme that will make you if you have a slight headache, you will like to go to the hospital since you know you are not going to pay as you have already paid the premium for the year.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s e-Passport has been ranked 99 best out of over 200 countries\u2019 passports in the world, as the passport holders can even visit a number of destinations without visas.\n\nQuoting Henley Passport Index second-quarter global passport ranking for the year 2022 report, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, described the stride as a \u201cno mean feat,\u201d adding it was indicative of Nigeria\u2019s passport acceptability all over the world.\n\nHe said Henley Passport Index is the original and authoritative ranking of the world\u2019s passports.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a two-day workshop for Passport Control Officers (PCOs) of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) held at the Service headquarters in Abuja, Aregbesola further revealed that the Immigration Service had between 2019 and the period under review issued about three million passports to Nigerians.\n\nThis, he said was despite the challenges of COVID-19, which greatly affected the availability of booklets and the passport issuing process.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, over 250,000 passports have been unclaimed by their owners and lying idle on the shelf,\u201d he said.\n\nHe again cautioned prospective applicants against patronising touts and NIS officials but to utilise the online portal to avoid being scammed.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIt is absolutely necessary, therefore, for all applicants to go to the NIS online portal to process their applications and avoid patronising touts and NIS officials.\n\n\u201cWe are taking complaints of solicitations and inflation of processing fees against NIS officials very seriously and will land a heavy stick of the law on culprits. Covert agents will soon be going around passport offices to apprehend touts and officials involved in these unwholesome practices. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. Be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that there have been challenges to passport administration over the years, the minister said it was for these reasons that the government introduced reforms into the passport administration system in Nigeria, to infuse the process with credibility and strengthen the integrity of the Nigerian passport.\n\n\u201cWe have adopted a processing period of six weeks to obtain fresh passports and three weeks for renewal. This is to enable the service to verify the identity and claims of applicants before issuing them the passport. For the enhanced passport, we have also synced the applicant\u2019s biodata with the National Identification Number (NIN) database. This means that the information you have with NIMC corresponds with your passport. This authenticates your identity,\u201d he further stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking directly to the Passport Control Officers, Aregbesola told them that, \u201cI need not remind you, that as PCOs, you are the drivers of these reforms in your various Passport Offices. Therefore, you must strive to eliminate unnecessary bottlenecks and shenanigans of nefarious individuals aimed at bringing the passport issuing process a bad image by making the process difficult for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYou must ensure that you provide the needed environment at your various Passport Offices for applicants to have the full benefits of the reforms in the issuance of passports.\n\n\u201cElimination of touting at Passport Offices, complete and total eradication of all forms of extortion and undesirable practices which constitute impediments in the process, ensuring that officers and men working in the Passport Offices maintain high levels of discipline, integrity and the desire to serve Nigeria and her citizens with every sense of patriotism are the imperative of effective and efficient service delivery.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to make these your minimum threshold in the course of your tenure at the various Passport Offices. Ensure that you leave a legacy of good service when you eventually complete your tour of duty.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the build-up to political party primaries for the 2023 general elections gathers momentum, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has requested a meeting with the APC members of the House of Representatives Wednesday (today).\n\nOsinbajo communicated this in a letter to Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, which was read by his deputy, Idris Wase, during plenary Tuesday.\n\nAlso, Akwa Ibom state Governor Emmanuel Udom, who is also aspiring for the number one seat on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), also wrote in to request a meeting with lawmakers elected on his party\u2019s platform same day.\n\n\n\nIn his letter, Vice President Osinbajo said he intended to host the lawmakers to iftar (Muslim\u2019s breaking of fast) at the Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja. \u201cHon. Speaker, invitation of the House of Representatives All Progressives Congress (APC) caucus to iftar/dinner.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan, it will be my great pleasure to host you on Wednesday, April 13, 2022. It is proposed that members arrive at 6:30, at the State House Banquet hall. I will appreciate your very kind assistance in conveying this invitation to all concerned. Please accept always the assurance of my highest consideration and regards\u201d, the letter stated.\n\n\n\nIn a similar development, Deputy Speaker Wase read out a letter by the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, inviting the PDP members to a meeting with Governor Udom at 8pm at House 50, Lobito Crescent, Wuse 2 Abuja.\n\nBello on zoning\n\nIn a related development, an APC presidential aspirant, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi state, has decried the agitation for zoning, saying this has not helped Nigeria since 1960.\n\nThe governor, however, asked Nigerians to place priority on competence, capacity and political will to develop the nation.\n\nSpeaking at an interactive session with newsmen Tuesday in Abuja, Governor Bello, who spoke through his Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, said Nigerians would be denied purposeful leadership if the principle of power rotation is adhered to ahead of the 2023 poll.\n\nFanwo said it behoves on the electorate to place the interest of the country ahead of ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nFanwo quoted the governor as saying: \u201cI was born in the North-central; I was born an Ebira man. I did not choose to be an Ebira. I did not choose to be a northerner. That should not determine criteria for hiring leaders.\n\n\u201cAssuming you are taken to a hospital and they say you need to be operated upon. You are not going to ask the admin secretary that the person who is supposed to treat you whether he is a Hausa man or he is from a particular ethnic group.\n\n\u201cYou would rather ask for a competent medical doctor to attend to you. Whether he is Hausa, Ibo or Nupe, it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is, is he competent to attend to me?\n\n\u201cNow, the driver that would take you from here to Onitsha, what you should be interested in is whether he is a good driver and not whether he is a Hausa man or any other tribe.\n\n\u201cSo when we use sentiment to reduce the race for the presidency to where he or she comes from, it doesn\u2019t help the country, it doesn\u2019t help Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, it is going to change. The zoning would be to competence, capacity and patriotism. That is where we are zoning it to. Whether the person is a northern, an Igbo or Yoruba, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. We have been zoning since 1960, are we better off?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that is the way to go and that is what we have come out to challenge. That is what Yahaya Bello is doing before we can talk of development. We are ready for the battle ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nBello assured that he would surely replicate the developmental strides recorded, coupled with the security of lives and properties in Kogi state if elected as president of the country in the 2023 poll.\n\nPDP receives report\n\nMeanwhile,ahead of the PDP presidential primary election slated for 28th and 29th May 2022, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom-led zoning committee Tuesday submitted its reports to the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nGovernor Ortom and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Ndudi Elumelu, were nominated chairman and deputy chairman respectively, while Emmanuel Ekpe was named as secretary.\n\nThe committee was given the mandate of recommending to the party whether zoning would help it return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and that which parts of the country to zone what to.\n\nAfter 3 meetings in the last 2 weeks, it was reported that the 37-man zoning committee also recommended that the ticket be open, a claim denied by the committee.\n\nElumelu represented Governor Ortom who was conspicuously absent during the submission of the report.\n\nThe lawmaker said: \u201cEvery member of the 37-man zoning committee had ample opportunity to make their submissions. Arising from our inability to conclude, we shifted it to 5th of April and in that 5th, we also unanimously and collectively took a united decision to promote the interests of the party and we came up with the resolution.\n\n\u201cI am not by virtue of the terms of reference allowed to roll out the content of the resolution because our job is to finish, submit and the National Executive Committee (NEC) will take a decision.\n\n\u201cSo I believe that is the NEC that has the statutory rights to release the content of what we have done. I must say that it was unanimously carried out and all the signatures of all the members of the zoning committee are there for you.\u201d\n\nAyu responds\n\nIn his response, PDP National Chairman Dr Iyorchia Ayu thanked the committee for a job well done.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of the work you have done; we did not hear any rancour. We did not hear anybody even talking about what you discussed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the sensitive nature of your assignment, if you had already released everything either by disagreement or rancour or anything, it will be very difficult for this party. But you showed so much maturity and leadership. And I believe all members of this great party appreciate the way you have conducted yourselves,\u201d the party chair said.\n\nWhile assuring that the committee\u2019s recommendation would be discussed at the party\u2019s National executive Committee(NEC) meeting, Ayu said the decision to be taken would be in the interest of Nigeria and PDP members.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis decision will be known to party members across the country and all Nigerians who are eagerly awaiting the final decision of your committee.\n\n\u201cWe hope you answer that call as you\u2019ve always done and help to unite this party in such a way that by next year, we should be talking of returning to 1999 and 2003 when we had twenty- something governors, controlled both houses of the National Assembly and controlled the presidency.\u201d\n\nSaraki, others on consensus\n\nMeanwhile, the consensus-seeking aspirants of former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, his Bauchi counterpart, Abdulkadir Bala Mohammed and renowned banker, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, Tuesday met with Enugu state Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in Abuja.\n\nBriefing newsmen after their meeting, Senator Saraki dismissed claims that the consensus move was to favour northern aspirants.\n\n\u201cWhen we started if you remember about three weeks ago, it was like three weeks now, most of the aspirants we had then were mainly in the north. We\u2019re talking to the aspirants across the country now because more people have come out in the South and we\u2019re all going to meet.\n\n\u201cAll the aspirants are going to meet. We are talking about Nigeria; we\u2019re not talking about the northern aspirants or southern aspirants.\n\n\u201cAnd I have good news that already moves are being made by the aspirants in the South to meet and eventually, we all will meet on consensus, that consensus is a Nigerian that represents all the groups.\u201d\n\nUgwuanyi replies\n\nIn his brief remarks, Governor Ugwuanyi, who thanked the aspirants for the effort to rescue Nigeria, said: \u201cI like to say this, I welcome consensus based on justice, equity and fairness.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nThe Senate Tuesday received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari seeking approval for adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter dated 5th April, 2022, and read during plenary by Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari explained that an adjustment to the 2022 budget became imperative in view of new developments in both the global and domestic economies.\n\nAccording to him, the developments were occasioned by spikes in the market price of crude oil, which were fallout of the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, there have been new developments both in the global economy as well as in the domestic economy which have necessitated the revision of the 2022 Fiscal Framework on which the 2022 Budget was based.\n\n\u201cThese developments include spikes in the market price of crude oil, aggravated by the Russian-Ukraine war, significantly lower oil production volume due principally to production shut-ins as a result of massive theft of crude oil between the production platforms and the terminals.\n\n\u201cThe decision to suspend the removal of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy at a time when high crude oil prices have elevated the subsidy cost has significantly eroded government revenues\u201d, he said.\n\nIn view of this, the president requested the upper chamber to approve an increase in the oil benchmark by US$11 per barrel, from US$62 per barrel to US$73 per barrel.\n\nHe also sought a reduction in the projected oil production volume by 283,000 barrels per day from 1.883 million barrels per day, to 1.600 million barrels per day.\n\nAlso, President Buhari requested the Senate to approve an increase in the estimated provision for PMS subsidy for 2022 by N442.72 billion which would increase total projected fund for fuel subsidy to N4trillion from earlier estimate of N3.557 trillion.\n\nPresident Buhari underscored the need to cut down on the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion, from N352.80 billion to N152.80 billion.\n\nHe proposed an increase in the projection for Federal Government Independent Revenue by N400 billion; and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cBased on the above adjustments, the Federation Account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.418 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account (net of transfer to the Federal Capital Territory and other statutory deductions) is projected to reduce by N1.173 trillion.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the amount available to fund the FGN Budget was projected to decline by N772.91 billion due to the increase in the projection for Independent Revenue (Operating Surplus Remittance) by N400 billion.\n\nThe president further said the Aggregate Expenditure was projected to increase by N192.52 billion, due to increase in personnel cost by N161.40 billion and other service wide votes by N21.05 billion (both for the Nigeria Police Force), additional domestic debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nGiving a breakdown, he said the net deductions would see a cut by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion for NDDC; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nAccording to him, the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99% of GDP.\n\nThe incremental deficit, he added, would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has given the go-ahead for the release of 40,000 metric tons of assorted grains to needy Nigerians from the nation\u2019s Strategic Grains Reserve (SGR).\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Mohammed Abubakar, made this known to newsmen on Tuesday, after a close-door meeting with President Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThis is just as the Director General of World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has warned that a potential food crisis was looming across the globe, especially for some African countries that relied on Russia and Ukraine for their food import.\n\nAccording to Abubakar, the execution of the president\u2019s order would be carried out by his ministry, in conjunction with the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, which would handle the distribution of about 12,000 metric tons of the total number.\n\nHe added that the same process deployed during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, to distribute 70,000 metric tons of assorted food items across some states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), would be used.\n\nAbubakar stated that in compliance with the presidential directive, grains are readily available for immediate distribution.\n\nThe minister explained: \u201cI\u2019m here this afternoon as a result of summoning by President Muhammadu Buhari. He actually directed and approved the release of grains from our Strategic Grain Reserve by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n\u201cThis is to cushion the effect of some of the issues we are facing with high prices of commodities across the country and also to cushion these festivities \u2013 Ramadan, Easter, Salah \u2013 so that there will be a little cushion for the people during these festivities.\n\n\u201cNot just us, the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also that we\u2019ll be given some of these grains also to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to also do the same distribution, the grain is coming from our Strategic Grains Reserve, as directed by Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOn the kind of grains Nigerians should be expecting to receive, the minister said, \u201cassorted grains. Usually we have sorghum, maize, millet and the rest of them, we will be releasing an assortment of grains that are in our grain reserves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are located across the entire country in all probably the six geopolitical zones, we have grain silos.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the effect of insecurity in the north-west and north-east on the nation\u2019s food security, Abubakar disclosed that government was doing everything humanly possible to prevent a drop in food production, adding that there had not been any impact on food supply so far.\n\nHis words: \u201cCertainly, some measure of insecurity might affect a bit of agriculture, however, as you can see, there\u2019s really no sharp drop in productivity in agricultural production. There\u2019s still food, and people are still cultivating in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cSome of the areas where it has some security implication, yes, it may have a little drop, but the government is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that production continues in other parts and even areas where there are issues, the government is doing whatever it takes.\n\n\u201cLike in the Ministry of Agriculture, we have Agro Rangers who sometimes provide some kind of security cover that will make sure food production does not stop. I can assure you that we don\u2019t have problems with food production at this point.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the effects of the Ukraine \u2013 Russia war, he said: \u201cWe have met about two to three times to discuss the issue of Ukraine. Yes, indeed, Nigeria imports grains and other agricultural input from Ukraine, we are making sure that we look inwards and outwards to make sure this conflict does not affect our agricultural sector.\n\n\u201cInwards-looking at fabrication of certain equipment that we can do. Also surveying and looking for areas that we can even produce our own fertiliser because we have the mineral deposits that are precursors to fertiliser production and also other places where we can import, apart from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBut the most important thing is to up our own agricultural production and this is without saying that no administration in recent times that has given the agriculture sector such an attention and funding as the current administration of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari\u201d, he said.\n\nAsked about other countries that are being considered as alternative sources of the products sourced from Ukraine, the minister said, \u201cthere are countries that produce other grains or the grains that we need, we\u2019re still in the process.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we\u2019re also looking inward to see what we can do to cushion the effect. Right now, I cannot give you the names, but it\u2019s something that we will. We will definitely make sure that we have no food shortage in this country\u201d.\n\nFood Crisis Looms, Okonjo-Iweala Warns\n\nMeanwhile, Okonjo-Iweala sounded the warning yon Tuesday during a hybrid media briefing on the WTO Trade Forecast, that took place in Geneva.\n\nAccording to her, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has put the fragile global trade recovery at risk and prompted WTO economists to reassess their projections for world trade over the next two years.\n\nThe WTO stated that the world merchandise trade volume was expected to grow three per cent in 2022, as against 4.7 per cent that was previously projected, adding that it would increase to and 3.4 per cent in 2023, \u201cbut these figures may be subject to revision due to uncertainty about the course of the conflict in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBut commenting on the anticipated food crisis, the director general of WTO said: \u201cThis war has seen a sharp spike in the prices of foods, energy, fertiliser and important minerals which Ukraine and Russia supplied to the world market. A potential food crisis is looming.\n\n\u201cFood and energy prices were already high by historical standards before the war.\n\n\u201cLow income food deficit countries saw their food bills rise 20 per cent in 2021, an increase of over $120 billion. Since early January, according to the International Grain Council, spot prices for wheat have risen as much as 31 per cent before falling back to 21 per cent, which is 20 per cent increase as at last week. Soybeans are up by 14 per cent and barley by more than 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five African countries import food from Ukraine, Russia or both. The problem of high food prices is compounded by high fuel prices. An expensive fertiliser represents a threat to future crop yields.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala went on to say that, \u201cthe war in Ukraine has created immense human suffering, but it has also damaged the global economy at a critical juncture.\n\n\u201cIts impact will be felt around the world, particularly in low-income countries, where food accounts for a large fraction of household spending.\n\n\u201cSmaller supplies and higher prices for food mean that the world\u2019s poor could be forced to do without. This must not be allowed to happen. This is not the time to turn inward. In a crisis, more trade is needed to ensure stable, equitable access to necessities.\n\n\u201cRestricting trade will threaten the wellbeing of families and businesses and make more fraught the task of building a durable economic recovery from COVID 19.\u201d\n\nShe said governments and multilateral organisations must work together to facilitate trade at a time of sharp inflationary pressures on essential supplies and growing pressures on supply chains.\n\n\u201cHistory teaches us that dividing the world economy into rival blocs and turning our backs on the poorest countries leads neither to prosperity nor to peace.\n\n\u201cThe WTO can play a pivotal role by providing a forum where countries can discuss their differences without resorting to force, and it deserves to be supported in that mission,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also expressed concern that supply chains that were already strained by the pandemic have been further roiled by the war, and disclosed that, \u201cthe WTO is working with shipping companies, port operators, logistics firms and other businesses by identifying specific problems and solutions to supply chain disruption.\n\n\u201cStructural issues from labour shortages and under investments in physical infrastructure to insufficient use of digital technology for supply chain oversight and border clearance all did the ground work for today\u2019s woes and need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nThe director general clarified that the ongoing war in Ukraine has not grounded the activities of the WTO.\n\nShe said: \u201cProceeding at the WTO has not been immured from the challenges resulting from this war. But it is simply inaccurate to say that the WTO has been paralysed since the outbreak of the war. We have developed walk around that have enabled us to conduct business even with diplomatic tensions running high.\u201d\n\nHowever, the WTO stated that World GDP at market exchange rates is expected to increase by 2.8 per cent in 2022 after rising 5.7 per cent in 2021.\n\nIt said output growth should pick up to 3.2 per cent in 2023, assuming persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe trade organisation stated that the, \u201cvolume of merchandise trade rose 9.8 per cent in 2021. The US$ value of this trade grew 26 per cent to $ 22.4 trillion. The value of commercial services trade was also up 15 per cent in 2021 to $ 5.7 trillion.\n\n\u201cServices trade will also be affected by the conflict in Ukraine, including in the transport sector, which covers container shipping and passenger air transport.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, the senator for Plateau South in the National Assembly, Professor Nora Dadu\u2019ut, and her counterpart in Plateau Central, Hezekiah Dimka, have described the recent bloody terrorist attacks on Kanam and Wase communities in Plateau State as atrocious, saying the perpetrators must be brought to justice.\n\nThe condemnation came as the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, said the country was at the verge of collapse. Kukah said Nigeria needed urgent measures to salvage it, especially in the face of an alarming spate of insecurity.\n\nThe Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), in its reaction to the worsening security situation, advised Buhari to \u201cimmediately\u201d resign from office.\n\nAmid the widespread mood of resentment and anger in the country, at least 23 persons were yet again killed on Monday in Benue State, when assailants believed to be herders attacked two communities in the state.\n\nSome bloodthirsty terrorists had at the weekend killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others after an invasion of communities in Plateau State. The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that, unfortunately, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nHowever, the president in a statement issued on Tuesday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, directed that the perpetrators of the dastardly acts should not be spared or forgiven. The president ordered the law enforcement agencies to work actively with the Plateau State government to bring the situation under control and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nBuhari expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks, saying as a matter of priority, peace must return at all costs to the state and the entire country.\n\nThe president urged, \u201cOur citizens, the people of Plateau State, in particular, to expose the perpetrators of such incidents, their sponsors and those who encourage such criminals who carry out these dastardly acts of murder, so that the law will take its course.\u201d\n\nHe added that the criminals \u201cmust not be forgiven\u201d.\n\nA statement in Jos by Dadu\u2019ut urged the federal government to expeditiously apprehend the perpetrators of the Plateau killings and bring them to justice. She also called on the federal government to put machineries in place that would ensure that criminals do not escape arrest and prosecution.\n\nDadu\u2019ut said, \u201cI condole with the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, the Senator representing Plateau Central, and the people of the local government council over the sad incident.\u201d\n\nDimka also commiserated with the affected communities. He said he recently paid a condolence visit to the Executive Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, Dr. Dayyabu Garga, over the killings and wanton destruction of property. Describing the act as disheartening, sad, and unfortunate, he reiterated his appeal to the federal Government to come to the rescue of the state.\n\nThe senator called on the security agencies to intensify efforts to expose the masterminds of the killings and bring them to book as a deterrent to others.\n\nDimka said, \u201cI wish to most heartily, on behalf of the people of Plateau Central, condemn these dastardly acts of taking the lives of innocent people and destruction of property and to console the families of those who have lost their loved ones in the course of these senseless attacks.\u201d\n\nDimka said he was touched by the barbaric act perpetrated by the bandits, who used the land donated to the state government for ranching at Garga to infiltrate the communities that were attacked last Sunday.\n\nThe senator was reported to have donated bags of millet, sugar, salt and maggi as his contribution to efforts to alleviate the suffering of the affected communities.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 23 locals were killed on Monday night in Benue State, when suspected armed herders attacked their communities. The attacks occurred on at Mbadwem and Tiortyu communities in Guma and Tiortyu local government areas, respectively, state authorities said.\n\nChief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Nathaniel Ikyur, confirmed the killings, in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nOrtom condemned the killings and asked the people of the state to rise and defend themselves.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cIt is becoming increasingly glaring every day that my people are now an endangered species and so we can no longer wait for help from anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe was also quoted as saying in the statement, \u201cMy people will have to rise up to the occasion to defend themselves and their heritage against the Fulani army of occupation.\u201d\n\nApart from the killings, the governor\u2019s aide said scores of others were injured and had been taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nDuring the attack on Mbadwem, no fewer than eight people were reported killed, while 15 people lost their lives in Tiortyu.\n\nOrtom lamented, \u201cWe are law-abiding citizens; we have cried for help against these invaders, but nothing is forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe are left alone, and it looks like it is a deliberate strategy.\n\n\u201cNow we have only one option: to defend ourselves or get extinct. This is a case for our survival. We have been accommodating of other people in our land, but our hospitality is misconstrued as weakness. We are not a conquered people. We will never be. We are free-born citizens of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe governor called on the security agencies to do more in crime prevention and protect the lives and property of the people in the state. He also urged the residents to cooperate with security agencies to flush out the undesirable elements in the society.\n\nThe state government, Ortom said, will not shy away from its commitment to providing welfare and security for its people.\n\nInsecurity: Nigeria on the Verge of Collapse, Says Kukah\n\nKukah expressed concern over what he called abandonment of Nigerians to their fate in the face of terrifying insecurity.\n\nThe Bishop said, \u201cNigerians are like orphans in the face of this difficult situation with nobody to console them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after the Chrism Mass at the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral, Sokoto, yesterday, Kukah said Nigeria was in a war situation, even though the authorities were not willing to admit that. He explained that the situation in Nigeria was inexplicable, stressing that Nigerians have since placed their fate, belief, and hope in God to bring about the needed change in the country.\n\nThe clergyman also expressed worry over the activities of fraudulent individuals using religion to compound the woes of citizens by subjecting them to all forms of manipulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe scripture has told us very clearly that there is nothing that is happening to us now that is new, that hasn\u2019t happened before, there is nothing that is new.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the idea of spirituality in any religion was to provide man with moral anchor, saying, \u201cReligion doesn\u2019t make the problem go away and I am saying, for me in the Catholic Church, we have no discount.\u201d\n\nKukah added, \u201cWe are in a very dangerous time when many people and fraudsters are using the message of Christ in a way and manner that may suite the challenges of the moment.\u201d\n\nIn another development a resident of Isa local government of Sokoto State, Musa Abdullahi, said it would take the grace of God to eradicate banditry in the region.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, these people have succeeded by recruiting informants, who tell them the movement of security agencies,\u201d Abdullahi added.\n\nHe stated that the insecurity in the North-west had political undertone, stressing that the terrorists are living among the people, \u201cbut nobody is willing to expose them.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that the hands of security agencies were tied due to the law of engagement.\n\nNorthern Elders Call for Buhari\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF), in a statement signed by its media chief, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, called for the president\u2019s resignation due to the high level of insecurity in the country.\n\nNEF stated, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration does not appear to have answers to the security challenges that we face.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to live and die under the dictates of assassins, kidnappers, rapists, and other criminal organisations who have robbed us of our right to live in peace and security.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for President Buhari to seriously consider that option, given his leadership\u2019s spectacular inability to provide security to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOur Forum recognises the importance of this advice and recognises that we cannot continue to live in these conditions until President Buhari\u2019s term ends in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed dissatisfaction with the incessant killings and attacks almost on a daily basis.\n\nIt said, \u201cKillers and other criminals appear to have detected a paralysing vacuum at the highest levels of government, and they have grown more confident and competent in subverting the state and our security.\n\n\u201cNigerians have shed enough tears and blood without receiving adequate protection from those who are supposed to protect us.\u201d\n\nThe forum advised Nigerians to exercise extreme caution when electing their leaders in the upcoming elections, saying the country urgently requires good leaders to lead it back to prosperity.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",

          "text": "The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock was expected to hit N45.86 trillion by December 2022.\n\nAccording to the President, LCCI, Mr. Michael Olawale-Cole, who spoke at a press briefing on the state of the nation, the country\u2019s debt stock was expected to increase following the federal government\u2019s plan to borrow an additional N1.6 trillion, while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing was pegged at N2.57 trillion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is also a plan to borrow N2.57 trillion from foreign creditors, while N1.16 trillion is expected from multilateral/bilateral drawdowns.\n\n\u201cIn total, the federal government plans to add N6.3 trillion new debts to the current debt stock, which would push the country\u2019s total debt stock to N45.86 trillion by December 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nThe LCCI boss noted that the 2022 federal government budget was now projected to have a deficit of N7.35 trillion from the approved N6.26trillion if the recent request for an additional deficit of N965.4billion by the president presented to the National Assembly was granted, explaining that in total, adding that with the new debts, the country was likely to have a higher debt service-to-revenue ratio if revenue levels do not increase significantly.\n\nFurthermore, he predicted tougher times ahead for the manufacturing sector of the economy going into the second quarter of the year, predicting that manufacturing concerns would likely suffer due to poor public infrastructure, and port-related challenges as these may continue to present as headwinds to the sector\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, with the war in Ukraine aggravating disruptions to supply chains of raw materials like wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflower, and corn, the rising cost of production may not abate soon,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the power sector, he said it was becoming clearer that the national grid cannot supply sufficient power to meet the nation\u2019s electricity demand, lamenting that on the back of the epileptic power supply, businesses have had to deal with the rising cost of manufacturing, exorbitant logistics, and constrained production.\n\nHe added that with the cost of diesel at record levels and persisting poor power supply, businesses had been running on unsustainable costs and producing at uncompetitive prices.\n\nHe warned that the situation could lead to job losses as output is constrained due to the unbearable cost of production.\n\n\u201cIf not quickly tackled, these challenges will likely subdue the GDP growth potentials and projections for 2022,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe LCCI boss added: \u201cThe government should create funding for critical infrastructure and special purpose intervention in the power sector. The newly launched Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infracorp) has a mandate to focus on power, renewables, transport, and logistics. The InfraCorp will succeed in mobilizsng private sector participation if we can achieve cost-reflective pricing in the power sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe gas-to-power infrastructure requires an overhaul to resolve the persisting gas shortage. However, the most sustainable solution to Nigeria\u2019s power shortages is the transition to renewable energy,\u201d he advised.",

          "text": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has said that Nigeria now has 3.3 million people displaced by various crisis rocking the nation, even as it revealed that modalities have been adopted that would stop youth from joining jihadists movement in the region.\n\nSpeaking at the Opening Ceremony of the Stakeholder Workshop on the Best Practices for Stabilization in West Africa, the Vice President of the ECOWAS Commission, Madam Finda Koroma said the issue of displacement in the West Africa region needs to be addressed.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe also need to address the crisis of displacement. For instance, Burkina Faso has experienced an explosion in its forced displacement crisis because of militant Islamist group violence originating in Mali. Its current 1.2 million displaced population represents a nine-fold increase from 2019.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, violent attacks by Boko Haram in Northeastern Nigeria, have resulted in the displacement of 2.5 million Nigerians, whilst kidnappings, extortion, and organised criminal attacks in the Northwest have displaced an additional 800,000 people.\n\nKoroma said: \u201cWe need to find a way to return these communities to the homes, safely.\u201d\n\nShe disclosed that: \u201cIt is against this backdrop that ECOWAS Commission, in partnership with development organisations and governments, have embarked on an ambitious journey of introducing interventions designed to stabilise conflict affected areas, address the root causes of insecurity, and set them on the path for sustainable development through recovery and building community resilience.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with the German government, we have established the ECOWAS Fund for Regional Stabilisation and Development in fragile member states. The objective of this programme is to stabilise conflict affected communities through provision of sustainable economic opportunities and essential services for conflict affected communities, construction or rehabilitation of key national infrastructure and capacity building for governance and security institutions.\u201d\n\nKoroma noted that ECOWAS Stabilisatiom programme was launched in The Gambia as a pilot project and in 2020, Guinea Bissau, Niger and Mali form part of the first phase of the regional project.\n\nShe revealed that the programme has so far committed about \u20ac45 million in the pilot and regional scale-up phases, stressing that: \u201cThe ECOWAS Commission has also contributed US$1 million on an annual basis since 2019.\u201c\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is worth noting that border communities are often most vulnerable to conflict and that many of our own interventions will necessarily include a cross border element.\n\n\u201cMoreover, projects that are implemented on both sides of border communities foster regional integration which embodies the main mandate of ECOWAS.\u201d\n\nThe VP said the UNDP in partnership with Lake Chad Basin Commission had helped to restore social contact between communities and their governments, rebuild trust, and provide communities sustainable livelihood options.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that we face security challenges, we must also support communities that are affected with stabilization programmes, including public infrastructures; construction and rehabilitation of schools and health centers, support to women and the youth so that they can themselves be trained to get employed or start their own businesses.\n\n\u201cWe also invited governors from Niger and Guinea Bissau, unfortunately Mali is under suspension, so we were unable to invite them to be here, but we are confident that this is a new beginning for ECOWAS, whereby anytime there is this peace keeping mission, it will also be matched with the stabilization programme.\n\n\u201cBeyond everything else, it\u2019s the issue of building trust between communities and their governments because this lies at the heart of conflict in everything we do and also to stop the youth from joining jihadist movement, because we are showing them that they can have oppoturnities to learn skills and go to school and do other things. That stop them from actually joining Jihadists movement that led to these problems\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Executive Secretary of Lake Chad Basin Commission, Amb Mamman Nuhu, assured that the effort being made by the\n\nCommission to address the challenges confronting the sub-region through the stabilization program would tackle the fragility and drivers of conflict in the region.\n\n\u201cIt will support the most vulnerable of\n\nour population, women and youth, to regain control of their means of\n\nlivelihood. This is because this group constitutes the majority of victims of\n\nconflicts and fragility in our region\u201d he added.",
