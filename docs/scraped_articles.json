          "text": "The Taliban on Sunday blamed the United States for the chaotic evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans and foreigners from the capital, one week after the hardline Islamist group returned to power in a rapid victory that stunned the world.\n\nThe United States has warned of security threats and the European Union admitted it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to evacuate everyone at risk from the Taliban, who have vowed a softer version of their brutal rule from 1996-2001.\n\nBut terrified Afghans continue to try to flee, deepening a tragedy at Kabul airport where the United States and its allies have been unable to cope with the huge numbers of people trying to get on evacuation flights.\n\n\u201cAmerica, with all its power and facilities\u2026 has failed to bring order to the airport. There is peace and calm all over the country, but there is chaos only at Kabul airport,\u201d Taliban official Amir Khan Mutaqi said.\n\nBritain\u2019s defence ministry said Sunday seven people had died in the crowds, without giving further details.\n\nA journalist, who was among a group of other media workers and academics lucky enough to get to the airport on Sunday for a flight, described desperate scenes of people surrounding their bus on the way in.\n\n\u201cThey were showing us their passports and shouting \u2018take us with you\u2026 please take us with you\u2019,\u201d the journalist told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban fighter in the truck ahead of us had to shoot in the air to make them go away.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Sky News on Saturday aired footage of at least three bodies covered in white tarpaulin outside the airport. It was not clear how they had died.\n\nReporter Stuart Ramsay, who was at the airport, called the deaths \u201cinevitable\u201d and said people were being \u201ccrushed\u201d, while others were \u201cdehydrated and terrified\u201d.\n\nThe footage was the latest imagery of utter despair, after video of a baby being lifted over a wall at the airport and horror scenes of people hanging onto departing planes.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Impossible\u2019 deadline -The United States, which has thousands of troops trying to secure the airport, has set a deadline to complete the evacuations by August 31.\n\nBut there are up to 15,000 Americans and 50,000 to 60,000 Afghan allies who need to be evacuated, according to the Biden administration.\n\nCountless others fear repression under the Taliban and are also trying to flee.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has described the evacuation operations as \u201cone of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history\u201d.\n\nThe situation was further complicated on Saturday when the US government warned its citizens to stay away from the airport because of \u201csecurity threats\u201d.\n\nNo specific reason was given, but a White House official later said Biden had been briefed on security threats, including from the Islamic State jihadist group.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell gave a bleak assessment of whether the airlift would succeed.\n\n\u201cThey want to evacuate 60,000 people between now and the end of this month. It\u2019s mathematically impossible,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nBorrell added that \u201cwe have complained\u201d to the Americans that their airport security was overly strict and hampering attempts by Afghans who worked for the Europeans to enter.\n\nOn Saturday, the Pentagon said 17,000 people had been taken out since the operation began on August 14, including 2,500 Americans.\n\nThousands more have left on other foreign military flights.\n\n\u2013 Taliban government -The Taliban have been publicly content with the US military overseeing the airlift, while focusing on forming a government.\n\nThe group\u2019s co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar flew into Kabul and planned to meet jihadi leaders, elders and politicians in the coming days, an official told AFP.\n\nAmong them are leaders of the Haqqani network, a US-designated terrorist organisation with million-dollar bounties on its leadership.\n\nThe Taliban stunned the world when they swept into Kabul last week, ending two decades of war, facing virtually no opposition from government forces that had been trained and equipped by the US-led alliance.\n\nHowever, there have been since been flickers of resistance with some ex-government troops gathering in the Panjshir Valley, north of Kabul, long known as an anti-Taliban bastion.\n\nOne of the leaders of the movement, named the National Resistance Front, is the son of famed anti-Taliban commander Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\nThe NRF is prepared for a \u201clong-term conflict\u201d but is also still seeking to negotiate with the Taliban about an inclusive government, its spokesman Ali Maisam Nazary told AFP in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe conditions for a peace deal with the Taliban is decentralisation, a system that ensures social justice, equality, rights, and freedom for all.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Alleged sale of vessels: IGP orders clampdown on suspects",
          "text": "\n\nBy Emma Nnadozie, Crime Editor\n\n\n\nDetectives at Force Headquarters, Abuja are on the trail of a gang of criminals that specializes in vandalizing and selling off vessels allegedly in connivance with government officials.\n\nTo this end, some government officials in the state and the suspected criminals have been invited by the police failure of which they would be declared wanted.\n\nSunday Vanguard learned the intervention followed a strongly worded petition sent to the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Alkali, by the Managing Director of Florence Petroleum and Marine Services, Dr. Henry Okey Obi, over the alleged illegal take over and sale of his vessel \u2018MT My Okiki.\u2019 Obi said he was in the United Kingdom on March 23, 2021, when he was alerted that some armed men led by a former Commissioner for Environment in River State, took the vessel worth in excess of N600 million in the open market anchored in a jetty at Okirika, River State. According to him, the vessel was sold to one Alhaji at 50 million.\n\nThe businessman also alleged that a permanent secretary in the state played a major role as he gave the authorization for the sale of the vessel on June 26, 2021, after claiming he could not find the owner.\n\nThe entrepreneur said it all started when the vessel, formally known as Mt Rex Condor until 2008, was bought by his company and rebranded it as Mt Okiki.\n\n\u201cThe vessel, which was used for bunkering fuel tanker with Nigerian flag to offshore platforms like Nigerian Agip Oil Company in Brass, SPDC and Chevron, was involved in a fire incident on May 7, 2013, en-route to supply Marine gasoil to Agip Brass.\n\nIt was later salvaged and anchored in a jetty at Okirika River State where the company pays jetty fees to the community that owns the jetty.\u201d Obi said ever since then, the company has been mobilizing funds to fix, repair and rebrand the vessel, adding that the company has already finished the electrical installations on the vessel after purchasing marine and armoured cables worth over seventy \u00a370, 000 from England.We have also done anti-rust priming and painting with zine oxides.\n\nWe have equally purchased a new brand engine from the Netherlands, which is already delivered to a warehouse in Lagos waiting to be moved to the vessel in Port Harcourt for installation. All these efforts cost our company over $500, 000.\n\n\u201cHowever, upon getting the information of the illegal possession of my vessel, I informed the company\u2019s operations manager, who wrote a petition on March 25, 2021, to the Inspector-General of Police, who approved investigation on the matter.\n\nWhen police invited the suspects, they procured forged documents including abuse of court processes, which aided their illegal act.\n\n\u201cA senior magistrate grade level one court awarded the court order that the conspirators relied upon to persuade the River State police command to discontinue the investigation of their evil act.\n\nThis was done even when it is known that magistrate courts in Nigeria do not have jurisdictions over vessel and admiralty matters, as a court order was procured from the magistrate court.\n\n\u201cThey also went ahead and vandalized my vessel after which they secured the services of armed DSS men that came, threatening anyone that comes close to the vessel.\n\nThey moved the vessel to a jetty owned by one Mr Abrakassa with the aid of DSS men, who provided materials and wielders that cannibalized the vessel beyond repair. \u201cI, therefore, instructed my lawyer to write a petition to the DSS headquarters in Port- Harcourt.\n\nIt was acknowledged but they claimed it was a presidential tax force that carried out the operation. I had to cry to the Force headquarters in Abuja, who then sent their men to stop this heinous act but by then, they had vandalized the vessel beyond repair. When the officers from Abuja got to Port Harcourt, they took over the case from the state command to continue the investigation at the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe suspects were ordered to stop scrapping my vessel pending the completion of investigation. Unfortunately, the main suspect had continued to openly flaunt his connection with people in power, boasting that he can get away with any crime and impunity he commits. They later offered me N10 million to forget about the vessel, which is worth over N600 million and I refused,\u201d he further explained.\n\nInvestigation revealed that when the suspects were invited by the police at Area 10, Force headquarters, Abuja, they failed to turn up. However, one of the Alhaji mentioned in the deal later surface claiming that he was only a go-between between another Alhaji and other suspects. As of press time, the detectives were making frantic efforts to arrest the suspects with a view to cracking down on the gang that specializes in carrying out the illegal mission.\n\nEfforts made to contact the suspects on phone failed but the former Commissioner for Environment in Rivers State, Mr. Igbiks Tamuno, who was mentioned in the deal spoke to Sunday Vanguard.He said: \u201cI left office nearly four months ago. While in office, the government set up a committee.\n\nThere were a lot of accidents occurring in our waterways due to abandoned vessels. So, we set up a committee within the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Transport.\n\nWhat they did was, any vessel that qualified for destination of rest are all those vessels that are causing problems. I\u2019m aware they had carried the vessel like that from one place in Agba and, in fact, at a point, moving it was a bit problematic.\n\n\u201cIf they stole it, I don\u2019t have a way of knowing. The intention of government was to remove all those vessels that are capable of causing accidents. Yes, the vessel may have, from history, been involved in a fire accident.\n\nAs a government, we did what we did. But at the point of vandalization or whatever has happened, I don\u2019t know anything. I am aware that even the Attorney-General and the Commissioner of Police had to write on behalf of the state government to the police to tell the police that this is the position of government.\n\nForce Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, could not be reached on phone but his Deputy, Aremu Adeniran, simply said, \u201cwe are still investigating the case.\u201d",

That is what the Taliban have been saying but Afghans who are seeking refuge abroad know that may not be true,\u2019\u2019 Nwauwa said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe called on the Nigerian government to ensure that its diplomats and citizens were evacuated from Afghanistan.\n\nNAN reports that the Taliban victory is the outcome of years of hardwork and strategy.\n\nAfghanistan has 400,000 soldiers yet the government was taken over by Taliban who supposedly had at most 75,000 fighters.\n\nWhen the U. S. and Nathan forces dislodged the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 9, 2011 bombing of the World Trade Center many of the Taliban fighters did not leave the country.\n\nA lot of negotiations took place between the tribal leaders in the country and the fighters.\n\nAs a result many of these fighters simply dropped their arms and were recruited into the Afghani army where they remained and rose through the ranks.\n\nThey got promotions, training, ammunition, and money legally from the U.S. for the years to come.\n\nAs soon as the U.S. began to withdraw its forces from the country based on the agreement reached with the U. S. \u2013 backed Afghan government, the Taliban struck and took over the government. (NAN)",

It was a wonderful experience because that gave me my business platform I have today, it put me out there and I did my best to capitalise on that opportunity because I know where I would want to be and I\u2019m very grateful for how far I\u2019ve come, so yeah, that\u2019s my story so far. I\u2019ve struggled hard, I am working harder, I have a lot of things I am putting together, with different people right now.\n\nHave you always acted before Big Brother?\n\nI was an actor before I came to Big Brother, just that I was not as known as I am right now. You know, as someone in the entertainment industry, you look for different platforms or different ways to elevate yourself as an entertainer, so that people can see you and you can now show people what you can do and that\u2019s exactly what Big Brother Africa did for me. Before I went into the House, I was acting, I told Africa while I was in the House, how much of an actor I was, how much of a passionate actor I was , then coming out, I got producers, directors, calling me and yes, that has brought me to where I am today and I\u2019m so grateful for that.\n\nDid you do modelling job also?\n\nWell, that\u2019s why I call myself an entertainer. Asides being an actor, I call myself an entertainer, I don\u2019t just streamline, do acting alone, because I also model, yes, I\u2019m a model and I still model till tomorrow. I prepare events, I\u2019ve hosted a lot of events, from fashion shows to awards, to pageants, I host events, yes and, of course, we do celebrity appearances, guest appearances, I mean, entertainment is a very big subject, so we try as much as possible to touch on every area. It is so detailed.\n\nYou featured in the latest movie of Jim Iyke, \u2018Bad Comments\u2019?\n\nYes, I did a guest appearance in \u2018Bad comments\u2019. It was amazing, it was an amazing experience.\n\nWhich other movie have you featured in?\n\nI have done a lot of movies, but let me talk about Bad Comments if you permit me. Bad Comments is a movie, I can\u2019t wait to see how the crowd would react after watching this movie. I\u2019m not speaking as an outsider now, I\u2019m an insider because I know how this movie is because, like I said, I was a guest appearance in the movie. Now, this movie is about today\u2019s reality, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy, I cannot wait to see how people are going to react because, like I said, I was very impressed, I was very satisfied to see the reaction of the crowd. I personally believe that the negative impact of what trolling and cyber bullying have done to our society is underestimated, so, this shows what happens to some celebrities, not just celebrities, more of humans out there, normal people out there, people are getting depressed everyday, people are dying everyday, suicide, because of what they see on social media, so that\u2019s what happens when we see movies like this because it just shows us so that we can learn and impact this kind of thing in our everyday lives , let people to know that what people are saying about you on social media doesn\u2019t define you as a person, pray for grace to do the right thing, work hard and you\u2019ll achieve what you\u2019re meant to achieve.\n\nHave you experienced bad media before?\n\nOh yes, I have, especially when I got out of the Big Brother house in 2014. I saw a lot of things, I experienced a lot of cyber bullying, people that had opinions of me or people that feel like they have opinions about me, then the kind of things they said about me, a lot of them lies and all that. At first, it got to me because at that point I was just like not ready for all the bullying I got that time, but with time, I had to realise, I had to tell myself look, these things don\u2019t define me as a person. Like I said, pray for grace, work hard, do what you\u2019re supposed to do and God will grant you your desires. Forget about these things , if you let them get to you, the negative commentary will affect you as a person and you cannot forge ahead. So, people need to understand the social media. Social media has brought a lot of negativity into our reality, so, people need to be strong and understand that you should not let these things get to you as a person.\n\nYou don\u2019t appear in movies as you used to, why?\n\nRight from time, I\u2019ve been taught and I\u2019ve been educated not to take any script that doesn\u2019t suit you, not because this producer wants you for a movie, that you scrutinise, you go through it, you look at the production as a whole, is it something you want to do? Is it something that will make you or mar you, so yeah, that\u2019s how it has been for me working. Yes, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of movies, last month I was busy, I\u2019ve been busy throughout the whole of last month, I\u2019ve rarely had a day to myself, I\u2019ve been working back to back and I still have a couple of scripts right now that I\u2019m still about to start shooting, so yeah, it\u2019s been very good for me so far, I just thank God.\n\nIn Nollywood, female actors say that before they\u2019re given a role, the producers lure them into relationships, sex and all that, and you too, you\u2019re good looking, so, before you get a role to play, what\u2019s your own challenge?\n\nI\u2019m aware of all those things that are being said about how directors and producers will only give a particular set of people, a particular set of female and male actors roles if they do this and that. I mean, we hear all these everyday, but the good thing is that I\u2019ve never been a victim of that, every single role I\u2019ve played in every single movie have been given to me on credit and actually recommendations, and actually close auditions, even open auditions. People would tell him, oh, this guy is good, try him out and see, yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since. So, these directors and producers, they try me out, in fact, 89 per cent, if not 90 per cent of the production houses, producers, the directors I\u2019ve worked with always call me back because they enjoyed my performance in their production and that\u2019s what it has been for me, so, yes , I hear these things no doubt, but I\u2019ve just been lucky or privileged rather not to be in that scenario. So, I can\u2019t talk much about it since I\u2019ve never experienced it.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re to advise anyone who wants to go for Big Brother Naija, what would you tell them because many still believe it is not morally sound to watch?\n\n(Laughs) I went for Big Brother Africa, not Big Brother Naija.\n\nBut it\u2019s still Big Brother?\n\nIt\u2019s still Big Brother, yeah, I think people should accept the positivity that the reunion does to people than the negativity. Now, these housemates were together for a couple of weeks and now, they left. Now, the reunion was what brought them back together again for the first time since they left the house. Now, going out of the house, you hear things, a lot of negative things, \u201coh do you know what this person said about you\u201d? This and that. So, I think, the reunion should be welcomed, people should see it as an opportunity to clear the air, \u201coh okay, I heard you said this about me, really?\u201d Then the person says \u201cno, this is what I said and this is why I said that \u201c. Okay then, you guys make peace , you guys clear it out and that\u2019s it. So, I believe that was the or that is the idea in doing a reunion show. You guys, okay, we know you don\u2019t meet, you don\u2019t talk about everything, but they\u2019re bringing you guys together now, what is your grudge against us, what do you guys have against this person, say it out.\n\nYou are very fashionable, what is your type of style?\n\nIn fact, style for me is expressing yourself, the way you look, the way you dress should tell the person you are, your mood, how you feel at that point in time, so, that\u2019s how it is for me. The way I come out is the way I\u2019m feeling at that point in time. I can be so casual at some point, it means that I\u2019m in that type of mood and I can come out very fashionable at some point, it means, that kind of mood is rare, yeah , so, fashion to me is just about expressing yourself through dressing.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite music?\n\nI\u2019m an all genre kind of person. Oh, yes, if it\u2019s rock, R \u2018n\u2019 B, that is fine. You can\u2019t find me listening to one kind of music. If you see my playlist, you\u2019ll be shocked. I mean you can call me a weird because my playlist has different types of music, rock, rap, soul, old school, reggae, everything, so that\u2019s my kind of person.",

          "title": "Zone to produce Secondus successor must be strong to win elections for PDP \u2013 Ebenezer Babatope",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nThere is no end in sight to the controversy trailing the tenure of Prince Uche Secondus as the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In this interview, a former Minister of Transport, Ebenezer Babatope, expressed optimism that the party would come out of the raging crisis stronger than ever.\n\nYour party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is in disarray over the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC). What is your take on the scenario that is playing out?\n\nThe governors of the PDP have met and they have told the world what will happen. We are going to have a convention and Secondus will manage the party until the convention. After the convention, he leaves. That is the solution.\n\nIf he goes after the convention, which zone are you expecting to produce the next chairman from?\n\nWe are going to ensure that the zone to produce the chairman will be the zone that will be able to win victory for the party in the 2023 elections.\n\nThere is agitation for the slot in the Southwest. Are you saying that the Southwest can ensure victory for the party in the coming elections?\n\nI belong to Bode George group of the PDP. We are going to take a final decision on this matter this week. As far as I am concerned, I believe the Southwest is a winnable zone and we are prepared to ensure victory for the party.\n\nWhat about powerful big wigs like the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, who are strongly opposed to Secondus?\n\nWike was party of the governors\u2019 meeting. One would have expected him to express his opposition at the governors\u2019 meeting before Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State informed Nigerians and the world about what is going to happen sometimes in October. Secondus will manage the party till that time and then leaves. I don\u2019t think there is anything personal issue between him and Secondus. They may have disagreement, but they can\u2019t destroy the party because of the disagreement. If he agrees with what the governors have said, it will help the party to move forward and reposition it to win the 2023 elections.\n\nThe contention of those opposed to Secondus is that the party has not been well managed or positioned to win the next elections. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nI want to assure you that by the grace of God, all members of the PDP , including all Nigerians, who are concerned about what is happening in the country, will ensure the defeat of APC government in the 2023 election. And when that happens, Nigerians will see that the PDP is desirous of victory. We will do everything in our party to ensure that we have that victory.\n\nElection is not about mere wishes, it is about programmes and organization. But you know, of course, that your party has already lost some formidable forces to the APC, including three governors and members of the National Assembly. Is that not an indication that the party needs to put its acts together to be able to put up a good fight?\n\nI agree with you that we have to get our acts together so that we can put up a good fight and that is what we are doing. We are doing everything to ensure that we put our acts together so that we can have victory. The point is that party organization is not rub my back and I rub your back. It is a serious matter that involves the support of everybody to ensure the victory of the party. What is happening now is a wakeup call for all of us to rise up and support the party to win the next elections. We are very mindful of the fact that we are serving the supreme interest of the Nigerian people and everything will be done to have victory.\n\nAs you have said, you belong to Bode George Southwest faction of the PDP. Would you say that everything is well within the Southwest of the party to guarantee its victory?\n\nIn Osun State, we are ready. We cannot say we don\u2019t have problems, but all problems will be put aside. We have a Chairman in the State, Mr Sunday Bisi, who is working hard to lead the party to victory in the coming governorship election in the state. Aside from that, our candidate is Senator Ademola Adeleke and we are going to make sure that his victory will be a total victory.\n\nYou spoke about Osun State, what about the Southwest as a whole?\n\nThat is my state and they say charity begins at home. We in the Southwest are ready. We have problems, but we are going to solve that problem. Don\u2019t forget that we had Southwest zonal election where Arapaja emerged as the chairman. We are going to work with him to give us direction.\n\nFor Osun State, are you foreclosing the possibility of primary election as you have confirmed that Adeleke will be your flag bearer in the coming governorship election?\n\nI am talking about my own opinion. We have formidable people in Osun State who can effectively govern the state. We are not going to be divided over matters that are not serious. Southwest is equally as prepared as Osun State for the next elections. We are going to have election that will give us victory in the party. We are very ready to take over power from Governor Isiaka Oyetola. Everybody knows that we were robbed, daylight robbery. This time around, we are ready. I am not saying that we don\u2019t have problems, but we are going to solve those problems. And by the time we solved the problem, we will ensure victory in all elections including the national elections.\n\nHow do you see the preparation of INEC to ensure free, fair and credible elections at all levels?\n\nHonestly speaking, I cannot vouch for INEC. The mere mention of INEC by you raises fundamental fear in me. INEC is never to be trusted until they do things and we see that the things are done well.\n\nWhat is your thought about the state of the nation?\n\nMay God save our country because whether or not we like it, Nigeria belongs to all of us. We must invest in peace, security, unity and progress of the country. I am appealing to the APC to be firm in their mind that they are going to conduct free and credible elections.\n\nThe issue of credible election is far beyond making an appeal to the ruling party for a credible election. Opposition must also do its part by insisting that the right thing is done. How are you doing that?\n\nI can assure you that we will do everything in our power to ensure that we cooperate with anybody who wishes Nigeria well by having free and fair election. And that is why I am appealing to the APC because all these things they are playing by enticing the governors will divide our country. We don\u2019t need it.\n\nWith the President\u2019s assent to the PIB, there is speculation that the pump price of Petroleum may be in the region of N250 to N300. What do you have to say about this?\n\nI wish them the best of luck. But all these contradictions will add up to affirm the opinion of Nigerians that the APC government should be put aside in 2023.\n\nThe issue of state creation was again brought to the fore by the National Assembly even though they have denied it. Do you see the creation of a new state as a solution to the mirage of problems facing the country?\n\nIt cannot be, it will be a terrible distraction. All I know is that by the grace of God, everything will be well because all Nigerians are quite focused on having a proper election devoid of rigging.",

          "title": "APC Chairmanship Battle Hots Up",
          "text": "*Akume, Al-Makura, Shettima, Yari, Adamu, others join race\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAs the All Progressives Congress (APC) prepares for its national convention later in the year, following the nod received from the governors of the ruling party, many aspirants have intensified their lobby to succeed the Chairman of the National Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nProminent among the APC chairmanship aspirants are a two-term governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Abdulaziz Yari; two-term Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura; another two-term governor of the state, Senator Abdullahi Adamu; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; a former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and another former Governor of the state, Senator Kashim Shettima.\n\nA former governorship aspirant in Kwara State, Mr. Salihu Mustapha, is also in the race and is the youngest aspirant, while speculations are rife that a former Governor of Gombe State and senator representing Gombe Central senatorial zone, Senator Danjuma Goje, is also in the race to succeed Buni.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on the Ondo State governorship election, which put a question mark on Buni\u2019s dual role as governor and chairman of the ruling party, coupled with multiple litigations challenging his position, APC governors had given the Buni-led committee a go-ahead to organise the party\u2019s local government and state congresses, as well as national convention.\n\nThe latest in the gale of litigations challenging Buni\u2019s chairmanship of the APC was filed last week by Mr. Samuel Irabor on behalf of 100 members of the party, urging the Federal High Court in Abuja to dissolve the Buni-led 13-member caretaker committee of the APC.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs also told the court that the chairmanship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC Constitution.\n\nIt is also the contention of the plaintiffs that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer Oath of Office to Buni as caretaker chairman of the party.\n\nHowever, despite all the suits challenging the legality of the Yobe State governor\u2019s appointment as the chairman of his party, the APC governors had thrown their weight behind the Buni-led committee to organise the national convention.\n\nThough the ruling party had on many occasions clarified that it had not zoned the presidency and other offices ahead of the 2023 general election, all the aspirants for the party\u2019s chairmanship position are from the North.\n\nThis has rekindled the hope for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the southern part of the country.\n\nYari, a two-time Governor of Zamfara State, had indicated his interest to run for the office of the National Chairman of the APC.\n\nHe had after the completion of his two-term in office as governor in 2019, decided to retire to the Senate Chamber of the National Assembly like most governors do by contesting a senatorial seat.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court judgment which nullified all the elections won by the APC in the state truncated his ambition to retire to the red chamber.\n\nYari is believed to be highly competent and experienced with wide contacts as a former governor and former Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nHowever, his alleged high-handedness in the running of affairs of the APC, while he held sway as the governor of Zamfara State, which ultimately led to the loss of the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic (PDP) is said to be working against his ambition to lead the ruling party.\n\nSimilarly, the emerging political supremacy battle in the state, where he has locked horns with the newly defected governor Bello Matawale is going to be a major setback in his bid to lead the party at the national level.\n\nAPC members have also cited Yari\u2019s alleged consistent intransigence to the resolutions of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee on the leadership of the party in Zamfara State as his albatross.\n\nAlso, his case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged mismanagement of public funds running into billions of Naira, has become a sort of a moral burden on his neck.\n\nAl-Makura is another political heavyweight in the race for the position of the National Chairman of APC.\n\nHe enjoys the advantage of being a former Governor of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) extraction and a serving Senator.\n\nSources within the ruling party said Al-Makura is one of the aspirants to watch due to the strong support he enjoys from the governor of his home state, Mr. Abdullahi Sule, who had publicly declared support for him.\n\nHowever, his recent invitation by the EFCC over alleged mismanagement of multi-billion naira while he held sway as the Governor of Nasarawa State is an obstacle that could ruin his ambition.\n\nParty sources said if the damning evidence presented against him by the petitioners from his home state is anything to go by, then the former governor may as well bid his ambition farewell as it is unlikely that the APC and especially President Muhammadu Buhari would accept anything short of a clean slate from the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nAnother former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, representing Nasarawa West senatorial district is also in the race.\n\nAdamu is also a very competent and experienced politician and first civilian governor of the state.\n\nA former minister and secretary of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Adamu is as influential as any politician could aspire to be, and has been on the corridors of power for decades.\n\nHowever, sources in the APC said his old age is counting against him.\n\nAdamu also has to deal with the opposition at the home front as the governor of the state, Sule has thrown his weight publicly behind Al-Makura, Adamu\u2019s fiercest political rival in the state.\n\nAnother aspirant for the office of the Chairman of APC, Sheriff is an experienced political heavyweight and fighter, who led the PDP during its crisis.\n\nSheriff was elected as a Senator in 1999 on the platform of the All Peoples Party (APP).\n\nIn 2003, he defeated the sitting governor, Mala Kachalla, at the party primaries, and won the election on the platform of All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). It was the APP that changed its name to ANPP.\n\nSheriff was re-elected as governor in 2007.\n\nHe is a founding member of the APC but he defected to the PDP in 2014.\n\nHe later became the national chairman of the PDP after the party lost the 2015 elections. His leadership was however marred by crisis and the party became factionalised.\n\nThe Supreme Court later declared the other factional leader and former Governor of Kaduna State, Mr. Ahmed Makarfi, as the authentic chairman of the PDP. In April 2018, Sheriff returned to the APC.\n\nNo doubt, the former governor of Borno State is a crafty and dogged politician with a very deep pocket to prosecute any political ambition.\n\nHowever, committed APC chieftains are said to be uncomfortable with the alleged \u2018spoiler\u2019 role he played in the PDP and his inconsistency, which makes him switch political parties at will.\n\nHe was also alleged to have sponsored the terrorist group, Boko Haram Islamic sect, an allegation he had dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d.\n\nShettima is another two-term Governor of Borno State and former Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nThese positions he had held may count in his favour as he contests for the chairmanship of the ruling party.\n\nHis cordial relationship with the governor of his home state, Prof. Babagana Zulum, is also an added advantage to his efforts to realise his ambition to lead the APC.\n\nHowever, whatever achievements he recorded as Borno State governor were blighted by the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nMustapha is not only the youngest of the contenders but one of the two in the race who is neither an incumbent nor a former governor or Senator.\n\nNevertheless, the Kwara-born businessman brings to the table a robust experience in party administration that spanned decades.\n\nHe also has a vast political network within the progressive fold.\n\nHe is also a well-known long-term political ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, starting from his days in the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to the days of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), where he served as a Deputy National Chairman under the Tony Momoh-led NWC of the party between 2011 and 2013.\n\nMustapha also has grassroots influence in his home state and a rich network of friends across the country.\n\nMustapha is said to be running a campaign that appeals to both the young and the old members of the party.\n\nCodenamed B.R.I.D.G.E.S, Mustapha\u2019s campaign seeks a return to the party\u2019s founding ideals of progressivism and internal democracy.\n\nHowever, he has never held a top political position like governor or member of the National Assembly and this may count against him.\n\nA former governor of Benue State under the platform of the PDP, Akume is also said to be in the race.\n\nAkume, a two-term governor was re-elected Senator for Benue North-West in the April 2011 elections, on the platform of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nSince he lost the senatorial seat to Senator Emmanuel Yisa Order-Jev of the PDP in the 2019 general election, his political fortunes at the home front have nosedived considerably and this led to a total loss of control of the state by the APC.\n\nBut his experience as a two-term governor, and his current position as a serving minister in President Buhari\u2019s cabinet, will boost his chances.\n\nHowever, APC sources have described him as being \u2018docile\u2019 and \u2018laid back\u2019 in his campaign for the party\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nGoje is also said to be in the APC chairmanship race but his alleged ambition has remained in the realm of speculation.\n\nThe former Gombe State governor and Senator representing Gombe Central had after his victory in the 2019 general election, formally declared that he would not seek any political office again.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves Hit $37bn with $3.5bn New SDRs",
          "text": "* Apex bank threatens to revoke MFBs\u2019 licences over fx transactions\n\n* Seeks labour\u2019s collaboration to grow economy\n\nFestus Akanbi, Kunle Aderinokun, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign reserves will get a timely boost on Monday when the country\u2019s share of $3.5billion from the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to boost global liquidity, matures for collection.\n\nConsequently, the nation\u2019s foreign reserves currently put at $34billion will hit the $37billion threshold, which will boost the capacity of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to fund higher volumes of external transactions and achieve a further convergence of the exchange rate around the I & E window.\n\nThis is coming as the CBN has threatened to revoke the operating licence of any microfinance bank found engaging in foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe apex bank has also urged the organised labour to collaborate with it to grow the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe approval for the SDRs credit was announced by the board of IMF on August 4.\n\nSDRs are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the IMF.\n\nThey are units of account for the IMF and not a currency.\n\nAlso, they represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged. SDRs were created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign exchange reserve assets, namely gold and United States dollars.\n\nManaging Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, who confirmed the maturity of the IMF\u2019s credit to THISDAY yesterday, said: \u201cUpon receipt of the IMF\u2019s SDR credit of $3.35billion expected on August 23, we expect gross external reserves to increase to about $37billion. This will provide more support for the CBN to support the currency and lead to a further convergence of the exchange rate around the I & E window.\u201d\n\nRewane also said in the August edition of the FDC Monthly Update, released during the weekend, that \u201can increase in the gross external reserves will support the CBN\u2019s intervention at the foreign exchange markets and help in the convergence of the parallel market rate towards the rate at the I&E window.\n\n\u201cIn the first fortnight of August, Nigeria\u2019s gross external reserves maintained a steady accretion. The reserves gained 0.30 per cent to $33.58billion (August 13). The cumulative gain as of August 13 is $180million. At $33.58billion, the reserves level is sufficient to cover 8.24 months.\n\n\u201cWe expect the CBN\u2019s increase in forex supply to commercial banks to support the exchange rate for invisibles in the near term and ultimately, close the gap between the parallel and official rates (N104/$ as of August 13). Similarly, we expect the $3.35billion IMF SDR allocation to increase the external reserves level to about $37billion and support the CBN\u2019s intervention in the forex market,\u201d Rewane explained.\n\nAbout $275 billion (193 billion SDRs ) of the new allocation would go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nThe economic research firm projected additional foreign exchange accretion through the anticipated rise in higher oil revenue in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe expect the increase in Nigeria\u2019s domestic oil production to be sustained in the coming months barring any disruptions,\u201d the FDC report stated.\n\nIt added that: \u201cAn increase in oil production will offset the fall in oil prices and this will lead to higher oil revenue. This will impact positively on the fiscal and external balances of the country.\u201d\n\nFDC quoted the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) monthly oil report as stating that Nigeria\u2019s domestic oil production increased by 3.60 per cent (45,000 barrels per day) to 1.44mbpd in July from 1.39mbpd in June. This, according to the report, is 22.58 per cent below the benchmark of 1.86mbpd.\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil rig count had increased by 40 per cent from five to seven in June.\n\nConsequently, the company expects oil prices to remain soft in the near term due to the surge in Covid-19 cases globally.\n\nFDC stated, \u201cChina, a major importer of oil, recently imposed lockdown measures. This will dampen its oil demand prospects and weigh on the oil price. We expect oil prices to stay within the $70 per barrel- $74pb range.\u201d\n\nIt explained that although lower oil prices and the attendant reduction in oil earnings cannot be ruled out, the government\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery will be the saving grace.\n\n\u201cOil accounts for 86 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings and contributes approximately 10 per cent to GDP. Lower oil prices coupled with Nigeria\u2019s low oil production would lead to reduced oil earnings and government revenue.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in the Dangote Refinery, which is projected to be the largest single-plant in the world, guarantees a steady supply of crude to the refinery and will boost the NNPC\u2019s revenue. In addition, the Kaduna and Warri refineries will undergo rehabilitation and complement the Dangote refinery. Nigeria could be on its way to being becoming a regional oil hub,\u201d the report added.\n\nCBN Threatens to Revoke MFBs\u2019 Licences over Fx Transactions\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN has threatened to revoke the operating licence of any microfinance bank (MFB) found engaging in foreign exchange transactions.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, some of the MFBs had been engaging in activities beyond the remit of their licences as they dealt in foreign exchange transactions and practised wholesale banking, considered as non-permissible activities for micro banking institutions.\n\nThe CBN, which read this riot act in a \u2018Circular to All Microfinance Banks\u2019 with reference: FPRD/DIR/PUB/CIR/01/020, dated August 19, 2021, cautioned that acting outside beyond their mandates with comparatively low capitalisation, posed a significant risk with dire consequences for financial system stability.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has observed the activities of some Microfinance Banks (MFBs) that have gone beyond the remit of their operating licences by engaging in non-permissible activities, especially wholesale banking, foreign exchange transactions, and others.\n\n\u201cGiven the comparatively low capitalisation of MFBs, dealing in wholesale and /or foreign exchange transaction is a significant risk with dire consequences for financial system stability,\u201d the circular stated.\n\nThe CBN, in the circular, titled, \u2018Cessation of Non-Permissible Activities by Microfinance Banks\u2019, signed by Deputy Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department, CBN, Mr. Ibrahim S. Tukur, reminded all MFBs to strictly comply with the extant Revised Regulatory and Supervisory Guidelines for Microfinance Banks in Nigeria 2012.\n\nStating that it would continue to monitor developments in the MFB sector, it stressed that it would apply severe regulatory sanctions for breaches of extant regulations including revoking the licence of non-compliant MFBs (in line with Section 19 of the Guidelines).\n\nAccording to Section 19 of the Guidelines: \u201cThe grounds for revoking a licence granted to an MFB may be any or all of the following: (a) Submission of false information/data during and/or after the processing of the application for licence; (b) The use of proxies or disguised names to obtain a licence to operate as an MFB; (C) Engaging in functions/activities outside the permissible scope of its licence as specified in Section 2.2 of these guidelines; (d) Persistent failure to comply with request for information/data in the form required/specified by the CBN; (e) Engaging in activities prejudicial to the Nigerian economy; (f) Failure to redeem matured obligations to customers; (g) Failure to render statutory monthly returns for a continuous period of six months or for a cumulative period of six months in a financial year; (h) Unauthorised shop closure; (i), Failure to comply with any directive issued by the CBN; (j) Engaging in prohibited activities as listed in these Guidelines; (k) Technical insolvency, that is, where an MFB\u2019s assets are insufficient to cover its liabilities; (i) Such other conditions applicable to banks and other financial institutions which constitute a ground for revocation of licence under the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 1991(as amended); and (m) any other act(s) which in the opinion of the CBN constitute(s) a violation or a serious default.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank, however, stated for the record, the permissible activities of specialised micro-institutions. \u201cMFBs are strictly prohibited from foreign exchange transactions; MFBs are to primarily focus on providing financial services to retail and/or micro-clients; Microcredit and retail transactions carried out by MFBs are limited to N500,000 per transaction for Tier 2 Unit MFBs and N1,000,000 per transaction for other categories; Micro-credit facilities shall constitute a minimum of 80 per cent of total loans portfolio for MFBs,\u201d it pointed out.\n\nThe latest CBN circular came on the heels of measures it had taken in recent times to save the value of the naira and maintain its integrity.\n\nAbout a month ago, it suspended forex allocations to bureau de change (BDC) operators.\n\nAs soon it cut off direct supply to the BDCs, it released $200 million to the commercial banks and has continued to serve them forex liquidity, weekly.\n\nThis was part of efforts to meet dollar demand for legitimate end-users in the country.\n\nBut not too long after, some of the banks (though names undisclosed), were indicted for round-tripping.\n\nThey were accused of flouting the forex rules by actively conniving with unscrupulous customers to defraud the system.\n\nThis set of customers and banks were, however, threatened with stiff sanctions by the banking regulator. The threat came after the 357th Bankers Committee meeting, which was held virtually, recently.\n\nThe bank CEOs, who reported the unwholesome practices by the banks and customers, noted they would adopt digital means to detect fraud in the forex system. Managing Director of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Yemisi Edun, and Group Managing Director of Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), Segun Agbaje, spoke on behalf of the banks. The Bankers Committee membership, which comprises banks\u2019 CEOs and CBN directors, has the CBN governor as its chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking yesterday in Lagos on the sidelines of the one-day interactive enlightenment session with organised labour and civil society on the CBN\u2019s five-year policy thrust, the apex bank\u2019s acting Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, called on the labour to collaborate with it for inclusive growth across the economy.\n\nWhile giving clarity on the circular issued on MFBs, he emphasised that the practices by some MFBs pose significant risks to the banking system.\n\nHe also called on the labour to collaborate with the CBN to grow the economy.\n\nNwanisobi said: \u201cThe CBN alone cannot bear with all of the issues in the Nigerian economy and we believe that it is important that every Nigerian key into the reality that we need to grow our economy. It is not just about the CBN or the Nigerian government; it is about the Nigerian people and we believe that the labour, being a significant stakeholder group, would be able to take this message to their people.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on labour and everyone to support the interventions by the CBN as these policies of the CBN are to grow the economy sustainably so we can see how to get inflation to single digits.\n\n\u201cOur interventions are very well thought-out; it is not something that comes out of the curve; we sit down to think through these interventions before we get it out to the public and the whole essence is to grow the real economy sustainably,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nThe 37-year-old, Utienyinoritsetsola Emiko was yesterday crowned as the 21st Olu of Warri at Ode Itsekiri, the ancestral home of Iwere people in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nThe new Oba was crowned at exactly 3.28 p.m. at a colourful ceremony attended by dignitaries from across the globe.\n\nThe 21st Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III, has also reversed an ancestral curse placed on Nigeria by his grandfather, Olu Erejuwa II, as a result of alleged injustice meted out to him.\n\nErejuwa II was Olu of Warri from 1951 to 1964 and from 1966 to 1986.\n\nHe was the 18th Olu of Warri Kingdom with the title: Ogiame Erejuwa II.\n\nThe new Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III, yesterday reversed his grandfather\u2019s curse during his coronation.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs the spiritual, cultural, political, and traditional ruler of this land, I, Ogiame Atuwatse III, the 21st Olu of Warri, the first son of Olu Atuwatse II, the grandson of and direct descendant of Olu Erejuwa II, who was offended on this throne, hereby reverse the curse placed over this land.\n\n\u201cIn its place, I release forgiveness and healing to the Federal Government of Nigeria whose might was used to propagate that offence; and I decree unprecedented and an uncommon peace, prosperity, progress, and development upon this land.\n\n\u201cI bring down the government of heaven unto this land and I direct it to flow as a course that can neither be sabotaged nor slowed, stopped.\n\n\u201cIt goes out as a strong ripple effect emanating from this kingdom to the rest of the Niger Delta, to the rest of the Nigerian nation, and even to the African continent.\u201d\n\nDeputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, and Minister of State, Labour, and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN), represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the event.\n\nDeputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon.

          "title": "Explained: Can the Nigerian government really spy on your WhatsApp messages?",
          "text": "Barely a month after blocking access to Twitter, the Nigerian government allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) for a \u201cWhatsApp Intercept Solution\u201d.\n\nAn interception solution for WhatsApp would allow an external party (the government, in this case) to access, monitor, or block communications (calls and chats) carried out by users via the app.\n\nThe move is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigeria from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms. However, it is seen by media stakeholders and activists as yet another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nHowever, some uncertainty hangs over how Nigerian authorities plan to go about intercepting WhatsApp, particularly because the platform uses end-to-end encryption for its messages. TechCabal examines the possibility of such interception and technical intricacies involved.\n\nWhat is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a technology that ensures chats can only be read by the sender and recipient and not intercepted by a middleman. Messages are scrambled when they leave the sender\u2019s device and can be decoded only by the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nWhatsApp uses the popular Signal encryption protocol that involves exchanging unique security keys that are verified between users, to avoid any kind of interception by a middle person.\n\nWhatever is said between users with WhatsApp is guaranteed to be private during transmission.\n\nAccording to a cybersecurity expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, intercepting this flow of messages during transit across the internet is near-impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible. The government would have to force every WhatsApp user in Nigeria to use a particular security key,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somehow it\u2019s pulled off and some messages are accessed, the encryption makes it much harder, if not impossible, to read them.\u201d\n\nHowever, an interception is possible if there\u2019s a vulnerability in the implementation of the encryption system and that\u2019s one problem with WhatsApp\u2019s security.\n\nBreaking down the WhatsApp encryption\n\nOn WhatsApp, new encryption keys are generated for users who log in with a new device, and messages that were in transit to them while offline get re-encrypted and resent automatically.\n\nThe sender does not get an opportunity to stop the messages from being resent nor to verify the recipient.\n\nBy forcing users to change security keys without informing them, WhatsApp\u2019s encryption can be circumvented and a third party could spy on messages without the app knowing, a security researcher found in 2017.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn a situation where a WhatsApp user\u2019s sim card was stolen and put in another phone, this re-encryption of messages could allow a third party to intercept and read previously undelivered chats.\n\nBut the security threats from the design, which is meant to make WhatsApp more convenient to use, are small and unlikely to affect most users. In most cases, it would work for potential targeting of individuals, and not mass surveillance, like the Nigerian government probably intends to do.\n\nTo fix the issue, a sender can activate security notification settings in the WhatsApp app and would be informed whenever the recipient\u2019s key changes.\n\nOpen the app and go to the Settings menu. In there, click Account and then Security. The page has just one option: \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d \u2013 turn on that option and the app will send an alert every time the security key changes.\n\nStorage loopholes\n\nThere are also vulnerabilities with how WhatsApp messages are stored, which could be exploited by hackers.\n\nWhatsApp chats are saved in four locations, from where data can be retrieved later. These include the phone memories of both the sender and receiver, WhatsApp\u2019s server, and on the cloud, depending on if a user allowed it in the app\u2019s settings.\n\nSpyware dropped on the phone of either the sender or receiver could read the messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. On a few occasions, hackers and government agencies have been alleged to use spyware for decrypted messages on targeted phones.\n\nAn instance is the hacking of several WhatsApp accounts in 2019 by the Pegasus remote surveillance software made by Israel-based cyber tech firm, NSO. Ex-Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, saw his phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message purportedly sent by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe cloud backup of messages can also be hacked. In the case of WhatsApp, users get the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but the copies aren\u2019t protected by the end-to-end encryption. Hence, an attacker could access old chats if they hack into a cloud storage account.\n\nOn national security grounds, the Nigerian government could approach WhatsApp to request access to certain information stored on its servers but not chats because that violates privacy laws, the expert said.\n\nChat platforms often don\u2019t store messages on their servers. WhatsApp claims it only does so if chats cannot be delivered immediately \u2013 for example, in instances where the receiver is offline, the sender\u2019s messages are kept on the server for 30 days. Once they\u2019re delivered, Whatsapp deletes the messages from the server.\n\nWhatsApp has repeatedly said that with end-to-end encryption, only both parties in the conversation and nobody in between, not even the company itself, can decode what\u2019s sent. Thus, it has often expressed helplessness to law enforcement agencies pressing for access to private messages, in countries like India.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhatsApp Messenger enjoys a reputation of confidentiality but even encryption has its vulnerabilities.\n\nIn theory, any device or service is susceptible to hackers, but encryption technology offers protection in most cases and WhatsApp is often quick to issue updates including security fixes.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the Nigerian government intends to go about tracking WhatsApp messages after earmarking billions of naira for the said interception solution.\n\nWith over 90 million Nigerian users per data from Statista, WhatsApp is the most popular social media platform used in the country. Any attempt to tamper with the application would thus affect a massive number of people.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit.

I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

The demise of one of Nigeria\u2019s finest military officers is a painful loss to our state and the country.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to remember the late General for his meritorious service to his fatherland as well as statesmanship. He shall be sorely missed not only by his family and kinsmen in Ilaro, but the entire people Ogun, and by extension Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI pray the Almighty God rest his soul, forgive his shortcomings and grant his family members fortitude to bear this irreplaceable loss\u201d.

Rev. Msgr. Peter Nworie Chukwu as the 3rd Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Abakaliki on Thursday, August 19, 2021, Governor Umahi had announced the handing over of the King David University of Medical Sciences Uburu to the Catholic Bishops Conference for what he called \u201coptimum management and academic excellence.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs reported via a statement made available through his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Francis Nwaze, the governor declared, \u201cThe contributions of the church to the Educational Development of Nigeria is unparalleled and for this, I, on-behalf of the State wish to give the King David University of Medical Sciences Uburu to the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria to own and run.\u201d\n\nBut, reacting through a statement signed by AESID president, Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, on Sunday, the Ebonyi indigenes wondered how a governor would make such pronouncement \u201cwhich is capable of not only pitching the mother church against her sister Presbyterian Church which has been in court challenging the forceful takeover of the said property but also further negate the provisions of our extant Laws, create chaos and confusion and deepen animosity between the Christian faith even as we yet see Ebonyi as a secular State only dominated by the Christian religion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, in public\u2019s best interest, no law permits a governor to build such a massive edifice with millions of unaccounted public funds and hand same over to a people of a particular faith in a multi-religious society like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cApart from the severe breaches of the law typified by the non-passage of any Law enabling the donation of the said institution which was built with public funds, unaudited and unaccounted for by the Ebonyi State\u2019s House of Assembly \u2013 an ordinarily third arm of government that has been serially amputated and utterly neglected by the Governor, Umahi has by this pronouncement shown that he\u2019s merely a desperate dealer trying to cover-up his suspected dirty tracks by currying the favour of the largest and most populous Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cNo one, we repeat, no church or organisation for that matter therefore should accept any such compromised dealings from a Governor like Umahi. For we are certain that his motives on this particular offer are as ulterior as the majority of his dealings with Ebonyi people in his past six year\u2019s on the saddle as Ebonyi Governor,\u201d he said.\n\nStating the controversies on the said Uburu varsity, the statement further said: \u201cFirst, the Presbyterian Church had alerted the general public that, on Friday, the 12th of July, 2019, it received a hint that the Ebonyi State exco approved Government takeover of the Presbyterian Joint Hospital, Uburu.\n\n\u201cAlso announced on the same day on the state broadcast network, was the award of contracts for the construction of several blocks of buildings for the Ebonyi State Teaching Hospital on property the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria holds on lease and has developed over 107 years as the Presbyterian Joint Hospital, Uburu.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that Umahi had sent a letter asking for approval to the State\u2019s House of Assembly asking for the State\u2019s takeover and acquisition of the oldest Hospital founded by a Missionary, Dr. John Hitchcock which his lackeys in the said arm of government readily granted without any due diligence or investigation, the head of Information Department and Public Affairs of the Presbyterian Church, Rt. Rev. Nnoke Ibe had in a detailed Press release accused the State Governor of forcefully taking over the hospital for which it still paid rents to the family and village donors of the land upon which it is situated.\n\n\u201cThe release, made since July 2020 had asserted without a counter-claim from the Umahi-led government that, \u2018The Church is also aware that the Government\u2019s power of eminent domain confers a power to take land it requires for public purposes; but that power is made constitutionally subject to procedures which guarantee the rights, privileges and entitlements of occupiers and holders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled the Presbyterian Church release also stating, \u201cThat now that Government is aware that the Hospital is a property of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, the Government should act in line with constitutional provisions to ensure that persons entitled to occupation of the property are given their legal entitlements; That though we are aware of our constitutional rights as a Church on this issue, the long-standing good relationship between the Church and Government, compel the Church to implore Ebonyi State Government to create a conducive platform for amicable resolution of the issues involved.\u201d\n\nWhile condemning the what it called the governor\u2019s \u201cinsensitive act,\u201d the statement said: \u201cwe haven\u2019t also forgotten that the plan was actually to acquire and build the said institution as the new State\u2019s University medical school.

From where and how then can the Catholic community fund, maintain and sustain such academic institution which could become a monumental waste if not properly-funded?\n\n\u201cIf truly Umahi loves and wants academic excellence, why has he proposed the above monumental fee regime in a poor state like ours? Why has he also totally neglected the public education sector in Ebonyi without reasonable grants to the existing state-owned Primary, Secondary and especially, tertiary institutions in the State?\n\n\u201cFinally, AESID joins the rest of saner Ebonyians to kindly reject the offer and focus on fulfilling its spiritual and religious goals for the Church even as we wish the newly-ordained Bishop a successful Episcopal reign filled with great wisdom to handle the affairs of the mother church.\n\n\u201cAnd for Umahi, he should await his days of reckoning with the antitrust agencies for all his lawless actions, misconducts and unaccountability in governance which has made Ebonyi remain the poverty capital of the entire Southern Nigeria.\u201d",

          "summary": "The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora (AESID) has rejected the donation of King David University of Medical Sciences Uburu, Ebonyi State, which it described as \u201cGreek offer\u201d by the state governor, Dave Umahi, to the Catholic Church.\nThe group said if the situation is not properly managed, it could lead to animosity between the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, who had claimed ownership of the new varsity and the Catholic Church.\n\u201cNo one, we repeat, no church or organisation for that matter therefore should accept any such compromised dealings from a Governor like Umahi.\nFor we are certain that his motives on this particular offer are as ulterior as the majority of his dealings with Ebonyi people in his past six year\u2019s on the saddle as Ebonyi Governor,\u201d he said.\nStating the controversies on the said Uburu varsity, the statement further said: \u201cFirst, the Presbyterian Church had alerted the general public that, on Friday, the 12th of July, 2019, it received a hint that the Ebonyi State exco approved Government takeover of the Presbyterian Joint Hospital, Uburu.",

I encourage you to tell the truth as a mother and a Christian, to put the devil to shame and save millions of souls being misled. To my family and friends, I am sorry, don\u2019t judge me. Please pray for me so the light of God will continue to expose every work of darkness in my life and the church of God.\u201d\n\nIn a video obtained by SaharaReporters, Chioma noted that her public confession came after her spirit continued to torment her, and she needed to make restitution for her sin.\n\nWATCH: I Slept With @ApostleSuleman Twice and He paid Me N500k For Hookups \u00e2\u0080\u0094Nollywood Actress, Chioma Ifemeludike Opens Up On \u2018Tormenting Experience\u2019 With Pastor At Oriental Hotel In Lagos\n\nFULL VIDEO: https://t.co/eSrTgw8giE\n\n\u201cGood morning Nigerians. I have a confession. On the 20th of November 2016, Linda made an arrangement for me to come to Ikeja and that we\u2019re going to meet her sister\u2019s friend, and a family friend going to America.\n\n\u201cThat was what she told me. Okay, so it was supposed to be a hookup. But it wasn\u2019t really exactly put like that. Well, she told me that a family friend of hers wanted to meet someone nice and cool. And that he was going to America that same night and that he wasn\u2019t going to waste much time and he wanted me to meet that person. And I said fine.\n\n\u201c2016 was immediately after my graduation from Anambra State University, I was preparing for my youth service,\u201d she stated.\n\nAs it was also reported in February 2021 that a former pastor of the Omega Fire Ministries, Mike Davids, accused Suleman, of sleeping with his wife.\n\nHe had added he was ready to expose the truths behind Stephanie Otobo\u2019s sex scandal.\n\nThe case of Otobo, a Canada-based singer, came up in 2017 and 2018 when she accused Suleman of sexual relationship \u2013 a controversial scandal that plagued the church and attracted the attention of Nigerians for months.\n\nDavids in a video had noted that he and Suleman both knew how they got Otobo to come to the church in Auchi, and apologise over the scandal and how they persuaded her mother too. Davids had accused Suleman of sleeping with his wife, Faith Edeko, who currently heads an Abuja branch of the church.\n\nHe had said, \u201cI left the church (Omega Fire Ministries) of my freewill. You were never the one who sent me out of that ministry. I was tired of your ungodliness as a leader. And that was the major reason I left that ministry. So, forget those manipulations and cheap lies.\n\n\u201cWe all know the part I played in the Stephanie Otobo saga. You know as much as I do. How much involved I was in bringing that saga to a halt. I don\u2019t even need to mention names. You knew how we got Stephanie Otobo to come to the altar and apologise to mama (Suleman\u2019s wife) and brought Stephanie Otobo\u2019s mother to Auchi.\n\n\u201cI am coming to that issue because you are pushing me to that extent, Apostle Johnson Suleman as much as I knew what happened. Thirdly, I am also aware that my account has been frozen. You have also released policemen to get me arrested.\n\n\u201cYou have 48 hours to ask those who are blocking my account to unblock it. You will not like what is going to follow.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Otobo accused Suleman of impregnating her and breaching a promise to marry her.\n\nShe claimed she had sex romps with the pastor in Italy, New York and Nigeria.",

          "text": "As permutations for the 2023 presidential race continues to gather momentum, posters with pictures of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje have flooded the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe posters were sponsored by a support ground called the \u201cOsinbajo-Ganduje Alliance\u201d.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cOsinbajo-Ganduje Alliance (OGA), For Better Nigeria OGA Na Master.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by Messrs Oluleke Mose and Bello Adamu Mohammed of the Osinbajo Ganduje Alliance support group says, \u201cVice President Osinbajo and Governor Ganduje have both offered the most plausible solutions to ending the security crisis occasioned by the farmers-herders crisis across the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if power rotates to the South, Osinbajo is best placed to unite, heal and inspire our great nation. We also firmly believe that Ganduje\u2019s antecedents as Governor of Kano make him the perfect Northern vice presidential candidate to Osinbajo; one who will advance and protect the interests of a Northern Nigeria plagued by poverty and insecurity.\u201d\n\nMost political pundits believe that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is quietly nursing a Presidential ambition, while Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, whose tenure ends in 2023, has publicly expressed his support for a Southern President.\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) i s most likely to zone its Presidential candidate to the South of Nigeria, after eight years of Buhari and based on a purported gentleman understanding reached between the founding members of APC in 2014.\n\nKano in North West Nigeria is renowned for its politics, and boasts of the largest voter turn-out figures in Nigeria. Lagos, Osinbajo\u2019s political alma mater, has arguably become the hub of political influence and activity in the South of Nigeria.\n\nAs concerns around Tinubu\u2019s health and age have grown, there is mounting opposition to Tinubu\u2019s ambition within the APC; and more politicians and pundits in the South are beginning to talk and play up the prospects of younger Turks within the APC like Prof. Osinbajo, Gov. Kayode Fayemi and the former governor of Lagos Babatunde Fashola (SAN).\n\nGov. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, a PhD holder in Public Administration who served then defeated his erstwhile political godfather Gov. Rabiu Kwankwaso, belongs to a moderate group in the APC and North that believes the next President of Nigeria should come from the South.\n\nPairing a sitting Vice President from the second largest voting zone in Nigeria with a governor from the largest voting zone in the country could be a political masterstroke for votes in 2023.\n\nHowever, as the APC appears to have conceded that power rotates to the south, and as consensus grows around Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy, it is anticipated that the contest for the Vice presidential slot amongst Northern APC politicians will start to assume center stage.\n\nDespite the fact that the campaign posters are very conspicuous in public places near the presidential villa, no official reactions have come from the Vice President\u2019s or Governor\u2019s offices.",

The trafficker voided 68 wraps of heroin in three excretions totaling 800 grams while under observation at the Agency\u2019s facilities on Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th August 2021.\n\nSimilarly, narcotic officers from the Directorate of Operation and General Investigation intercepted at two courier companies in Lagos 840 grams of methamphetamine bound for Australia and concealed in bolts; 340 grams of meth concealed in locally made footwear bound for Australia; and 1 kilogram of cocaine bound for the United Kingdom and concealed in four local guitars.\n\nAnother 480grams of Meth, concealed in footwear and bound for Australia, was also recovered from one of the courier companies.\n\nMeanwhile, a South African returnee, Obi Chigozie Samuel, was caught last Sunday at the Lagos airport during Ethiopian Airlines\u2019 inward clearance from Addis-Abeba, for bringing 58 grams of skunk into Nigeria. During the preliminary interview, he admitted to owning cannabis and claiming to be a cannabis smoker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn strings of operations in Edo, Ondo, Kaduna, Kano and Kogi states, at least 2,504.8 kilograms of diverse illicit drugs were seized from multiple suspects in the past week. In Kogi, 60-year-old Mrs Comfort Uzor was arrested with 62.1kg cannabis on Tuesday, 17th August, 2021 in Lokoja, where one Dayyabu Usman was also caught with 8kg of same substance. While Uzor sourced hers from Bolorunduro in Ondo state and was heading to Abuja, Usman got his from Lagos and was taking it to Kano for sale.\n\nIn Kaduna state, operatives of the Birnin Gwari Area Command of the Agency raided the home of one Mr Joseph Sunday at Ungwa Pama, Kaduna where they recovered 48.3kg of cannabis from his room following credible intelligence.\n\nIn Edo state, NDLEA officers on Tuesday 17th August stormed the Ugbuwe forest in Ovia North East LGA, where they seized146 bags of cannabis sativa weighing 2,044 kilograms, while in Kano state, one Ikechukwu Aleke was arrested with 30,000 tablets of Tramadol 225mg and 99 bottles of Codeine syrup, in addition to the arrest of one Muktar Muhammad, with 370 bottles of Codeine cough syrup, weighing 60.4kg, as well as 900 tablets of Rohypnol.

Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) commended the officers and men of the various commands for their unrelenting commitment to the presidential mandate to clear Nigerian forests and communities of illicit drugs in whatever form. \u201cWe have all laid our hands on the plough, there\u2019s no looking back, no retreat or surrender and as such I urge all our officers and men to intensify the ongoing offensive action until the last gram of illicit drug is taken away from merchants of death\u201d, Gen. Marwa stated on Sunday.",

          "text": "The Israeli military has launched air raids on Gaza following clashes between its soldiers and Palestinian protesters during a demonstration to commemorate the burning of Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque 52 years ago.\n\nIn a statement late on Saturday, the Israeli military said it struck four weapons manufacturing and storage sites in Gaza belonging to Hamas, the group that governs the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe raids came hours after Israeli soldiers opened fire on crowds of young Palestinians protesting at the fence separating Gaza and Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said dozens of people were wounded, including a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot in the head.\n\n\u201cForty-one civilians were wounded with various injuries,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military called the protesters \u201crioters\u201d and said some had tried to climb the border fence and hurled \u201cexplosive devices\u201d at its soldiers.\n\nThe military said it \u201cresponded with riot dispersal means, including when necessary live fire\u201d and added that an Israeli soldier was \u201ccritically injured by live fire emanating from Gaza\u201d.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Youmna al-Sayed said at least 10 of the Palestinians wounded were children and two were in a critical condition.\n\nShe said Palestinian factions had urged a peaceful commemoration ahead of the demonstration, while \u201cHamas called out the Israeli occupation forces\u2019 excessive force against unarmed civilians as a regular thing Israel is used to\u201d.\n\nThe group also \u201csaid the Palestinians will continue to send messages that they will not allow the Israeli forces to continue imposing the siege on the Gaza Strip and its people\u201d, she added.\n\nLate on Saturday, Hamas and other groups in Gaza issued a joint statement in which they \u201csaluted the heroic youth\u201d who clashed with Israeli forces.\n\nThe violence was some of the worst since a deadly assault by Israel on the Gaza Strip in May.\n\nOver 11 days that month, Israel pounded Gaza with air attacks in response to rocket fire from the enclave. Hamas and other groups said they took action after Israeli forces violently stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound several times, including on the holiest night of Ramadan.\n\nAt least 260 Palestinians, including 67 children, and 13 Israelis were killed in the fighting.\n\nThe conflict ended with a ceasefire on May 21 but reconstruction in Gaza has stalled, in part because of a crippling blockade Israel has maintained on the enclave since Hamas seized power in 2007.\n\nThe new Israeli government, headed by Naftali Bennett, has blocked aid from Qatar, calling for a mechanism to ensure Hamas does not benefit from the cash. It has also blocked the import of key reconstruction materials while demanding that Hamas first return the remains of two soldiers killed in a 2014 war and two Israeli civilians believed to be alive.\n\nOn Thursday, however, Israel announced an agreement with Qatar to resume aid payments to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, the funds are to be transferred by the UN directly to Gaza families, while giving Israel oversight over the list of recipients. The payments are expected to begin in the coming weeks.",

          "text": "Nigeria and other developing oil-producing nations have continued their efforts to discover more hydrocarbons, despite the global campaign against fossil fuels, especially as the world races against net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nDespite the move led by the United States, which is pressuring other developed countries to ramp up their search for renewable and cleaner-burning fuels, resource-dependent countries like Nigeria are devoting more funding for its exploration for the commodity.\n\nApart from Nigeria, other countries like Brazil, Ghana, Guyana, and Suriname, at the just concluded Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston, Texas, United States, laid out agenda for massive oil and gas discoveries that could reshape their economies, if they can get them to market before values erode.\n\nWhile this year\u2019s Houston conference showcased cleaner fuels and the urgency of emissions reduction, accentuating low-carbon tech, offshore wind, and clean-burning hydrogen, Nigeria has insisted that it will continue to take full advantage of its hydrocarbons as the country\u2019s energy needs and the developed world\u2019s sharply contrast.\n\nNigeria is currently deploying 30 per cent of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profit oil and gas to prospecting for oil and gas in the frontier basins as the federal government recently said it won\u2019t allow the country\u2019s barrels to waste.\n\nThe country is proposing this investment although the much-talked energy transition is gaining momentum.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, while responding to the global pressure, had noted that Nigeria does not have enough resources to join the race to renewable energy any time soon.\n\n\u201cWe are not really in the race to renewables as a country and even as a continent, we are not very much in the race to renewable. Let\u2019s look at where we have our comparative advantage.\n\n\u201cOur comparative advantage today as far as energy is concerned is the area of oil and gas. \u201cWe have a lot of gas in this territory, unfortunately, we have not focused on gas, and gas is considered to be a cleaner fuel.\n\n\u201cSome people have begun to discuss gas not as a transition fuel, but as a destination fuel. So, it is also considered a renewable fuel. \u201cWhat we are doing in PIB is to move the focus from oil to gas,\u201d he posited.\n\nHe maintained that the international community cannot \u2018pigeon-hole\u2019 Nigeria into an area that it doesn\u2019t have much strength, stressing that as a country, Nigeria will concentrate on gas production.\n\nSpeaking at the Houston conference, Ghana Energy Minister, Matthew Prempeh, noted that Africa was impoverished in terms of energy supply, explaining that the continent couldn\u2019t abandon its resources, according to a report by Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe have millions of people without electricity in Africa. Energy transition does not mean we\u2019ll see our resources unexploited,\u201d he stated.\n\nFestus Akanbi, Kunle Aderinokun, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, and James Emejo in Abuja",
