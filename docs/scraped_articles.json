Then one morning, I was at home when I heard a loud noise in the community and when I dashed out, I saw children and teachers running, that was when I was told that the roof of the building had come down on them, luckily, no one was hurt.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are now managing the remaining four classroom blocks built by Delta State Oil- Producing Areas Development Commission, DESOPADEC, we now put pupils in the same classroom not minding their class.

Sometimes, it is not always possible, with no communication to reach out to anybody, the two or three nominated ones just sit at the outskirts of the town waiting and hoping a motorcycle rider comes through the bush path and we negotiate.\u201d\n\nContractor said no cash from NDDC \u2013Akpomieman, youth leader\n\nYouth leader, Kingdom Akpomieman, said the community had sent a delegation to the road project contractor, who responded that NDDC was yet to release funds for commencement of work.\n\n\n\nAkpomieman called on NDDC and President Muhammadu Buhari to help the community, saying: \u201cWe want the contractor back to site to complete this project so that we can at least go out of our community and see the world.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Gabriel Olawale\n\nSixty percent of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the British government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.\n\nAccording to reports, the development comes as figures show most regions of England now have more coronavirus patients in hospital than at any point since mid-March.\n\nSpeaking at a Downing Street news briefing on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance said: \u201cIn terms of the number of people in the hospital who\u2019ve been double-vaccinated, we know it\u2019s around 60 percent of the people being admitted to hospital with COVID.\n\n\u201cWe do expect there to be over 1,000 people per day being hospitalised with coronavirus because of the increase in infections. But the rates should be lower than they have been previously because of the protective effects of vaccination.\u201d\n\nHe said this was not surprising \u201cbecause the vaccines are not 100 percent effective\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very, very effective, but not 100 percent, and as a higher proportion of the population is double-vaccinated, it\u2019s inevitable that those 10 percent of that very large number remain at risk, and therefore will be amongst the people who both catch the infection and end up in hospital.\u201d Meanwhile, most regions of England now have more coronavirus patients in hospital than at any point since mid-March.\n\nTwo regions \u2013 south-west England and the combined area of north-east England and Yorkshire \u2013 are back to levels last seen more than four months ago.\n\nFor England as a whole, there are now 3,813 patients in hospital with COVID-19 \u2013 the highest number since 24 March. Sir Patrick also warned said there were \u201chigh levels of COVID and they are increasing\u201d.\n\nHe said the UK was quite close to the previous \u201cwinter wave\u201d of infections.\n\n\u201cIn the winter wave, we were up to around 60,000 people testing positive per day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are now somewhere on towards 50,000. So we\u2019re quite close to the size of the winter wave of infections and this is going to increase.\u201d\n\nthe outset, there is something like 50,000 or near 50,000 cases per day, or positives per day, at the moment being detected \u2013 with a doubling time of 11 days, you can see that that gets to pretty high numbers very quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd another doubling time will take you to even higher numbers, of course \u2013 that would be really quite, quite worrying. So we would like to see some flattening of this, some decrease in the trajectory, and ideally, as you rightly say, you\u2019d like to see this coming down by September, as return of schools would add another pressure on top of that.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam added the uncertainty would be \u201cdriven by human behaviour over the next four to six weeks\u201d.\n\nSubscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\nHe said: \u201cSo really, it is kind of in everybody\u2019s hands, yours and mine.\n\n\u201cIf we are gradual and cautious, and we don\u2019t tear the pants out of this just because we\u2019re glad to have our full freedoms back, then we will materially affect the size and shape of the remainder of this epidemic curve and where the peak occurs, and how big it is.\n\n\u201cIt is literally in the hands of the public, in terms of the behaviours.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "3rd wave: Declare red alert nationwide, all states at risk, scientists tell FG",
          "text": "Call for reactivation of response programme nationwide\n\nBy Sola Ogundipe, Chioma Obinna & Gabriel Olawale\n\nNigerian scientists and public health experts on Monday described the Federal government\u2019s declaration of red alert in six states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja, as \u201ctypical short-sightedness and failure to be proactive\u201d, insisting that all states in Nigeria are at risk and should be put on red alert.\n\nOn Sunday, in the wake of the confirmation of the Delta variant and the rising number of infections and hospitalisation in the country, the federal government placed Lagos, Oyo, Rivers, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, and the FCT on red alert as part of its preventive measures against the virulent third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn separate chats, the medical experts who also called for the reactivation of COVID-19 response activities nationwide urged the government to be more proactive in its response to the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking with Good Health Weekly, a renowned virologist and former President, Nigeria Academy of Science, NAS, Prof Oyewale Tomori said the whole of Nigeria, not just selected states, is at risk and should be on red alert.\n\n\u201cCOVID goes where we take it. From Ikotun Egbe to Oba Ndemili South or North, the entire country should be on alert,\u201d Tomori remarked.\n\nHe said after the Sallah holidays and the recent burials that violated all Non-Pharmaceuticals Interventions, NPIs, celebrants who may have asymptomatically harboured the virus before and afterward, would travel and return to their different destinations.\n\nTomori said the Presidential Steering Committee, PSC, is basing its decision on the faulty towers of poor uncoordinated testing in the country.\n\n\u201cI say declare Nigeria at the reddest alert, and not some states,\u201d Tomori said.\n\nCorroborating his views, former National Publicity Secretary of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria, AMLSN, Dr Casmier Ifeanyi said although the declaration was a step in the right direction, it was half smart as there is no hard or fast dividing line between the states listed as flashpoints and the other parts of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201dVirus does not travel, and the virus does not move but people move. We have a highly huge mobile youth population and a couple of days ago, people from most of the cities mentioned trooped into Anambra state, far into Oba village, you will see the need for a red alert in one country. I consider that red alert as being half smart and proactive.\u201d\n\nInsisting that all the states in the country are at risk, Ifeanyi said there is no limit or division between states like Lagos and other states.\n\n\u201cYou can see people from the red alert zone entering into other zones. I expect the Presidential Steering Committee, PSC, that rather than limiting red alerts to some states as flashpoints because of the increasing number of cases, they should have rather made it national and reactivated the entire response programme and structure across the country.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the President of the Academy of Medicine Specialties of Nigeria, Prof Oladapo Ashiru, charged the Federal government to step up its response to the pandemic.\n\nAshiru who urged for strict compliance with the safety protocol said it is very worrisome the way the Delta variant has been spreading.\n\n\u201cNow the variant has been reported in Lagos and Oyo states. The public must be very concerned and take personal protection using face masks and social distancing.\n\n\u201cThe expected third wave of COVID-19 is here in Nigeria and we must as a people and with the leadership from our government apply brake and pull back from the various relaxations.\u201d\n\nTaking into consideration the current finding that the very infective Delta variant of the virus has overwhelmed health systems in countries, he said the Delta variant has been reported to be responsible for the current emerging 3rd wave of the pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nHe called on the government to establish strong grassroots-based surveillance and monitoring systems for rapid detection of the virus\n\n\u201cFunding should be provided for rapid and continuous sequencing of Covid-19 so as to track all emergent variants,\u201d he argued.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Harris Emanuel\n\nRESIDENTS of Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, and environs have called on the state government and relevant agencies to monitor closely the activities of gas vendors, especially in residential areas.\n\nThey raised their concerns following the proliferation of cooking gas dispense shops across the streets of Uyo metropolis and surrounding towns, given the inflammatory nature of gas.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with NDV, an inhabitant, Unyime Akpan said: \u201cWe are gradually moving away from fossil fuel but my worry is the proliferation of these gas vendors in residential areas. We all know the combustible nature of gas. We have heard of gas explosion and attendant loss of lives and property in other places. The one that happened a few years ago in Eket is still fresh in our minds and that is why the government must exercise strict control over their activities to safeguard lives and property.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Bassey Etuk said almost all the streets where people reside have at least two gas vendors operating in the area, urging the state government to ensure that the vendors were given frequent safety trainings and ensure that they stick to regulations considering the risk their operations pose.\n\nIgnorance, wrong feasibility study\n\nHowever, Deputy Director of Fire Service, Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Anthony Tom, in an interview, said the proliferation was as a result of ignorance and lack of proper feasibility studies when venturing into the business.\n\n\u201cSome people might think such shops are supposed to be in isolated areas but that is not ideal, note that the volume of danger in that particular situation is also very high in case of any eventuality. You can have a whole city in flames and no one would be spared.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe best option is to stick to the rules, when you want to open a gas dispense shop, follow the rules. Number one, call in the fire service to inspect the space before you even pay for it. They will know the volume of danger in a given environment.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have discovered in the course of our regular inspections that there could be food outlet where open flame is used and besides is a gas dispense shop. The danger here is applicable to everyone, the owner of the shop is not spared, the customers, even the ones patronizing the food outlet are not excluded,\u201d he intoned.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuch shops must be properly assessed to ensure they are suitable, there are safety facilities to be put in place. People coming around such business premises too should also be guided. There are certain things that must be put in place in such environment.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there must be firefighting equipment such as fire extinguishers, there should be no smoking sign, and no naked flame is expected around the vicinity.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are doing our best as civilians to caution those who violate the rules in this regard, we give them a time frame to relocate, if they ignore the time of grace, we take legal action against them by taking the case to court and eventually closing the shop,\u201d he said.\n\nDPR to clampdown on illegal outlets\n\nDepartment of Petroleum Resources, DPR, in Akwa Ibom has also condemned the proliferation of gas shops in residential areas in the state, pledging to clamp down on them.\n\n\n\nOperations Controller, DPR, Mr. Victor Ohwodiasa, told NDV: \u201cIt is unacceptable practice, we will definitely clamp down on them. As I speak now, our men are on the way to check on the illegal gas stations and anyone caught will face the wrath of the law.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is uncompromised operation because safety is involved and we are very critical about it and we do not need to be reactive but proactive. Before we have any incident we need to nip it in the bud,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The use of force to contain agitations has not worked in any viable democracy rather through dialogue, negotiations and ethnic harmony where the government of the day runs an inclusive government of universal interests.\n\n\u201cAs we open our hearts as preached by the Masters of our diverse faiths, imbibing the spirit of Love and co-existing with one another, the human society will be a paradise of excellence unlike the carnages, perils and destructions experienced today due to failure of love and unity spirit in us\u201d.\n\nEid-el Kabir: Police assure adequate security in Osun\n\nThe PDPCO further explained that Nigeria is a country of diverse ethnic interests, but with manifold love for one another, rapid growth and unity of purpose will be tremendously achieved.\n\nIn the same vein, the Chancellor of Gregory University Uturu, in Abia State, Professor Gregory Ibe has enjoined Muslims to sustain the good virtues that made Prophet Mohammed great.\n\nSpeaking on the heels of this year\u2019s celebration, he charged Muslim faithfuls to use this opportunity to \u201coffer prayers for peace, unity, prosperity and an end to the insecurities that have tended to destroy our beloved country Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe further encouraged the faithful to put to good use the lessons learned during the Ramadan period, in order to foster love and unity within the society, by sharing with the less privileged persons as exemplified by holy Prophet Mohammed.\n\nProfessor Ibe maintained that if Muslim faithful both in Nigeria and around the world uphold and practice and teachings of the Holy Quran, peace and tranquility will reign, while insecurity and corruption that have bedeviled the nation will be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cThis, therefore, is an opportunity for our Muslim brothers and sisters to deepen their relationship with Allah, depicted by life of sacrifice, charity and love for one another. I, therefore, urge all Muslims resident in Abia particularly, and their brethren across Nigeria, to continue to sustain these values and thereby use them as building blocks for the attainment of a peaceful Nigerian nation where everyone will be happy to actualise their dreams\u201d, he concluded.\n\nEid-el Kabir: El-Rufai congratulates Muslims, urges them to uphold peace, harmony",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nOgelle, Africa\u2019s first user-generated video content platform, is set to revolutionise education in Africa with Ogelle e-Learning.\n\nOgelle e-Learning, which will be launched in the last quarter of 2021, comes against the backdrop of the urgent need to expand access to primary education and open the door to quality, relevant secondary education for Africans.\n\nTagged \u2018Education Without Walls for All Africa\u2019, it aims to make lifelong learning for Africans a reality as well as make it available and successive, given that people learn at different paces, in order to give an opportunity to those who are potentially left behind.\n\nSpeaking on the rationale behind Ogelle e-Learning, Osita Oparaugo, founder of Ogelle, said whereas there is a compulsory basic education cycle for the 5-15 years age groups in middle and higher-income countries, many of Africa\u2019s youth are denied quality and accessible post-primary education owing to factors such as cost.\n\nMoreover, the current education system in Africa uses outdated methods and is not preparing children for the future, he said.\n\n\u201cThe future success of the African continent lies to a large degree in its ability to hone the skills and talents of its ever-growing youth population and now is the time to rethink secondary education systems, to ensure youth have the skills and knowledge they need,\u201d Oparaugo said.\n\n\u201cFor Africa beyond aid, there must be a shift towards science and technology, though the greatest challenges will then be the issues of cost, quality and access, teachers\u2019 welfare and, in some countries, security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ogelle founder said creating a knowledge-based economy through STEM education is a lifeline for Africa, ensuring the growth of a STEM-capable citizenry.\n\n\u201cWith these issues in mind, especially that of cost, a burden which most families must weigh against other priorities, quality and accessible post primary education still remains an illusion to many of Africa\u2019s youth, hence we developed Ogelle e-Learning: Education Without Walls for All Africa with special focus on English and STEAM as a solution to fill the gap,\u201d Oparaugo said.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that many young Africans are completing primary schooling, and many more will do so in the coming years, means that the number of youngsters who knock at the door of secondary education is vastly increasing, thus creating strong structural pressures on all segments of post-primary schooling.\n\nFor instance, an estimated 10 million graduates enter the African workforce each year and by 2040, the continent\u2019s labour force is expected to surpass that of India and China.\n\n\u201cAs a result, quality education is a central element in building an \u2018Africa beyond aid\u2019 and lies at the backbone of its development and enduring prosperity. Quality education also has a multiplier effect on achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGiving further insight, Oparaugo said Ogelle e-Learning: Education Without Walls for All Africa will offer highly prepared and effective learning programmes for Junior Secondary School 1 to 3 and Senior Secondary School 1 to 3, as well as revision programmes for prospective candidates of competitive examinations like JSS3 and SSS3 certificate exams, the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Exam (UTME), among others. It would also offer a monthly live interactive session where students will have the opportunity to ask questions and get answers.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that a percentage of African youth seeks foreign education, and we have made provision for such aspirants by also partnering with a professor of English based in New York, to teach spoken English and present a full syllabus for those taking SAT or the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL),\u201d Oparaugo said.\n\n\u201cWe focused on the post-primary education school system because for most young Africans, secondary education is the last schooling they will receive before entering the workforce. High quality, relevant secondary education which is accessible to all can prepare youths to enter the workforce, improve productivity, and spur economic transformation, unlocking a virtuous cycle of both human and economic development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the digital age has reshaped the way teenagers learn, especially in Africa, which is why Ogelle brought education and entertainment on the same platform so that African youths can \u201cLEARN + PLAY + DEVELOP\u201d.\n\nLaunched in Lagos, Nigeria in April 2019, Ogelle, a user-generated content and subscription video-on-demand platform offering unlimited entertainment that is 100 percent African, targets 100 million general users and 5 million premium users by 2025.\n\nIt is working to become the highest aggregator of African resource and entertainment platforms in the next few years.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Ezeh, Okwe Obi, Abuja and Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nAs the world commemorates Sallah, Muslims in Nigeria are groaning over the high cost of ram and rising food prices.\n\nRam is a major symbol in the celebration and the practice of slaughtering it is as old as the religion of Islam. However, majority of Muslims have bemoaned the high cost of ram and cows and rising inflation of other foodstuff including rice, beans, yam, pepper, tomatoes and oil.\n\nThis is even as prices of food continued to rise as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures inflation (rate of change in increase in prices) increased by 17.75 per cent in June 2021, signifying a 0.18 drop compared to the 17.93 per cent recorded in May.\n\nAccording to the latest report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the figure implied that prices continued to rise in June but a slightly slower than it did in May.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun across ram and food markets revealed a low turnout as the economic hardship has forced many to stay off the purchase of both rams and cows for the festival.\n\nAt the popular ram market in Kara, on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, an average size ram which sold for about N75,000 in March, now sells for N120,000 while those in bigger sizes range between N150,000 and N300,000. The situation was not different at the Mangoro ram market in Agege as average ram prices sold at N150,000. A buyer who declined to give his name said he had to buy the ram because he had no option.\n\nA distraught Alhaji Akeem Ambali said failure of government to address the increasing rate of insecurity in the North was responsible for the price surge, adding that those in the business of animal husbandry were afraid to rear rams, goats and cows.\n\nBut a ram seller at Kara market, Alhaji Musa Dodo, said another contributory factor was the high cost of transportation. He said the cost of transporting a ram from Kano which hitherto was N4,000 is now N15,000 coupled with the incessant harassment from security agencies who extort drivers on the road.\n\n\u2018\u2018All these cost would be factored into the final price and at the end of the day, the seller will equally add his margin to the final selling price.\u2019\u2019\n\nDaily Sun also went round some markets in Abuja and most buyers complained that prices of ram had soared from an average of N25, 000 to N30,000 to about N40,000 and N100,000 depending on the size. Ram sellers, however, absolved themselves of blame that they were out to make brisk business saying it was not just the price of ram that had gone up, but that of other foodstuff, owing to insecurity and general inflation.\n\nA visit to Kugbo and Kabusa markets in Abuja revealed a rush for ram and cow in spite of the cost. It was observed that while the average cost of cow was between N190,000 and N200,000, the average ram was sold for N40,000, unlike the previous year when the average cost of cow was N150,000 and ram N25,000.\n\nAt a cattle market located at Custom Quarters, Karu, Abuja, a ram seller, Abdullahi Mai Rago, told Daily Sun: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the price is significantly above what we used to sell it in the past but that is not our fault. The economy is not friendly all. Inflation has caught up with everything including cattle.\u201d\n\nSani Audu, cattle seller at Kabusa market said: \u201cWe used to sell an average ram for N30,000 or even less but today, it is N45,000. You can get a cow for N200,000 now before it was N160,000 to N180,000.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun at the popular Oko-Odo food stuff market in Lagos, revealed a sharp increase in prices of rice, onions, tomatoes, beans and vegetable oil.\n\nA rice dealer, Mrs. Mosun Adejumo, said a bag of foreign and local rice sells for N32,000 and N25,000 as against N28,000 and N20,000 respectively\n\nA litre of groundnut oil which hitherto sold for N750 now sells for N950 while a Derica of beans which sold for N400 now sells for N550 and a 5kg of Semo rose to N2,400 from N2,100.\n\nA financial journalist, Adeola Yusuf, in reaction to high cost of ram, said the embargo placed on Hajj rites this year by Saudi Arabia in a bid to curtail the spread of COVID-19 was responsible for surge in ram prices. He noted that about 160,000 Nigerians that ought to perform the Hajj rites has further fuelled the surge in prices of rams.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "OPEC+ Resolves Impasse, to Boost Production by 400,000bpd",
          "text": "*PIB will take care of host oil communities, secure environment, says Buhari\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nAfter over a two-week stalemate, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, yesterday resolved to gradually add more inventory to the oil market, as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) finally put aside their differences.\n\nWith the new agreement, the oil cartel will boost supply by as much as 400,000 barrels per day each month from August until all of its stranded output due to its decision to curb production last year, following the twin impact of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and COVID-19 pandemic, has been restored.\n\nThe breakthrough came just as President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nAccording to the new deal, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Russia have now been given new baselines against which their production cuts are measured from May next year.\n\nThe baselines, which were set using October 2018 production volumes, are used by the OPEC+ alliance to set output quotas, so a higher baseline for a country would result in a more generous allocation.\n\nThe UAE had said that the way its quota was calculated was unfair because it didn\u2019t reflect a costly expansion in the country\u2019s industry. Now seemingly convinced by the country\u2019s presentation, the baseline was increased yesterday to 3.5 million barrels per day, below the 3.8 million it initially demanded but well above the previous level of 3.2 million.\n\nOne of the immediate impacts of the new agreement is that it will ease a looming supply shortage and reduce the risk of an inflationary oil-price spike as well as end the division with the OPEC group.\n\nBack home in Nigeria, it is also expected that the truce will lead to some relief for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), whose Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently raised the alarm over the rising oil price.\n\nKyari hard warned that a rising oil price was bad for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria since buyers of the nation\u2019s crude would either resort to buying less or start the search for alternatives.\n\nKyari put the oil price band with which Nigeria would be comfortable at between $50 to $60 per barrel. The price of the commodity hit $77 recently before falling to between $73 and rising again to $75 during the last week.\n\nWith certainty now restored to the market, consumers now have a clear line of sight as to how quickly OPEC+ will restore the 5.8 million barrels a day of production it is still withholding.\n\nA statement after the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), held via videoconference, stated that the ongoing strengthening of market fundamentals, with oil demand showing clear signs of improvement as economic recovery has continued in most parts of the world with the help of accelerating vaccination programmes.\n\nOPEC welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), especially their overall conformity to the production adjustments which was out 113 per cent in June.\n\nThe statement said OPEC resolved to \u201cAdjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021 until phasing out the 5.8 mb/d production adjustment, and in December 2021 assess market developments and participating countries\u2019 performance.\n\n\u201cContinue to adhere to the mechanism to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings for the entire duration of the Declaration of Cooperation, to assess market conditions and decide on production level adjustments for the following month, endeavouring to end production adjustments by the end of September 2022, subject to market conditions.\u201d\n\nEffective May 1, 2022, OPEC further agreed to adjust the baseline for the calculations of the production adjustments and reiterated the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of September 2021 and fixed the next meeting for September 1, 2021.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s reference oil production up to the end of April 2022 and effective May 2022 stayed at 1.829 million barrels per day, countries that had theirs raised included Iraq, which was increased from 4.653 million bpd to 4.803 million bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s was raised from 2.809 million bpd to 2.0959 million bpd.\n\nAlso, Saudi Arabia\u2019s baseline was raised from 11 million bpd to 11. 5 million bpd, UAE had theirs raised from 3.168 million bpd to 3.5 million bpd and Russia\u2019s was put at 11.5 million bpd from 11 million bpd.\n\nBut it is unclear how quickly additional supplies can be delivered to the market as August sales volumes are largely locked in and most Gulf countries are preparing for an Islamic holiday that will close government offices and businesses for most or all of next week.\n\nBuhari: PIB Will Take Care of Host Oil Communities, Secure Environment\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the just-released OPEC bulletin, which was dedicated to Nigeria, the president stated that when it becomes law, the legislation will reinvigorate the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Nigerian oil and gas industry needs reinvigoration in the presence of the global uncertainty and the threats surrounding the industry. This is the purpose of the PIB. We need more investment to be able to derive optimal benefits from these natural resources.\n\n\u201cWe need a better enabling environment for growth in the industry. We need to take better care of the host communities. We need to be more environmentally conscious. And so the PIB is focused on all these, and more.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the oil cartel for the role it has consistently played in the industry, saying that is important because without OPEC the oil industry would have been in a chaotic situation where the winner takes all.\n\nHe added: \u201cMany countries, like Nigeria, would not have been able to develop their oil industry due to stiff competition. However, the good collaboration between OPEC member countries has made it possible to accommodate both the weak and strong players in the oil production industry. This has been very important, and a catalyst, to the development of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the country must constantly look ahead and plan for the future to ensure that it does not get caught off guard, reason it has to keep investing and strengthening its local capability, both in technology and human resources.\n\nHe stated that being a member of OPEC has facilitated closer relationships and fostered bilateral cooperation in other fields and industries as members seek areas where they can be of help to one another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down. The network provider operates in South Africa\u2019s major metropolitan areas with 3,000 towers.\n\nChildren are evacuated from a burning building in downtown Durban, South Africa. Image credit: AP via NZHerald\n\nOnly Cell C\u2019s facilities had not experienced significant damage from the unrest as of Friday, according to its chief operations officer Andre Ittman.\n\nJust one of its network towers was vandalised within the Durban area but it did not affect service delivery to consumers.\n\nAccording to Ittman, there are six other sites available within a two-kilometre radius of the damaged site, which helped to absorb the coverage provided to ensure customers stayed connected.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe ongoing unrest in South Africa, said to be the worst since the end of the apartheid regime 27 years ago, was sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nLast month, the ex-leader was sentenced to 15 months jail time for defying an order to provide evidence at a judicial inquiry set up to probe high-level corruption during his nine-year tenure (from 2009 \u2013 2018).\n\nProtests swiftly degenerated into violent marches and looting. Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Obi Cubana: Lessons in entrepreneurship, Africapitalism?",
          "text": "Obi Cubana has created a national sensation but what lessons can we learn from this about entrepreneurship and how Africans live capitalism?\n\nOn Sunday 18th July 2021 at the outing and thanksgiving service for late Uche Iyiegbu (Odoziaku), his son, Obi Iyiegbu popularly called Obi Cubana, the entertainment mogul and billionaire pledged to support 300 youths from 300 families in his Oba native community Anambra state with the sum of N1m each to start their own businesses.\n\nThis gesture which may sound outlandish is typical of this young man whose philanthropy has become his second name.\n\nIn his desire to uplift the downtrodden, he has allegedly empowered over 500 youths in the last 15 years from various parts of the county. Hence, it won\u2019t be surprising that in the next 10 to 15 years, some of the beneficiaries of the recent N300m largesse would have become multi-millionaires in their own right.\n\nRead Also: Obinna Iyiegbu, Cubana Group chairman speaks on plans for 2020\n\nThe fact is: You cannot remove Obi\u2019s drive for entrepreneurship and human capacity development from his success story in life.\n\nIndeed, stories have it that the lavish party and Naira rain at his mother\u2019s burial on Friday 16th July 2021 were funded by those he assisted in business.\n\nHere is the import of the Obi brand \u2013 remember and empower those under you, because there would always be a payback time. Like Obi Cubana, successful men and women should make it a duty to introduce and nurture other young men and women adequately.\n\nMoney is good, but we should also encourage people to grow and progress. Imagine that Obi Cubana took in Paschal Okechukwu better known as Cubana chief priest as a boy grew him in business and today, the boy owns a thriving business in Owerri as well as manages Obi Cubana\u2019s business empire.\n\nWhere would the chief priest have been today without his benefactor?\n\nObi\u2019s idea of entrepreneurship and human capacity development is worthy of study.\n\nWhereas the process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship, an entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards.\n\nThe entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business or procedures.\n\nEntrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and bringing good new ideas to market. Although highly risky, entrepreneurship can also be highly rewarding, as it serves to generate economic wealth, growth, and innovation.\n\nHuman capacity development on the other hand has been defined as \u201cThe process by which individuals, groups, organisations, institutions, and societies develop their abilities \u2013 both individually and collectively \u2013 to set and achieve objectives, perform functions, solve problems, and to develop the means and conditions required to enable this process\u201d.\n\nIn the case of Obi Cubana, a number of key lessons are drawn from Obi\u2019s business activities. Most important are these: capacity development initiatives must be participatory in design; implementation and monitoring initiatives must build on core capacities and be a two-way process of knowledge transfer\n\n\u2022 Initiatives must provide for flexible and suitable learning pathways;\n\n\u2022 Approaches must take greater cognizance of the overall societal/political context in which initiatives operate;\n\n\u2022 There is a need for much better integration of initiatives based on regional/geographical, intra-sectorial, inter-sectorial, and vertical linkages;\n\n\u2022 Appropriate incentives must be built into capacity development initiatives, and those delivering capacity developments may themselves require capacity development for effective delivery.\n\nTherefore, an overarching lesson from this young entrepreneur is that capacity needs to be consolidated and strengthened at four levels: in individuals, in organizations/institutions, in sectors and networks, and in the overall enabling environment in which the first three function in this sense, initiatives must take a holistic view of the context in which individuals operate.\n\nBorn on April 12, 1975, in Oba, Anambra State, Obi Iyiegbu (Obi Cubana) attended Secondary school Onitsha and the University of Nigeria Nsukka with a degree in Political Science in 1988.\n\nDescribed as one of the richest Nigerian billionaires, Obi is an entertainer, show promoter, and entrepreneur with a net worth estimated at $96 million (N39.50 billion) This is based on his income, properties, and assets.\n\nFor the mother\u2019s burial, he was said to have received 346 Cows, 72 Goats, and 20 from his friends, employees, and those he supported through life. For instance, he got 46 cows from his former employee Pascal Okechukwu, the Cubana Chief priest, and 10 cows from his old-time friend and young billionaire Jowi Zaza.\n\nIn addition, he also received from his friends, a gold-plated casket for his late mother estimated at $73,000. The socialite also had a diamond pendant made for his late mother which he said had to replicate his mother\u2019s face. His friends and business partners had saved up over $648,646 for the funeral\n\nA video of the funeral went viral where guests were seen throwing cash at each other. Multiple award-winning artists, Davido, Phyno, D\u2019banj, Kanayo O. Kanayo, E-money, Shina Peller, Ubi Franklin, Cubana Chief Priest, Kcee, and Odumeje were among the celebrities that attended the burial ceremony.\n\nIn 2006, Obi Cubana started his first business, Ibiza Club in Abuja, seeking to satisfy fun seekers and nightlife lovers.\n\nFollowing the remarkable progress he made from the Ibiza Club, he established the Cubana group, a hospitality club that provides all-around entertainment satisfaction in 2009. Cubana group was first established in Owerri, Imo state.\n\nToday, Cubana has spread across various states in the country including Lagos, Abuja, and Enugu.\n\nCubana group businesses and establishments include; Rolex Hotels \u2013 Lagos, Pablo Cubana \u2013 Lagos, Crave Cubana \u2013 Abuja, Grand Cubana Hotels \u2013 Abuja, Opium Cubana \u2013 Owerri, Cubana Night Clubs \u2013 Lagos, and Gustavo Cubana- Enugu\n\nThe businessman is currently working on opening more clubs worldwide with the planned opening of one in Dubai and a Cubana real estate company. He owns several mansions across the country along with expensive cars.\n\nIn recognition of his achievements, he has received several awards and recognition across the country. His wife, Ebele Iyiegbu, a lawyer, is the founder and owner of the KIEK foundation, a non-governmental organization.",

          "title": "Delta Covid riskier: Evades immunity, vaccines",
          "text": "An infected person will need eight times higher concentrations of antibodies to fight off the new version of the coronavirus.\n\nLike a new sheriff in town, the latest coronavirus variant, Delta, is sweeping through the world with a fierce attack on immunity acquired through either infection or vaccination.\n\nIt is quietly slipping through vaccinated people who may not show signs of infection but can still infect others, leading to a dangerous impact on unvaccinated people. In its trail are rising hospitalisation levels and death.\n\nA clear statement from the behavioural pattern of this new strain, as affirmed by even the World Health Organisation, is that: it poses a greater risk with 30 to 60 percent more transmissibility than other variants of concern.\n\nRead Also: Recovered COVID patients likely protected for at least six months, study finds\n\nOn average, an infected person will need eight times higher concentrations of antibodies to fight off the new version of the virus compared to the old ones, Morgan Chetty, a professor of health sciences, stated in a piece of expert insight.\n\nThe third wave in South Africa, along with neighbouring Namibia, seems to be the worst yet, attributable to the Delta variant as they see up to 30,000 average new cases. In Uganda, the variant was detected in 97 percent of samples while 136 students tested positive for this COVID-19 variant in Ghana.\n\nIt is already rendering some of the most efficacious vaccine brands less effective with individuals showing waning immunity even after vaccination.\n\nThe B.1.617 (Delta) lineage was identified in October 2020 in India and has since then become dominant in some Indian regions and the UK, and further spread to more than 100 countries.\n\nResearch published by Nature, a science journal, shows that the lineage includes three main subtypes: B1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3, harbouring diverse spike mutations, which may increase their ability to evade immunity.\n\nThe study isolated an infectious Delta strain from a traveller returning from India and examined its sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in serums from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral strains. The researchers found that Delta was resistant to neutralisation by some domains, which should normally cripple its effect.\n\nSerums from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms were fourfold less potent against the Delta variant, relative to the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7).\n\nSerum from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines barely inhibited the Delta Variant. Administration of two doses generated a neutralising response in 95 percent of individuals, with antibodies three to fivefold lower against Delta than Alpha.\n\nAs a result, the study concluded that Delta spread is associated with an escape to antibodies.\n\nChetty, a professor at the University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, agrees also that escape-mutations may drive new resurgence, citing how the B1.1351 variant first identified in South Africa developed changes in the genetic code that makes it more menacing than the original virus. The version contains changes to the re-grow of the spike protein that human antibodies target to fight the virus.\n\n\u201cThe newly reported variants carry the E484K mutation. The mutation was also found in the B.1.1.7 variant that originally was detected in the UK and the B.1.351 and B.1.128 variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil repeatedly,\u201d Chetty explained.\n\n\u201cThe E484K mutation, which scoops a negatively changed antibody and effectively destroys the binding site. This is likely to make it difficult for antibodies elicited by the old variant to bind the new variant. E484K is called an escape because it helps the mutation escape the immune protection and the virus can slip past the immune defence.\u201d\n\nAnother source, he says could drive escape mutation, is the incomplete protection by the vaccine. More variants are found all over the world. Many of them do not significantly change how the virus behaves but some are more potentially dangerous. They make the virus more contagious and could make it more lethal or better at escaping existing vaccines.\n\nThe newest variant of major concern found in India has had a catastrophic impact on infections, mortality and has overwhelmed India\u2019s health system. \u201cThe spread of these variants could mean that the COVID-19 pandemic could be here to stay and maybe the reason why vaccine escape is a major concern,\u201d Chetty says.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unvaccinated at risk\n\nMore than 99 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population remains unvaccinated and the country is now among 16 countries that have reported the appearance of the Delta.\n\n\u201cThe variant was detected in a traveller to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja,\u201d the National Centre for Disease Control recently said.\n\nThe NCDC has urged all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. It advised that public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and proper use of facemasks should be followed to prevent infections and save lives.\n\nGiven the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, the NCDC said positive samples from international travellers to Nigeria are frequently sequenced as part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\nThe Nigerian government some months ago placed travel restrictions on countries experiencing a surge in cases associated with variants of concern: India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey.\n\nNCDC has now urged states to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State, Nigeria\u2019s epicentre of the disease, also noted that the state had begun to see a steep rise in daily cases, with the positivity rate jumping from 1.1 percent at the end of June to 6.6 percent as of July 8.\n\nThe general mood is being adjusted more in corporate settings than other places, and if the pattern of old strains emerging in Nigeria is anything to go by, the country might as well scale through without huge losses. However, only time will tell if \u2018luck\u2019 will be enough this time around.",

          "text": "An aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Ita Enang, has exchanged words with the Akwa Ibom State Government over the location for a newly approved federal university of technology for the state.\n\nMr Enang, Mr Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Niger Delta Affairs, is feeling disappointed that the university would not be sited in his hometown, Ididep, in Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nHe said Governor Udom Emmanuel wanted to take the university to his (the governor\u2019s) hometown.\n\nThe location approved by the federal government for the university is in Ikot Abasi Local Government Area.\n\nMr Emmanuel is from Onna, which is a different local government area, but within the same Senatorial District with Ikot Abasi.\n\nMr Enang, a former senator who had represented Uyo Senatorial District, told PREMIUM TIMES he facilitated the establishment of the university, and that he had wanted it sited in his hometown.\n\n\u201cEvery processing and everything was done for the university to be sited in Ididep in the present Senior Science College, formerly teachers training college, which has all the facilities to host a university,\u201d Mr Enang said on Monday.\n\n\u201cI initiated everything about the university,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Enang told reporters in Uyo that Mr Emmanuel wrote a letter to the federal government, asking that the university be sited in Onna where the governor hails from.\n\n\u201cI have considered his action as improper, imprudent and not acting as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cThe governor is acting in a manner that could be described as Udomcentric, Onnacentric. He was chosen to be the governor of the entire Akwa Ibom people and not the chairman of Onna local government or councillor representing his ward.\n\n\u201cOnna has a university teaching hospital, Onna has the flour mill, Onna has the plywood mill, Onna has a syringe factory, every good road is made in Onna, Onna has the biggest private estate owned by one person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Enang is seeking attention\u2019\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Government has, however, dismissed Mr Enang\u2019s claim that he facilitated the establishment of the university.\n\nThe Commissioner for Education in the state, Idongesit Etiebiet said the presidential aide was merely seeking attention.\n\n\u201cThis transaction had and still has no input or contribution of the attention-seeking senator,\u201d Mrs Etiebiet said in a statement on Monday.\n\nShe said the state government wrote to the federal government, requesting that the university should be sited in Eket Senatorial District, since the two other districts \u2013 Uyo and Ikot Ekpene \u2013 already have a federal higher institution each.\n\n\u201cI cannot comment on what I do not know about,\u201d the commissioner responded when PREMIUM TIMES asked if it was true that the governor wanted the university to be in his hometown.\n\nEleven higher institutions in Akwa Ibom\n\nIt is a common practice in Nigeria for the government, at the federal and state levels, to distribute major institutions and projects among geopolitical areas so as to create a sense of belonging.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut sometimes, or even most times, due to excessive political influence, such practice is sacrificed, and replaced with the concentration of projects in a particular geopolitical area(s).\n\nThe Uyo District, which Mr Enang had represented in the Senate, already has a federal university, the University of Uyo, while Ikot Ekpene District has a federal polytechnic in Ukana, the hometown of Godswill Akpabio, the minister of Niger Delta Affairs and a former governor of Akwa Ibom.\n\nBoth Uyo and Ikot Ekpene districts, in addition, have two state-owned higher institutions, the College of Education, Afaha Nsit, and the Akwa Ibom State Polytechnic, Ikot Osura, respectively.\n\nThe Eket District has Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, which could be counted as a federal institution, especially when the Senate has just passed a bill for the academy to be upgraded to a university for maritime studies.\n\nIkot Abasi, where the new federal university of technology is to be sited, is about 30 minute drive to Mkpat Enin Local Government Area where there already exists a university, Akwa Ibom State University, though owned by the state government.\n\nIkot Abasi, a coastal town, is also home to the moribund Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria and the Akwa Ibom State government-owned Ibom Power Plant.\n\nThere is a plan by the Nigerian government, in partnership with the Moroccan government, to establish a $1.4 billion dollar fertilizer plant in Ikot Abasi.\n\nMr Enang, despite the feeling of disappointment, appeared to have accepted Ikot Abasi as the location for the new university.\n\n\u201cThe federal government said there must be a spread and that one senatorial district cannot have two universities from the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cI am not selfish. The fact that it is not sited where I had in mind originally does not mean it should not be in Akwa Ibom State,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the Commissioner for Information in the state, Ini Ememobong said the presidential aide was \u201csuffering from a mirror syndrome\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the same person that attracts everything for Ididep, not Ibiono, not Uyo.\n\n\u201cWhen he is talking about Calabar-Itu Road, he is talking of the spur to Ididep, because he is from Ididep. He is suffering from mirror syndrome. When he is looking at the mirror he thinks he is seeing Governor Emmanuel but he is seeing himself,\u201d the Punch newspaper quoted Mr Ememobong as saying.\n\nThe new university in Akwa Ibom was one of the four specialised universities approved by President Buhari in June. The other three are to be located in Jigawa, Bauchi and Osun states.\n\nThe minister of education had announced the president\u2019s approval of an N18 billion take-off grant for the new universities.\n\nBy the time the new university takes off, Akwa Ibom, which would be 34 years old as a state, in September, would have 11 higher institutions, including two private universities and three private polytechnics.",

          "text": "Leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin on Tuesday, fell below $30,000 again as investors worldwide fret about the Delta variant and what it means for the next stage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is down roughly 6% over the last 24 hours, according to Coindesk. Other cryptocurrencies also fell: Ethereum is down about 7%, while dogecoin, the crypto that started as a meme currency, also slid nearly 7%.\n\nBitcoin was last trading at about $29,800 per coin on Tuesday, its lowest level since last month, CNN reported.\n\nThe fall comes after Wall Street was hit hard Monday by anxiety over the recent spread of Covid-19 and the threat it poses to the economic recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) plummeted about 725 points, a drop of 2.1%. The S&P 500 (SPX) ended the day down 1.6% and the Nasdaq (COMP) was 1.1% lower.\n\nAsian markets followed the skid on Tuesday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 (N225) falling nearly 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index (HSI) tumbled 0.8%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi (KOSPI) slumped 0.4%, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) was flat.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the ultimate risky asset right now and it could see intense selling pressure if Wall Street enters into panic selling mode,\u201d wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda, in a Monday research note.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptos have had a tough year, having been gripped by extreme volatility in recent months. In June, bitcoin (XBT) plunged below $30,000 for the first time since late January.\n\nThe latest drop came as investors worried about the impact of the Delta variant on the reopening of the global economy. Shares in airlines, cruise lines and energy stocks all took a dive in the United States on Monday. Long-term bond rates continued to slide as well, a sign that fixed income investors are now far more worried about a Delta variant-induced economic slowdown than they are about rising inflation fears.\n\nEuropean and US stocks were posed for a little bit of a rebound on Tuesday, though. Major indexes in Europe were up in early morning trade, with the FTSE 100 (UKX) in London France\u2019s CAC 40 (CAC40) each gaining about 1%.\n\nUS stock futures also edged higher. Dow futures were last up about 0.7%, while futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were up about 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.\n\nCNN",

Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal Government has flagged off the construction of the Kaduna-Kano segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernization project.\n\nSpeaking at the Ground Breaking Ceremony in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to reviving the Nigerian Railway system.\n\nHe said the project when completed, will not only drive the nation\u2019s economies through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation but will also reduce the deficiency in our nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis administration recognizes rail transportation as a potent economic driver and as such, has accorded railway infrastructure development the greatest priority it deserves and it is not surprising that several landmarks have been achieved, from the Flag-off for commercial operation of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway in 2016 to the recent commissioning of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project on June 10, 2021, thereby maintaining the pace for the actualization of this vital thoroughfare\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project is crucial to the establishment of a supply chain in railway transport within its corridor, Kano \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Abuja, as it links the major commercial cities of Kano and Kaduna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cthis railway connection when completed will establish the ports in Lagos, as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\nThe railway line will be linked to the second Port in Lagos, the Tin Can Island Port. It is also expected that the Inland Dry Port on these routes will be activated and the ports can now receive imports directly from the international market as ports of destination such as the Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano Inland Dry Ports\u201d.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi says the project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, and further create employment and promote trade.\n\nHe said \u201d The project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment and promote trade. In the long term, the railway will help decongest the Lagos Port Complex and increase its efficiency as well as further increase the viability of the Inland Dry Ports located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cThe scope of the railway project involves a 203km double track standard gauge railway from Kano to Kaduna. The railway along this route traverses the major cities of Kaduna, Zaria, and Kano with three (3) railway stations both for passenger and freight services at Rigachukun, Zaria, and Kano with varying capacities and categories\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the Commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano \u2013 Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan \u2013 Abuja, will link the Sea Ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic. This I believe will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease\u201d.\n\n\u201d The rail line is also provided with accessories and special installations including Power and Water Supply schemes, Signalling System & Communication in GSM-R, Freight yards, Rolling stock depots, and maintenance workshops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna \u2013 Kano railway project is to link the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Railway project via Abuja, Minna, Ilorin, Oshogbo, Ibadan to Lagos on one end, and Maradi, Niger Republic on the other.",

          "text": "Muslims in Nigeria have joined their counterparts across the globe to celebrate the 2021 Eid-El-Adha also known as Eid-El Kabir.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, Muslims converged on the Abuja National Eid Ground to observe the three Rak\u2019at.\n\nThe prayers were observed with strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nBefore going into the Eid ground, worshippers lined up to have their temperatures checked as health workers are also on the ground to administer hand sanitizers on the hands of the worshippers.\n\nAmong the personalities who observed prayer at the National, Eid ground is the FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello.\n\nThe prayer was led by the Imam of the National Mosque, Dr Muhammad Kabir Adam.\n\nIn his Sallah message, the Muslim cleric urged Muslims to imbibe the virtues of self-sacrifice, obedience to God, and love for humanity as exemplified by Prophet Ibrahim. He urged them to share part of the meat of whatever they have slaughtered with those in need.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eid-El-Kabir: Demonstrate Good Virtues Of Islam, Buhari Tells Muslims\n\nThe Minister of FCT, Mr Mohammed Bello whiled addressing journalists at the end of the prayers called on residents of the nation\u2019s capital to be law-abiding, security conscious, and united.\n\nAccording to him, FCT is a melting pot for Nigeria where people of various backgrounds reside, making it the centre of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\nMr Bello also said the FCT administration will continue to harp on the need for residents to abide by the COVID-19 protocols, especially in the face of a third wave of the pandemic.\n\nBuhari Prays In Daura\n\nIn Daura, Katsina North, and hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari, hundreds of residents from within and outside the town attended the two Rak\u2019at prayers.\n\nPresident Buhari and other dignitaries observed prayers were at the Kofar Arewa Eid Prayer Ground.\n\nThe prayer which was led by Imam Safiyanu Yusuf Dansanwai commenced at about 10:00 am to 10:05 am.\n\nAlso in attendance were the Emir of Daura, Umar Farouq Umar other traditional and religious leaders including the ward, village and district heads as well as members of the business and political communities in Daura.\n\nEid-El-Adha also referred to as the festival of sacrifice, is celebrated worldwide by Muslims and is marked with the slaughtering of rams, cows, and sheep.\n\nIn Muslim parlance, the festival is the most important feast because it is an occasion to celebrate the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Isma\u2019el, in submission to Allah\u2019s command.\n\nIn commemoration of this intervention, an animal, usually, a ram, is sacrificed ritually and divided into three parts.\n\nOne share is given to the poor and needy, another is kept for home and the third portion is given to relatives.\n\nAs usual, after performing the two Rak\u2019at Eid-El Kabir prayers and the ritual sacrifice, people come out mostly in Northern states to watch the historic Durbar otherwise called Hawan Sallah.\n\nHowever, due to the pandemic, both Katsina and Daura Emirate Councils have announced the cancellation of the 2021 Eid-El Kabir Durbar Festival to contain the spread of the virus and the banditry.\n\nSanusi Leads Prayers In Kaduna\n\nIn Kaduna, former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi led the Eid prayer at the Murtala Mohammed prayer ground in the Kaduna metropolis.\n\nAmong the dignitaries that attended the prayer include Governor Nasir El-Rufai, the Senator representing Kaduna central, Uba Sani among others.\n\nIn his message, the former Emir of Kano called on Nigerians to continue to live in peace irrespective of their religious or ethnic differences so as to foster peace and unity in the country.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai in his address spoke on the importance of peaceful coexistence. He announced that more troops have been deployed to Kaduna State to help flush out bandits and other criminals in a bid to restore peace and security in the state.\n\nHe, however, solicited for prayers from the citizens to help tackle the myriads of challenges confronting the state.",

Okaa directed INEC to publish the former CBN Governor\u2019s name which was removed from the electoral umpire\u2019s list last Friday and replaced with that of Hon Chukwuma Michael Umeoji.\n\nJustice Okaa in passing judgment ordered INEC to remove the name of Hon Umeoji from its list and ordered him to stop parading himself as the candidate of APGA for the November election.\n\nThe court also reaffirmed that Chief Victor Oye is the indisputable national chairman of APGA and directed that Chief Edozie Njoku and Mr. Jude Okeke should stop parading themselves as chairmen.\n\nREAD ALSO: Court Halts Impeachment of Zamfara Deputy Governor\n\nSimilarly, in Senator Uba\u2019s case, a High Court in Awka presided over by Justice Obiora Nwabunike did not only order INEC to list the lawmaker\u2019s name as the rightful candidate but also awarded N10 million damages against the defendants namely, the PDP and Mr. Val Ozigbo, the other candidate of the party produced at the primary supervised by the leadership of the party.\n\nAccording to the judge, the primary that produced Uba was the authentic one because there was a court ruling by Justice Adeniyi of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, which had not been vacated.\n\n\u201cAn order of the court, whether it is right or wrong, must be obeyed until it is vacated.

          "text": "India\u2019s excess deaths during the pandemic could be a staggering 10 times the official Covid-19 toll, likely making it modern India\u2019s worst human tragedy, according to the most comprehensive research yet on the ravages of the virus in the south Asian country.\n\nMost experts believe India\u2019s official toll of more than 414,000 dead is a vast undercount, but the government has dismissed those concerns as exaggerated and misleading.\n\nThe report released Tuesday estimated excess deaths \u2014 the gap between those recorded and those that would have been expected \u2014 to be between 3 million to 4.7 million between January 2020 and June 2021. It said an accurate figure may \u201cprove elusive\u201d but the true death toll \u201cis likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count.\u201d\n\nThe report, published by Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government\u2019s former chief economic adviser, and two other researchers at the Center for Global Development and Harvard University, said the count could have missed deaths occurring in overwhelmed hospitals or while health care was delayed or disrupted, especially during the devastating peak surge earlier this year.\n\n\u201cTrue deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India\u2019s worst human tragedy since Partition and independence,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Partition of the British-ruled Indian subcontinent into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 led to the killing of up to 1 million people as gangs of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered each other.\n\nThe report on India\u2019s virus toll used three calculation methods: data from the civil registration system that records births and deaths across seven states, blood tests showing the prevalence of the virus in India alongside global COVID-19 fatality rates, and an economic survey of nearly 900,000 people done thrice a year.\n\nResearchers cautioned that each method had weaknesses, such as the economic survey omitting the causes of death.\n\nInstead, researchers looked at deaths from all causes and compared that data to mortality in previous years \u2014 a method widely considered an accurate metric.\n\nResearchers also cautioned that virus prevalence and COVID-19 deaths in the seven states they studied may not translate to all of India, since the virus could have spread worse in urban versus rural states and since health care quality varies greatly around India.\n\nAnd while other nations are believed to have undercounted deaths in the pandemic, India is believed to have a greater gap due to it having the world\u2019s second highest population of 1.4 billion and its situation is complicated because not all deaths were recorded even before the pandemic.\n\nDr. Jacob John, who studies viruses at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, reviewed the report for The Associated Press and said it underscores the devastating impact Covid-19 had on the country\u2019s under-prepared health system.\n\n\u201cThis analysis reiterates the observations of other fearless investigative journalists that have highlighted the massive undercounting of deaths,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nThe report also estimated that nearly 2 million Indians died during the first surge in infections last year and said not \u201cgrasping the scale of the tragedy in real time\u201d may have \u201cbred collective complacency that led to the horrors\u201d of the surge earlier this year.\n\nOver the last few months, some Indian states have increased their COVID-19 death toll after finding thousands of previously unreported cases, raising concerns that many more fatalities were not officially recorded.\n\nSeveral Indian journalists have also published higher numbers from some states using government data. Scientists say this new information is helping them better understand how Covid-19 spread in India.\n\nMurad Banaji, who studies mathematics at Middlesex University and has been looking at India\u2019s COVID-19 mortality figures, said the recent data has confirmed some of the suspicions about undercounting. Banaji said the new data also shows the virus wasn\u2019t restricted to urban centers, as contemporary reports had indicated, but that India\u2019s villages were also badly impacted.\n\n\u201cA question we should ask is if some of those deaths were avoidable,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Calls for Outside Help as Extreme Weather Fuels Oregon Fires",
          "text": "The threat of thunderstorms and lightning has prompted officials in fire-ravaged Oregon to ask for help from outside the Pacific Northwest to prepare for additional blazes as many resources are already devoted to a massive fire in the state that has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island.\n\nThe 537-square-mile (1,391-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges. Evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.\n\nBut eyeing how the Bootleg Fire \u2014 fueled by extreme weather \u2014 keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there.\n\n\u201cAlthough the lightning activity predicted for early this week is expected to occur east of us, we are prepared for the worst, and hoping for the best,\u201d Mike McCann, an assistant fire staff, said Monday in a statement released by the national forest.\n\nThe worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska.\n\nMeanwhile, to the east, the Bootleg Fire\u2019s jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.\n\nIf the fire were in densely populated parts of California, \u201cit would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,\u201d said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University\u2019s College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. \u201cBut it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It\u2019s not the Bay Area out there.\u201d\n\nAt least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.\n\nPushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that\u2019s increasingly remote.\n\nEvacuation orders on the fire\u2019s southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it\u2019s small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek \u2014 both with fewer than 250 people \u2014 and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.\n\nBut as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it\u2019s not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire\u2019s size so far puts it fourth on the list of the state\u2019s largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.\n\nThese megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.\n\nThe largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River\u2013Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California.\n\nThe Bootleg Fire is now about 25% contained.\n\nOn Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.\n\nThe Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday.\n\nExtremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.\n\nAnd in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles (93 square kilometers) with no containment.\n\nThunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.",
