          "title": "2023: Jonathan\u2019s rumoured flirtation with APC",
          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nFor more than a year now, speculations of former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s possible defection to the All Progressives Congress, APC, have not waned, as pundits and newsmen alike continue to link the zoologist-turn politician with yet another crack at the Presidential Villa.\n\nJonathan became governor of Bayelsa state in 2005 following the fall of his former mentor, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha who was impeached for corruption-related offences. In 2007, he became Vice President on a joint ticket with late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua who again yielded the exalted seat to Jonathan following his death in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Jonathan contested and won election into the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria but his re-election bid in 2015 suffered a setback as he lost to Muhammadu Buhari who flew the flag of the then hurriedly-assembled APC. In the few months after his victory and subsequent inauguration as President, Buhari often chided Jonathan and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for what he believed was their poor management of the nation\u2019s fortunes, particularly crude oil earnings over a period of 16 years.\n\nHowever, President Buhari has been full of praises for his predecessor in recent times, often crediting him for saving the nation\u2019s democracy following his decision to concede defeat in 2015. In the past few months, Jonathan has been a regular guest at Aso Rock, meeting his successor in close-door sessions. More often than not, State House Correspondents who waited for briefing at the end of such meetings were disappointed as smiling Jonathan would simply wave at them and disappear into thin air at the end of such meetings.\n\nThis coupled with Jonathan\u2019s absence from every event organised by his party in the past few years has led to intense speculations of the possibility of him running for the plum office on the platform of APC in 2023.\n\nBut media adviser to former President Jonathan, Ikechukwu Eze has said his principal\u2019s visit to President Buhari earlier in the week has nothing to do with politics, saying \u201cI can confirm to you that the visit of His Excellency to the Presidential Villa was purely to provide an update on the political situation in Mali.\n\n\u201cAs the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS mediator in Mali, Jonathan, went to the Villa to update the President on his mediation role ahead of the ECOWAS summit slated for Sunday, in Ghana.\n\n\u201cJonathan just came back from Mali and he went to brief the President ahead of the summit of the Authority of Heads of State, which he also is attending,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the ECOWAS summit is held on Sunday, in Ghana and a key item for discussion is the development in Mali.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there has been a delay in releasing the timetable for the conduct of Mali\u2019s election. The country had a national conference which was just concluded and they made recommendations on the time elections could hold.\n\n\u201cSo, ECOWAS will be meeting on Sunday and that is why Jonathan visited Buhari,\u201d Eze explained.\n\nIt would be recalled that Jonathan had on Dec. 31, 2021, visited President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, and quickly proceeded on a closed-door meeting with the President.\n\nThe PDP has continuously insisted that Jonathan would not jump ship to the APC, insisting that the man remain committed to the ideals of the party that shot him into the national and global limelight.",

Or did Aregbesola also meet with Omisore before saying that?\n\n\u201cWere the reports from Mr Governor\u2019s Thank You Tour and UK DFID Needs Assessment exercise were also influenced by Omisore?\n\n\u201cRather than try to vilify the Governor, Osun Defender and Aregbesola should cover their faces in shame if they cannot commend Oyetola for helping to salvage the image of the party in the State by being more responsible in the governance of the State even to the admiration of the opposition in the state.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that Oyetola was not in the know of how APC reached out to Omisore in the build-up to the re-run election.

The NPA should be concerned about its port rating globally, especially in relation to port friendliness, costs and efficiency\u2019\u2019, he added.\n\nHe also said that the Blue Economy project should be communicated further to the stakeholders, especially, in the area of research and human capacity development, as enshrined in the AIM-Strategy content development.\n\nThe statement also noted \u201cthe noticeable delays that trailed the change of guard in the leadership of the Nigeria Shippers Council, NSC. Good enough the new helmsman has recently announced his new agenda of actions for the industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018The CREFFPON wish to state clearly that, the essence of an economic regulator in the industry is gradually losing steam, and we hope that the new agenda will revamp the industry by instituting an industry pricing system that promotes competiveness and meets the international best practices.\n\n\u201cThe Shipping Companies, Terminal Operators, Customs and others are all declaring excess revenue cum profits, amidst low cargo throughputs. While congratulating them, it equally speaks volumes that something is wrong somewhere in their mode of operations.\n\n\u201cThe new services in the industry, the barges operations \u2013 while commending them for the interventionist services undertaken to remedy the port congestion, again we have to caution on the need for a streamlined tariff system and efficiency concerns.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the Governing Council election of the Council for Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria, CRFFN, he stated: \u2018\u2018The CREFFPON is of the view that, in the year 2022, the ministry will take a firm stand aimed to conclude the electioneering process. The freight forwarders cannot continually afford to stay divided by mere trivial issues. Time to think more of our profession other than our individual interests is now.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also said, \u201cThe Haulage sector of the freight forwarding profession requires an intervention. The present trucking system needs better reorganization, and the CREFFPON shall be at the forefront to drive this objective in the year. The importance of a transport logistics services can not be overstated, as it touches the lives of Nigerians significantly.\n\n\u201cAbove all, the cost of doing business in the Nigeria ports is still very expensive and does not add up towards a healthy economy. Today, ports within the region have positioned themselves to transhipment hub and ready for prompt participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area regime. Already, reports of the diversion of the Nigerian bound imports to Lome, Cotonu, Cameroun, Ghana, etc. Their recent cargo throughputs increases are a confirmation to this development.\u2019\u2019",

This explains the reason francophone countries are reticent on issues of cooperation, especially when France\u2019s interest is likely to be in jeopardy,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking on piracy in the GoG, former National President of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, NAGAFF, Eugene Nweke, and former Director of Shipping Development at the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, Enisouh Warredi, hinted of a failure of the Nigerian Navy and the recently lunched Deep Blue project inability to tackle piracy in the area.\n\nThey explained that these navies invading the GoG claim to be in the area as a result of bilateral agreement with the Nigerian Navy but further findings show that they are also providing protection for their assets in the area.\n\nThey warned that the presence of these navies poses a threat to the countries in the sub-region. They, therefore called on Nigerian government and those of the region to act decisively before it is too late.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders to put their house in order so that the ruling party can retain power in next year\u2019s election.\n\nHe warned against the persistent differences, disunity and lack of agreement, which could put the platform in jeopardy during election.\n\nPresident Buhari, who spoke on the challenges confronting the APC during an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), foreclosed the possibility of foisting party leadership on members by any kingmaker.\n\nHe acknowledged the disagreement among APC leaders, which is delaying the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nThe President also explained that he withheld assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 because he wanted a botton-up structure that will give the power to choose party leaders to members.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said the approach would give party members the opportunity to choose their preferred candidates from polling unit to ward, council area, state and national level.\n\nThe President urged the ruling party to learn from the mistake of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which made power to shift to the ruling party in 2015.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cWe have a timeframe we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the APC can\u2019t agree, then, the opposition will naturally take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off. They are still off. They can see it.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple. I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then, to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituencies, they will know their leaders, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja. No constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after Abuja. So, those who want to be elected at any level, let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody\u201d.\n\nOn the notion that suspected corrupt politicians from the opposition have been defecting to the ruling party to escape justice, the President said no corruption politician would go scot-free under his watch, even as members of his party.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity, both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people really to even be corrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something in my record. A lot of confusion could have been caused, but luckily, I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigerian leadership at all levels.\n\n\u201cBehave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarreling and making a lot of noise\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed optimism that the security situation can be resolved before he leaves office, pointing out that security forces are working hard as more equipment and ammunition are being procured.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe government is capable and is going to do it because members of the security, the Armed Forces and others, their own security depends on one Nigeria. So, no matter, when people are selfish, it is their self first. So, even for themselves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the Northeast and Southsouth and how much progress we have made and acquiring some helicopters, aircraft, their maintenance, their ammunition, armoured cars, you know to counter effectively, the bandits. They cost money and they cost time for training and adaptation\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on how age had affected his capacity as President, the President, who said the pressure of office had been tremendous, noted however, that he could not complain because he asked to be elected into the office.\n\nHe observed that many of his colleagues are now enjoying their retirement, adding that he hopes to emulate them in the next 17 months when his tenure ends.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see you, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time. About my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for six, seven, eight hours a day in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week. So, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain\u201d.\n\nOn sucession, President Buhari said: \u201cYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as President. So, I have gone through the system and really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201dI have given my best and I hope after I leave, Nigerians will reflect. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But, what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But, it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the Southeast now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing. We closed the border with Benin, we closed the border with Niger. But, we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armories, police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, i will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now\u201d.",

          "title": "PMB and the futurologists, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "It\u2019s the beginning of a year, and it\u2019s that time you hear all sorts from futurists, prospectivists, and foresight practitioners.\n\nThe Good Book tells us of the 5-fold Ministries of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers. These are offices into which God has called some people, to lead, guide and comfort His people. Unfortunately,however, some people have decided to call themselves, and they go about, running riot all over the place with guess work, divination, and outright falsehood, all to beguile the people, pass themselves off as somebody, and ultimately make filthy money.\n\nSince he became leader of the country, President Muhammadu Buhari has been an object of the futurologists. They have come up with tons of predictions, many of which went wide off the mark, hitting the crossbar.\n\nMany times, they have virtually killed him. Many other times, they have deposed him through the 2019 election. They have foreseen sickness, death, empty seat at the Presidential Villa. But year after year, month after month, President Buhari continues to do his duty to the country, and to his family. He remains constant like the Northern Star.\n\nYes, typical of a human being, he can be sick and indisposed from time to time. We remember 2017, when President Buhari was practically unavailable between January and August, with only intermittent returns to the country in-between. Human beings, prince or pauper, President or manual laborer, can be ill, can recover, or can even die. What eventually happens is a matter of mercy from God Almighty.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\u201d (Romans 9: 15). President Buhari has obtained mercy, compassion, in plenitude, and many a false prophet is frustrated. Even angry. All their prognostications have failed, and the next thing is to write a book on them, like Prof. Wole Soyinka did. \u2018Requiem for a Futurologist.\u2019 Many so-called prophets are tricksters, artificers, swindlers, charlatans, scoundrels.\n\nI had cause to take up a mountebank sometime last year, when he said the President\u2019s jet would crash at the last quarter of 2021. What was his intention? Patronage. That the President should send emissaries to him with bags of money, so he could pray and stave off the tragedy. Prayer contractor! The President was particularly busy with international travels at the period the \u2018prophet\u2019 mentioned. USA, Ethiopia, Riyadh, Glasgow, London, Paris, Durban, Dubai, Turkey, and many other places. Did any accident happen? Not even an incident. That is where God is different from man. He has mercy on whom He will have mercy.\n\nThat was what the marabouts did to Sani Abacha, that he remained holed in Aso Rock. Between November 1993 and June 1998 that he was head of state, you could count both local and foreign trips he made on the fingers of one hand. There was a time plenty hype had been made on his visit to Oyo State, to commission the Asejire Water Scheme. The State was agog with expectations, and a holiday had been declared. Only for Abacha not to show up. He had been caged by the futurologists.\n\nAt another time, he had been confirmed to visit Lagos, to commission projects, including the Marwa Gardens, in Alausa area of Ikeja. Col Buba Marwa was a star, a poster boy of the administration. Visiting Lagos would have been good for Abacha himself. And all was set. The city had been put under lockdown. At the last minute, Abacha refused to show up. Caged again by the horizon scanners, who always see negative, never anything positive.\n\nIt was said that in the few times the head of state ventured out of the fortress called Aso Rock, he would lock up all the Service Chiefs at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, until he returned. So that they wouldn\u2019t be able to effect a military coup while he was away. Whether the story is true, or apocryphal, I don\u2019t know. What I sure know is that the day Abacha\u2019s time was up, it was simply up. \u201cThere\u2019s no armor against fate.\u201d (James Shirley).\n\nWhat we learn from the antics of the prophets against President Buhari is that no man ever has the final say. God is the ultimate decider. If man says anything, and God has not concurred, then nothing happens. Let that man move from mountain to mountain, praying that his prophecy should come to pass, it would be like beating a dead horse. Sheer waste of energy.\n\nServe your God. Show malice to none. Plot and do no evil, and let\u2019s see the negative prophecy that would come to pass against you. That\u2019s an eternal lesson we learn from our President.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, the prophetic ministry is divine, ordained by God. \u201cBy a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.\u201d (Hosea 12: 13). But let nobody begin to posture as if he has the final say, the power to foretell, and it remains inviolable. Only God has the final say, and He is full of mercy and compassion.\n\nI used to open my doors to one young prophet years back. I liked his knowledge of Scriptures, and ability to pray fervently. Whenever he asked for an appointment, I obliged. Of course, I didn\u2019t always believe everything he said, but I was helpful to him in ways I could. Till about this time of a certain year. Maybe he felt it was time for him to finally have me under his armpit, control my life totally. So he came with a number of frightful prophecies for that year. I listened to him calmly, and he left. The Good Book says; \u201cBut he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement and comfort.\u201d (1 Corinthians 14:3). He had come to do otherwise.\n\nThat was the last he has seen me till date. He has phoned hundreds of times, begged, pleaded, made requests, I\u2019ve not obliged him once. He attempted to merchandise with the gift of God, and he picked on a wrong man. So also do these prophets pick on the wrong person, when they come attempting to cow and frighten our President.\n\nIn about 17 months, President Buhari would land safely, as God wills. He would finish his tenure in a blaze of glory, and retire to Daura to tend his cattle. That is the prayer of millions of good people. Let no so-called prophet attempt to hoodwink or browbeat us to the contrary. Who has the final say? Jehovah has the final say.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "title": "Stop using military uniforms for your campaign posters, DHQ warns govs, others",
          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Defence Headquarters(DHQ), has frowned against the use of military uniforms and accoutrements by some state governors, politicians and unauthorized persons to produce their campaign posters.\n\nThe DHQ, warned that that the military allowed governors and other Very Important Personalities (VIP) to wear military uniforms during military training exercises, does not make them military officers overnight to use the uniforms whenever they want to.\n\nIt has therefore warned those who have used their pictures in military uniforms to produce their campaign posters to remove them or have themselves to blame.\n\nActing Director Defence Information, Air Commodore Maigida, who gave the warning in a statement entitled \u201cWearing of military uniforms by unauthorised persons and politicians for electioneering campaign posters is illegal\u201d said: \u201cThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has noticed with dismay that some politicians have formed the habit of wearing military uniforms and accoutrements for electioneering campaign posters.\n\n\u201cThe campaign posters of some governors, dressed in military camouflage uniforms, are displayed in noticeable areas in their respective states. This is manifestly illegal and an abuse of the privilege of allowing civilians wear military uniforms during military training exercises.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to restate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria, as a professional institution, remains apolitical and, as such, would not want to be dragged into any form of political bias. Accordingly, it is important to advise politicians and others to desist from the use of military uniforms and accoutrements for political events and other engagements henceforth. Please note, anyone found culpable in this regard would be liable to prosecution.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, troops reportedly killed 1,910 criminal elements including terrorists, bandits, robbers and kidnappers across the country between May 20, 2021 and January 6, 2022.\n\nDHQ\u2019s acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Major General Bernard Onyeuko, at the biweekly update on Armed Forces of Nigeria operations across the country, yesterday, added that troops rescued 729 kidnap victims. He said the feat was in addition to scores of other terrorists and armed bandits killed during airstrikes within the period.\n\nGen.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, said political solution was inevitable in the matter between the Federal Government and leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nReacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent statement that the court should be left to handle Kanu\u2019s case without any interference, it said Igbo agitation was beyond the IPOB leader.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the the apex Igbo body, Alex Ogbonnia, disclosed that the South East Governors and other Igbo leaders would soon secure audience with the president and explain everything regarding their demand for political solution.\n\nHe said that Biafra agitation was part of the general gamut of marginalization of the Igbo.\n\nOgbonnia reasoned that an ordinary pronouncement by the President Buhari could end the whole agitation in the region.\n\n\u201cThere is a pronouncement that Buhari can make today, by then, many of us will now tell Nnamdi, the game is over and it will be easier to tell Nnamdi to drop his line of action. That is what we mean by political solution. But so long as this marginalisation continues, it will be ultimately difficult. So, this is what we call Igbo agitation, IPOB and some others.\n\n\u201cSo, political solution entails creation of Local Government Areas in Nigeria, revenue allocation, the number of representation of our people in the National Assembly and so on and so forth. All these things, we have to look at them. That is what we call political solution. By the time we begin to address some of these things, the issue of agitation will reduce. It will also attenuate the agitation and the issue of Nnamdi Kanu will be wittled because all of us will tell him. Assuming the President made a statement to say it is the turn of Igbo to produce the President, you\u2019ll see that there will be colouration, there will be a change, there will be a paradigm shift in the agitation. That is what we are looking at.\n\n\u201cWe are saying that by early this year, we will meet the President and explain to him more the approach we deem necessary for the release of Nnamdi Kanu. That approach is what we call political solution. We have not secured the date for the meeting but surely it will be because we had five committees which have all returned reports. So, we seek audience with the President and by the time he approves a date, it will be made public,\u201d Ogbonnia stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOhanaeze further expressed happiness that the president has responded to its call and that of other well-meaning Nigerians that bandits should be declared terrorists.\n\nIn a separate reaction, the Movement of the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) also condemned President Buhari\u2019s dismissal of a political solution for the release of Kanu.\n\nIts leader, Uchenna Madu, said it was unfortunate that the Nigerian leader gave \u201cpolitical, unguided and insensitive utterances\u201d on the the release of Kanu.\n\nHe said that no amount of frustration or intimidation from Buhari and Federal Government would end Biafra agitation.\n\nHe said the arrest, detention, dehumanisation and traumatic torture of Kanu, including the constant clampdown of Biafra agitators by security forces might seem for some a solution to a problem, but as former US President, Barack Obama said in his 2015 United Nations General Assembly speech, \u201ca government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength; it is showing weakness and it is showing fear.\u201d\n\nMadu said Biafra agitation groups were not the problem but a reaction to the many injustices, exclusion, second class citizenship, born to rule philosophy, marginalisation and other forms of inequality that characterise the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cBuhari in his inner sense of reasoning believes that with his kinsmen occupying the high military positions of service chiefs, including all the most senior military high ranks, he will easily crush Biafra. Maybe, with his intimidating tendencies over Igbo governors, National Assembly members, religious, opinion, political leaders, he still thinks he can crush Biafra.\n\n\u201cMASSOB views Buhari\u2019s constant negative comments on Biafra consciousness as a sign of jittery and unsteadiness. As every revolutionary struggle has its own methodology, the current Biafran struggle for actualisation and restoration will continue to unfold confusing methods to President Buhari. The spirit of Biafranism will continue to hunt Hausa Fulani people. Nigeria\u2019s days of existence are numbered.\u201d",

So, this issue of South East having the presidential slot is not negotiable,\u201d Ogba said.\n\nOn his part, PDP National Vice Chairman, South East, Ali Odefa, said Anyim has set the pace and urged others from the zone to follow suit.\n\nOdefa said: \u201cAs party people, we are supposed to be father to all, so, let us encourage our people to join the race but like Anyim said, Nigerians will decide. But must all know that ours is ours.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Anyim said the challenge before the PDP was how to deliver on the expectations of Nigerians to rebuild the nation; protect lives and property; restore the respect of Nigeria within the comity of nations; realign the political structure of Nigeria to reflect the current realities; revive the economy and save the naira; rebuild the broken down social fabric; create jobs for the youths and rehabilitate the collapsing educational systems.\n\nNoting that the above tasks were no mean ones, Anyim said it required one with the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the party to accomplish the tasks.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been privileged to understand our national problems and appreciate their enormity and peculiarities in the last 21 years from my vantage positions in both the legislative and the executive arms of government. Therefore, I have a clear view of the task ahead as well as the solutions needed to advance the cause of our country.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, with a sense of humility, that I step out as a Nigerian with patriotic fervour, considerable knowledge of our country \u2013 its diversities and current challenges; and so properly equipped with clarity of the needed solutions.\n\n\u201cFrom my consultations so far, I am glad to report that the responses have been overwhelmingly encouraging and inspiring.

          "title": "Buhari Warns APC of Consequences of Disunity",
          "text": "*Says corrupt defectors will not be spared\n\n*Declares no leader would foist leadership on ruling party\n\n*Admits age has taken its toll on him\n\nDeji Elumoye and Wale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has warned the leadership of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), of what may happen if they fail to close ranks to project the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. Buhari said without unity of purpose among the leaders and other party members, APC might lose to the opposition.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday during an interview aired by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).\n\nBuhari also assured that those defecting from the opposition parties to APC, with corruption charges hanging over their heads, would have their day in the court of law.\n\nHe foreclosed the possibility of anyone in the party foisting leadership on members.\n\nThe president gave the warning to the leaders of his party while answering a question on the disagreement within the APC leadership, which was believed to be threatening the anticipated national convention of the party, earlier scheduled for this February.\n\nBuhari, who linked his withholding of assent to the recently passed Electoral Act Amendment Bill to the need to give people and political parties the power of choice to determine the system that suits them, also said the APC should be structured bottom-up.\n\nAccording to him, there is need for a system in the ruling party, where the people would be allowed to choose their preferred candidate from polling unit to ward, to council area, to the state, then to the national levels.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cWe have timeframe we have to work, because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then, the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off; they are still off, they can see it.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituencies they will know their positions. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after, Abuja. So, those who want to the elected at any level, let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody.\u201d\n\nCommenting on insinuations that politicians from the opposition with corruption cases had been defecting to the ruling party because of the belief that they would get immunity from prosecution, Buhari said no corrupt politician would go scot-free under his watch, even as members of his party.\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people, who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people to even be corrupt.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused, but luckily, I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels.\n\n\u201cBehave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarrelling, and a lot of noise\u201d.\n\nBuhari also addressed the security challenges facing the country. However, he expressed optimism that the situation could be resolved before he leaves office, pointing out that the security forces are working hard on it, just as more equipment and ammunition are being procured.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it, because members of the security, the armed forces and others, their own security depends on one Nigeria. So, no matter, when people are selfish, it is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the North-east and South-south and how much progress we have made.\u201d\n\nHe said the government had acquired some helicopters, aircraft, and armoured cars, and their ammunition to enhance security across the country.\n\nOn how age had affected his capacity as president, he said the pressure of office had been tremendous, but noted that he could not complain, because he asked to be elected into the office.\n\nHe observed that many of his colleagues were now enjoying their retirement, and hoped to emulate them in the next 17 months, when his tenure would end.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cI think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that needs to see you, can\u2019t see you. I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I, too, would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cAge is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week. So, really, it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d\n\nOn his readiness to hand over power, Buhari said, \u201cYes, because, look, as you know, I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as president. So, I have gone through the system and really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave, Nigerians will reflect and at least, show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the South-east now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing. We closed the border with Benin, we closed the border with Niger. But we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armouries, police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now.\u201d\n\nRegarding the fight against corruption, the president urged the citizens to live within their means, saying there would always be challenges, when people try to cut corners.\n\nHe also said power generation was critical to the success of his administration, adding that the federal government is figuring how to better utilise solar panel as alternative means of generating power to conventional power, which is expensive and liable to sabotage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, told President Muhammadu Buhari to perish the thought of pushing forward a successor, saying Nigerians would firmly reject anyone from him and his All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 presidential election. The main opposition party berated Buhari for embarrassing his office and making a joke of himself by appearing confused and dwelling on false figures and bogus performance claims during his Channels Television interview on Wednesday.\n\nPDP made the assertions in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom commended the Buhari administration for heeding his call and finally labelling bandits terrorists, but said, \u201cThis is not enough.\u201d Ortom called on the president to be bold enough to go a step further and declare also as terrorists the widely known violent organisations among his Fulani ethnic group, like Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association ofNigeria (MACBAN), and Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), just as he had done to other groups.\n\nPDP said the president should have used the interview to show remorse and apologise to Nigerians for his serial misgovernance.\n\nPDP said, \u201cWhile we understand that lying is the standard gauge of performance of the APC, it is rather unfortunate that the president is also in that frame. It only reinforces the fact that nobody is immune to lying in the APC. Of course, he cannot extricate himself because lying is the official policy of his party, the APC.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Buhari, in his ludicrous attempt to rationalise his failures, falsely claimed that under the PDP, from 1999 to 2014, crude oil sold for an average of $100 per barrel but collapsed to $37 per barrel, when he and his APC assumed office.\n\n\u201cSuch false claim flies in the face of hard fact as the records, which the president must have, clearly show that when the PDP took office on May 29, 1999, crude oil sold at $16.27 per barrel and at about $80.42 and $63.28 by November and December 2014 respectively,\u201d Ologunagba stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cUnder President Buhari and the APC, oil price has never fallen as low as $16 per barrel as recorded under the PDP but started at $37 to $39.44 per barrel in 2016 and had continued to hover between $60 to $70 per barrel to date.\u201d\n\nPDP said it was on record that despite the low oil revenue, when the PDP took over, it expanded the economy, paid off the foreign debts, revamped the productive sectors, provided conducive investment environment, which encouraged massive foreign investments, and handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) to President Buhari and the APC in 2015.\n\n\u201cMr. President had no answers when, in the Channels TV interview, he was confronted with the facts that when he took over, the debt stock was N12 trillion but now N32 trillion and counting; that inflation, which was about nine per cent under the PDP is now over 15 per cent; that unemployment rate, which was about 8.9 per cent is now 33 per cent, that our naira, which exchanged about N197 to a dollar under the PDP is now over N500, and that the petrol price, which was N87 in 2015 is now N165 per litre under the APC watch.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should have seized the opportunity provided by Channels TV to show remorse, apologise to Nigerians for his monumental failure and national embarrassment that the APC government represents instead of trying to rationalise APC\u2019s failures with falsehood and grandstanding about a successor.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party explained that the mindset of the president, as exhibited in the Channels TV interview, confirmed the fears of Nigerians that APC did not believe in democratic practice and was determined to manipulate the 2023 election by all means. This, PDP stated, explained APC\u2019s desperation to scuttle the Electoral Act Amendment Bill provision for electronic transmission of election results, which will effectively truncate its plans to rig the 2023 election.\n\nPDP said Buhari and APC must know that Nigerians were fully rallied on the platform of PDP to face them in 2023 and the resort to underhand processes and false indices, like those reeled off by the president in the Channels interview, would not avail them.\n\nOrtom Wants Miyetti Allah, Fulani Movement Declared as Terrorist Groups\n\nThe Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, applauded the Buhari administration for heeding his appeal and finally declaring bandits terrorists. But ortom said the president must be bold enough to move a step further to also label some well known violent Fulani groups as terrorists.\n\nThe governor was reacting to the Buhari interview on Channels TV. Ortom said the step taken by the federal government would go a long way in containing the atrocities of the criminals and give innocent citizens the opportunity to go about their legitimate businesses unmolested.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cEven though the federal government\u2019s measures on bandits now seem strong, the security challenges will only be adequately addressed if similar hard position is taken on Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, MACBAN and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), who have vowed and continued to cause mayhem in Benue State and other parts of the country, because of the anti-grazing laws.\n\n\u201cFor us in Benue State, the law has come to stay. It is irrevocable. In fact, we have maintained our position that Benue State has no grazing routes, reserves or areas whatsoever. It was enacted in good faith for peace and order in the state. It was done, among other things, to end the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.\u201d\n\nOrtom also tasked the president to do everything necessary to revamp the ailing economy and save the citizens from poverty. He said, \u201cNigerians have absorbed enough hunger and misery in the hands of the All Progressives Congress (APC) misrule. Or is it possible that Mr. President is not aware that Nigerians are dying from his misrule?\u201d\n\nThe governor dismissed the president\u2019s classification of PDP as a failure, insisting, \u201cAs a critical stakeholder of the PDP, this is completely false. If anyone has failed, it is the Buhari-led APC federal government that has failed by taking Nigeria from top to bottom.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is ready to rescue Nigeria from the insecurity and economic horror placed on Nigerians by the APC.\u201d\n\nOrtom stressed that the party was better prepared with laudable programmes on the welfare of Nigerians and to rebuild the country from the APC tale of woes.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Private Sector Operators Reject Introduction of Excise Duty on Non-alcoholic, Sweetened Beverages",
          "text": "*Insist sector may lose N1.9trn\n\nGilbert Ekugbe\n\nSome members of the organised private sector yesterday kicked against the federal government\u2019s introduction of an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages in the country. They argued that the policy would be an additional cost burden to producers of the product, and expressed concerns that it might lead to job losses.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN); Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA); Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI); and Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE) said they were worried by the deleterious economic consequences of the new excise duty.\n\nMAN lamented that despite the obviously overwhelming negative effect, the federal government was more interested in the revenue gains from the excise duty and was only trying to explain away the bad policy by linking it to citizens\u2019 health.\n\nThe manufacturers made their position known in a statement obtained by THISDAY.\n\nThe association stated that the reintroduction of the excise duty would cause the beverage sub-sector of the food and beverage industry to lose up to N1.9 trillion in sales revenue between 2022 and 2025. This, it estimated, would be a 39.5 per cent loss, due to imposition of new taxes with concomitant effect on jobs and supply chain businesses.\n\nAccording to Director General of MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, the revenue aspirations of government in introducing the excise may not be justified in the long-run.\n\nAjayi-Kadir stated, \u201cLet us look at it this way: the government is estimated to generate an excise tax of N81 billion between 2022 and 2025 from the group. This will not be sufficient to compensate the corresponding government\u2019s revenue losses in other taxes from the group.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the corresponding effect of reduced industry revenue on government revenues is estimated to be up to N142 billion contraction in Value Added Tax (VAT) raised by the sector and N54 billion Company Income Tax (CIT) reduction between 2022 and 2025.\n\n\u201cIt would appear that the goose that lays the golden eggs is being led to perdition. Seeing that the affected sub-sector has contributed most significantly to the economy and taxes, despite the debilitating impact of naira devaluation, inadequacy of forex and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe food and beverage sector contributed the highest, 38 per cent, of the total manufacturing sector contribution to the GDP. It comprises 22.5 per cent of manufacturing jobs and generates more than 1.5 million jobs. So, this excise duty would certainly cast a sunset to this performance.\u201d\n\nThe MAN director general said recent studies had shown that introducing excise on non-alcoholic beverages was likely to cause a 0.43 per cent contraction in output and about 40 per cent drop in total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nDescribing the impact on manufacturers and the supply chain, he stressed that excise duty resulted in high production costs, which adversely affected production levels, and, ultimately, led to dwindling profits. He said the introduction of excise would grossly affect the small and emerging business owners in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\n\nAjayi-Kadir added, \u201cNigeria is the sixth highest consumer of soft drinks, but per capita consumption is low. Introducing excise will easily reduce production capacity, causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\u201d\n\nThe director general noted that a decrease in production levels or ability to purchase raw materials as a result of the introduction of excise would also result in reduced profits for the supply chain players in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOne is particularly worried about the ripple effect of the introduction of the excise, despite strenuous evidence-based advice to the contrary. This will have unpleasant impact on employment, households and consumers.\n\n\u201cAs seen from previous impact analyses, excise affects production outputs, revenues, and profits. This causes companies to pursue cost-cutting measures to reduce the effect of diminishing revenue and profits by reducing employee salaries or retrenchment.\u201d\n\nAjayi-Kadir stated that presently, the country\u2019s unemployment rate was about 33.3 per cent, with projections to increase even further. He warned that a further cut in jobs for an industry that employed over 1.5 million people directly and indirectly could worsen the unemployment position in the country and result in an increase in social vices and moral decadence.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere will certainly be decline in private households/ consumers purchasing power, as they earn income mostly by supplying labour to the industry and from owning a share in industry capital. Households, in turn, use this earned income to purchase food, shelter and products from the manufacturing firms. Introduction of an additional tax will cause manufacturers, in a bid to offset tax and maintain profit, to raise prices of their products to higher rates, thus, shifting tax incident to consumers.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Director General, LCCI, Chinyere Almona, said the chamber\u2019s immediate concern was the likely increase in prices, which could lead to a decrease in demand and, consequently, loss of jobs due to a reduction in production activities.\n\nAlmona said, \u201cIf the president insists he wants it, we have to oblige him. The prohibition on imported drinks should be better enforced to protect domestic production from unfair competition in the face of the high cost of production in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe noted that LCCI supported both the government\u2019s revenue drive and the pro-health considerations of several stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe, however, recommend that the realised revenue from these levies be channelled into improving the country\u2019s grossly inadequate health infrastructure,\u201d she stated.\n\n\u201cThe allocation to the health sector in the 2022 federal budget of N876 billion should be reviewed upward to the region of a trillion Naira invested into the sector in the next 10 years,\u201d she added.\n\nAlmona said the chamber was also concerned about the government\u2019s stance on enforcement of revenue targets on government-owned enterprises.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe operations of these Government-Owned Enterprises (GOEs) should not build up into a hostile business environment where the private sector will find it challenging to thrive. And beyond the levying of taxes on carbonated drinks to force a reduction in consumption, we urge the various public health agencies to regulate the production of sugary drinks to reduce their negative effect on human health.\u201d\n\nDirector General, NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayoola Olukani, said the introduction of the excise duty by the federal government was ill-timed, stating that the excuse given that it would discourage young people drinking is incorrect.\n\nOlukani stated, \u201cThat is a culture that has been developed. It is not a good direction to go at all and we sincerely hope that they would reconsider.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of CPPE, Muda Yusuf, said the introduction of the excise was a negation of the economic recovery and job creation aspirations of the federal government. Yusuf stressed that many upcoming small businesses in the beverage sector would be hard hit by this policy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe millions of micro enterprises in the soft drinks\u2019 distribution chain will be adversely impacted by the imposition of the excise. This is detrimental to the job creation and poverty reduction commitment of Mr. President.\u201d\n\nYusuf added that Nigerian manufacturing companies and, indeed, most investors were going through tremendous stress at the moment.\n\nHe said concerning the manufacturers and investors, \u201cThey are currently grappling with serious macro-economic challenges and structural constraints impacting on capacity utilisation, productivity, and competitiveness. This is affecting sales, turnover, profitability, shareholder value, and the sustainability of investments. The norm globally at this time is to provide incentives for industries to aid their recovery from the shocks of the pandemic and escalating costs.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to be doing the exact opposite. Manufacturers across all product segments need a respite, especially in the light of the unprecedented escalation of production and operating costs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says succession plan unambiguous, concedes to Balogun\n\n*Urges Olubadan-in-waiting, other chiefs to withdraw their court cases\n\n*Obasanjo visits family of late monarch, assures them of support\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nIn a move that seem to have calmed the controversies relating to the choice of a new Olubadan of Ibadanland, a former governor of Oyo State and Osi Olubadan, Senator Rasheed Ladoja, yesterday, broke his silence on the issue, saying uninformed people are causing unnecessary tension in Ibadan over the succession.\n\nLadoja conceded to the choice of High Chief Lekan Balogun as the most senior person to succeed the late Oba Saliu Adetunji as the new Olubadan. But the former governor pleaded with the monarch-in-waiting and other high chiefs to withdraw their cases in court so that the matter could be completely laid to rest.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo visited the family of the late Olubadan yesterday to commiserate with them, and the people and government of Oyo State over Adetunji\u2019s passing.\n\nOba Adetunji died at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, last Sunday at the age of 93 years.\n\nLadoja spoke while playing host to some visitors, including the senator for Oyo Central senatorial district, Senator Teslim Folarin, at his Ondo Street, Bodija residence, in Ibadan. He said High Chief Balogun was the next in line to succeed the departed Olubadan.\n\nLadoja said, \u201cUninformed people are just causing unnecessary tensions in Ibadan. There is no controversy about who becomes the next Olubadan after the demise of Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso 1.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the controversy that arose over the next Olubadan should not have arisen, as the succession plan was clear and unambiguous.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is no controversy about it. Egbon Lekan Balogun is the most senior in our line and so, he is the next in line to the throne. For those asking, my \u2018body and mouth language\u2019 is that Egbon Lekan is my senior and he is next in line to the Olubadan stool.\n\n\u201cI do not have the powers to make anybody Olubadan. In 2017, we instituted a case to challenge the needless reform that Abiola Ajimobi, as governor, wanted to do. Almost all of us as High Chiefs and members of the Olubadan-in-Council agreed to the filing of a suit to challenge him and we gave the task to Michael Lana.\n\n\u201cLana later called me to say some of the High Chiefs told him to remove their names from the suit, leaving only my Egbon Balogun and myself. Two weeks after we started the case, Egbon Balogun said he was no longer interested in the case. I asked Lana if I could do it alone and he told me \u2018yes\u2019 and we continued.\n\n\u201cWe won the case at the State High Court and Ajimobi appealed. In a judgement, the appeal court, a few days to the exit of Ajimobi from government, sent the case back to the High Court for retrial. They (judges of the appellate court) said the case was brought under writ of summons instead of originating summons.\n\n\u201cBy the time, there had been a new government headed by Seyi Makinde, who said he did not want the distraction of the suit and called for out-of-court settlement, which we agreed to and did.\n\n\u201cAfter the terms of settlement were agreed to, the court gave a consent judgement based on the terms. But they said they were not happy and instituted two fresh cases, which are still in court till today.\n\n\u201cSo, I need people to understand that I am not causing any trouble. The cases that are in court today in respect of the Obaship tussle were instituted by Egbon Balogun and his colleagues, who are still calling themselves Obas. It is they that the people should talk to. Let them go and withdraw the cases they instituted. I don\u2019t like the unwarranted tension this matter is generating.\u201d\n\nObasanjo, who was a regular visitor to the Popoyemoja palace during the reign of Oba Adetunji, was received by the queen of the monarch, Olori Rasheedat Adetunji, and Chief Nureni Akanbi, who is the Gbonka Balogun of Ibadanland. He arrived at the palace around 7:10am and was accompanied by former Secretary to the Government of Oyo State, Chief Olayiwola Olakojo.\n\nObasanjo, who prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed monarch, assured the palace of his readiness to assist the family whenever the need arose. He wrote in his condolence message, thus, \u201cKabiesi, sun re. You lived for the service of family, community, state and the nation. You served committedly and God granted you longevity. We pray that your soul will be with your Creator and the family and community will continue to thrive.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd) said the performance was as a result of resolute pursuit of what was termed the right and willingness to adapt to changes brought about by global health challenges occasioned by COVID-19.\n\nHe said service revenue generation profile had continued to be on the rise annually as ongoing reforms had focused on strategic deployment of officers strictly using the standard operating procedure, strict enforcement of extant guidelines by the tariff and trade department, automation of the customs process thereby eliminating vices associated with the manual process among other measures.\n\nHe said the service efforts to prevent the entry of items that could compromise the security of citizens, economy and the well-being of people resulted in the seizures of 5,096 assorted items with a duty paid value of N13.79 billion while 160 suspects are at different levels of investigation or prosecution.\n\nThe NCS also listed other landmark achievements in that boosted national security and economy.\n\nThese included the installation of three brand new scanners in Apapa, Tin-Can Island and Onne Ports; introduction of mobile tracker, a mobile application that enables individuals to remotely validate any declaration/payment and most importantly the status of any vehicle/cargo at any point.\n\nOthers included the introduction of Standard Operating Procedure for the use of Scanners; acquisition of rugged, gun trucks to secure anti-smuggling operatives in an increasingly hostile environment as well as e-customs take-off process now at the stage of final signing of agreement.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cAll these are expected to impact positively on trade facilitation, fight smuggling, block revenue leakages and significantly impact on revenue generation and national security.\n\n\u201cNCS management recognizes the selfless efforts of Officers and Men who remained undaunted throughout the year resulting in these achievements.\n\n\u201cIn the light of this, the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd) commends all Officers and Men for their doggedness and charges all to do more in the New Year.\n\n\u201cHe also appreciates and commends the increasing numbers of compliant traders noting that compliance is a patriotic thing to do by citizens who desire a better nation.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cWhile giving the assurances of the Service determination to continuously seek ways of making it easy for stakeholders to comply, the CGC prayed for the repose of the souls of operatives who paid the supreme price in the course of fighting smugglers. The living, he said must sustain the fight in honor of the departed.\n\n\u201cNCS remains totally committed to the course of protecting national security and economy, we call on Nigerians, especially the business community to support the NCS as our borders open to African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) in order to benefit from the trade agreement and other cross border activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Ogun Governor, Abiodun Used \u2018Abuja Influence\u2019 To Stop Anti-graft Agency, EFCC From Interrogating Assembly Speaker, Others Over Multi-billion Naira Fraud",
          "text": "The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun is frustrating the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from interrogating the some State House of Assembly members accused of multi-billion-naira fraud, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nThe governor, according to impeccable sources, is using his \u201cinfluential network in Abuja\u201d to rein in the anti-graft agency from interrogating the state lawmakers, particularly the speaker, Olakunle Oluomo.\n\nOlakunle Oluomo with Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Oluomo is being investigated by EFCC with the Assembly clerk and some former members of the House.\n\nIn a letter obtained in 2021 by SaharaReporters, the anti-graft agency asked the clerk to provide it with information on all budget appropriations and allocations of the House from May 30, 2015 till date.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker and others are under probe for different allegations. First one is financial misappropriation. About N85,000,000 monthly for running cost of the Assembly cannot be accounted for since June 2019 till date by Mr Speaker and Clerk, the approving officer and accounting officer respectively,\u201d a lawmaker had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThis led to a rift between the Speaker and the recently impeached Deputy Speaker after the latter demanded accountability and transparency. Even doing Covid-19 lockdown, running costs such as local/international travel, cost for fuelling the generator were diverted to private accounts.\n\n\u201cDiversion of constituency allowance funds (each member of the 8th Assembly collected N20,000,000 twice between 2015-2019. Most of the retired receipts were forged and fictitious pictures of porputed ghost projects were filed by members. The current Speaker and 3 other current members were part of the 8th Assembly under investigation. A current Special Adviser to the Governor of Ogun state who also has a school certificate scandal case over him, was part of the 8th Assembly under the EFCC radar.\n\n\u201cForgery of Financial Bills (i-The House passed a resolution to approve only N75 billion Bond for the State Government sometime in June 2020, but Speaker secretly falsified the content of the resolution letter in favour of the Executive, changed it to N200 billion after members had already passed and signed resolution for just N75 billion on the floor of the House before the camera.\n\n\u201cSpeaker falsified some contents {S.7(4)} of Ogun State Legislative Funds Management Bill, after passage, for personal/selfish grounds. After the passage on the floor of the House, he falsified the contents in his favour before sending a clean copy to the Government for assent.\n\n\u201cSpeaker in connivance with Mr Clerk, also falsified the current Standing Order of the House before the commencement of the 9th Assembly, to favour his election as the Speaker and disqualified others to contest, amongst other contents.\u201d\n\nDespite the investigation by the Abdulrasheed Bawa-led EFCC, the anti-graft agency is said to be \u201chandicapped\u201d in interrogating the indicted lawmakers, let alone prosecuting them, insider at the EFCC Lagos Zonal office said.\n\nThis development has bolstered the ballooning ego of the speaker who was heard daring EFCC to come after him \u201cif they can.\u201d\n\nOluomo was said to be banking on the unflinching support of Governor Abiodun in return for the cover that the Assembly has provided to the Governor on several allegations of corruption.\n\n\u201cThe governor has reached out to the power-that-be in Abuja and the EFCC investigation will fizzle out,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nIt would be recalled that the former Attorney-General resigned a couple of months ago citing massive corruption against the governor before he was pressured to change the reason to \"personal reason\".\n\nSome of the allegations of corruption against the governor include the massive inflation of the cost of constructing roads such as the Epe to Ijebu-Ode Expressway (which is being tolled for repayment by the public at about thrice the actual cost without any due process) and the resurfaced Shagamu to Abeokuta Road that was executed at higher than the cost of rebuilding.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers are made to believe that EFCC\u2019s Bawa can\u2019t do anything because Governor Dapo Abiodun has reached out to his bosses in Abuja,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\nIt is with this mindset that the lawmakers recently dared the EFCC by refusing to honour the anti-graft agency\u2019s \u201cinvitation for interview/interrogation\u201d scheduled at its Lagos office.\n\nIt was further understood that the speaker is approaching the state High Court to obtain an injunction that would stop the EFCC from pursuing the case.\n\nThe tone of the lawmakers\u2019 letter was riddled with unbridled arrogance and bourgeoning impunity, an EFCC insider said.\n\n\u201cThe lawmakers, in their response to the EFCC\u2019s letter, ended up trying to show the anti-graft agency that it doesn\u2019t even know what it is doing. The EFCC has been rendered as a toothless bulldog as far as the lawmakers' graft case is concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a letter dated December 9, 2021, with a reference No: CR:3000/EFCC/LS/CMU/OG1/VOL.3/165, with a subject: \u2018Investigation activities: Letter of Invitation,\u2019 the EFCC summoned the assembly speaker, the clerk, accountant, account staff, 26 members of the Ogun State House of Assembly and other principal staff for \u201cinvestigative interview/interrogation\u201d at its Lagos office.\n\nThe EFCC, in its letter, asked the Assembly clerk to provide it with information on all budget appropriations and allocations of the House from May 30, 2015, till date.\n\nHowever, based on the assurances from Governor Abiodun, the lawmakers had shunned the EFCC invitation, saying that the invitation was \u201ca potential threat to the good of the Ogun people, and has the tendency to shut down legislative business in Ogun State in critical period.\u201d\n\n\n\nInsiders at the anti-corruption Commission told this newspaper that despite the lawmakers\u2019 impudent reply to the EFCC, \u201cno action was taken. Nothing was done. This is unusual. It is apparent that the EFCC is indeed handicapped.\u201d\n\nThe Ogun lawmakers, through the office of the speaker, sent this reply to the EFCC in a letter dated 13 December 2021, with a reference number: OG/SPK/2021/66.\n\nThe letter was signed by the speaker himself, addressed to the EFCC Deputy Zonal Commander in Lagos, with attention: ACE Emeka Okonjo.\n\nThe lawmakers argued that they wouldn't honour the EFCC invite because they were working on a budget document presented by Governor Abiodun.\n\nThey said \u201cthe House is currently processing several critical and pressing issues of public concern, some of which are in the public domain relating to revenue collection, security, as well as trade and investments.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker clearly stated in the letter to the EFCC that the invitation of the lawmakers \u201cposes a logistical nightmare to members.\u201d\n\nDespite shunning the EFCC, the Speaker instead asked that \u201ca copy of the petition against the House be made available to us, so that we can exercise our right of preparing our defence.\u201d",

          "text": "The 2022 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) kicks off in Cameroon on January 9, with the Super Eagles expected to fly the Nigerian flag high in their opening clash against Egypt next Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a rich love and history of football, Nigeria has had its fair share of hit and misses with the continental tourney. The country has experienced moments of irrepressible joy that saw streets filled with euphoric crowds and hurtful times when the land winces all over in pain after an uncomfortable loss to arch-rivals.\n\nWithout further ado, here are five of those memorable Super Eagles AFCON moments:\n\nMaiden AFCON triumph on home soil\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria made her debut at the tournament in 1963 and didn\u2019t qualify beyond the group stages. But better performances in subsequent editions saw the team finish third in 1976 and 1978. The following edition of the continental tourney, held in Nigeria, was the launchpad where the country announced its footballing talent to the rest of Africa and the world. With revolutionary players like Segun Odegbami, Christian Chukwu, Muda Lawal, Best Ogedengbe, Nigeria cruised to her first AFCON trophy at a packed national stadium in Surulere.\n\nA first-half brace from the electrifying Odegbami was complimented by a stab-in by Lawal in the early minutes of the second half, ensuring a comfortable 3-0 win over Algeria in the final.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTunisia \u201994 and the \u2018golden generation\u2019\n\nAfter that bubbly evening in Lagos in 1980, it will take another 14 years and a pack of insanely talented players, adorably dubbed \u201cgolden generation\u201d by Nigerians, before the country calls itself champions of Africa once again. In a white and black checkered jersey, the Eagles defeated Zambia 2-1 at the Stade El Menzah in Tunis to claim their second AFCON trophy.\n\nEmmanuel Amunike\u2019s brace came fast and was enough to turn the outcome in favour of Nigeria after the country suffered an early goal from Elijah Litana.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIkpeba\u2019s penalty miss in 2000\n\nNigerians will never forget the picture of a crew-cut wearing Victor Ikpeba with hands on his head as the referee Mourad Daami signalled that his penalty, which subsequent TV replays showed clearly crossed the line, was missed.\n\nAgonizingly, it was in front of thousands of Nigerian fans that filled the national stadium in Surulere to its floodlights. They were all expecting the Super Eagles to win another AFCON trophy on home soil like they did in 1980. The Lions punctured the excitement with two first-half goals from Samuel Eto\u2019o and Wilfred Mboma, but Jay-Jay Okocha dragged the Eagles back into the game before Chukwu Nduweke restored parity \u2014 leading the game to a penalty shootout.\n\nNwankwo Kanu and Ikpeba were the only two that missed theirs as Cameroun stunned the over 30,000 Nigerian fans at the stadium in broad daylight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ufeff\n\nSweet revenge against Cameroon in 2004\n\nThe Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, the then defending champions, had basked in the era of a deep-rooted dominance of African football. As ever, Nigeria had a constellation of superstars who could cause havoc to opposition teams.\n\nBut there was another subplot to this clash in Monastir, Tunisia. Jay Jay Okocha, the BBC African footballer of the year, was apparently shunned by CAF, which handed the footballer of the year award to Cameroon\u2019s Samuel Eto\u2019o, and subtly, it was a battle for supremacy between these two African stars. Amazingly, both players scored, and their goals came with just five minutes difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEto\u2019o scored first from a counterattack after the Eagles defence was slit open by Geremi\u2019s pass, and Jay Jay replied almost immediately, curling in a freekick that left Idris Kameni rooted to his spot. The game was sealed, and the hegemony of Cameroon on African football was broken when Nwankwo Kanu languidly put a through-ball to John Utaka, whose firm shot ricocheted in off the upright.\n\n\ufeff\n\n3-star Eagles\n\nAfter almost two decades of near misses and a series of third-place finishes, Super Eagles eventually won their third AFCON trophy in front of teeming fans at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg. All it took was a half-volley from the right boot of Sunday Mba, which dinked over Daouda Diakite and nestled into the far corner. The late Stephen Keshi became only the second man to lift the trophy as a player and as a coach after Egyptian Mahmoud El Gohary. He was also the country\u2019s last captain to lift the cup until that Sunday night in Jo\u2019burg.",

In a white and black checkered jersey, the Eagles defeated Zambia 2-1 at the Stade El Menzah in Tunis to claim their second AFCON trophy.\n\nEmmanuel Amunike\u2019s brace came fast and was enough to turn the outcome in favour of Nigeria after the country suffered an early goal from Elijah Litana.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIkpeba\u2019s penalty miss in 2000\n\nNigerians will never forget the picture of a crew-cut wearing Victor Ikpeba with hands on his head as the referee Mourad Daami signalled that his penalty, which subsequent TV replays showed clearly crossed the line, was missed.\n\nAgonizingly, it was in front of thousands of Nigerian fans that filled the national stadium in Surulere to its floodlights. They were all expecting the Super Eagles to win another AFCON trophy on home soil like they did in 1980. The Lions punctured the excitement with two first-half goals from Samuel Eto\u2019o and Wilfred Mboma, but Jay-Jay Okocha dragged the Eagles back into the game before Chukwu Nduweke restored parity \u2014 leading the game to a penalty shootout.\n\nNwankwo Kanu and Ikpeba were the only two that missed theirs as Cameroun stunned the over 30,000 Nigerian fans at the stadium in broad daylight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ufeff\n\nSweet revenge against Cameroon in 2004\n\nThe Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, the then defending champions, had basked in the era of a deep-rooted dominance of African football. As ever, Nigeria had a constellation of superstars who could cause havoc to opposition teams.\n\nBut there was another subplot to this clash in Monastir, Tunisia. Jay Jay Okocha, the BBC African footballer of the year, was apparently shunned by CAF, which handed the footballer of the year award to Cameroon\u2019s Samuel Eto\u2019o, and subtly, it was a battle for supremacy between these two African stars. Amazingly, both players scored, and their goals came with just five minutes difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEto\u2019o scored first from a counterattack after the Eagles defence was slit open by Geremi\u2019s pass, and Jay Jay replied almost immediately, curling in a freekick that left Idris Kameni rooted to his spot. The game was sealed, and the hegemony of Cameroon on African football was broken when Nwankwo Kanu languidly put a through-ball to John Utaka, whose firm shot ricocheted in off the upright.\n\n\ufeff\n\n3-star Eagles\n\nAfter almost two decades of near misses and a series of third-place finishes, Super Eagles eventually won their third AFCON trophy in front of teeming fans at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg. All it took was a half-volley from the right boot of Sunday Mba, which dinked over Daouda Diakite and nestled into the far corner. The late Stephen Keshi became only the second man to lift the trophy as a player and as a coach after Egyptian Mahmoud El Gohary. He was also the country\u2019s last captain to lift the cup until that Sunday night in Jo\u2019burg.",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\n2022 predictions for the fintech industry\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Clubhouse-like platform\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2m fund\n\nWhat does 2022 hold for the fintech industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, Africa has seen rapid growth in the fintech industry. In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "text": "At least five Nigerian oil and gas companies are preparing to submit bids this month for Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s onshore oilfields in a sale that could fetch up to $3 billion, three sources involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nShell started talks with the Nigerian government last year about selling its stake in the West African country\u2019s onshore fields, where it has been active since the 1930s, as part of a global drive to reduce its carbon emissions.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has stakes in 19 oil mining leases in Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (SPDC), which the industry and banking sources said were valued at $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nShell operates SPDC (Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria) and holds a 30% stake in the venture. The state\u2019s Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds 55%, TotalEnergies has 10% and ENI 5%.\n\nShell has also struggled for years with spills in the Niger Delta due to pipeline theft and sabotage as well as operational issues, leading to costly repairs and high-profile lawsuits.\n\nThe sale has drawn interest from independent Nigerian oil and gas firms including Seplat Energy, Sahara Group, Famfa Oil, Troilus Investments Limited and Nigeria Delta Exploration and Production (NDEP), the sources said.\n\nRead also: How oil-dependence truncated Nigeria\u2019s industrial development\n\nNo international oil companies were expected to take part in the bidding process at this point, the sources said, adding that bids were due by Jan. 31.\n\nA Shell spokesman declined to comment. Sahara Group said it did not comment on market speculation. Seplat, Famfa, Troilus and NDEP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nState-controlled NNPC could also choose to exercise its right to pre-empt any sale to a third company, the sources said.\n\nThey said it was unclear whether potential bidders could raise sufficient funds as many international banks and investors have become wary about oil and gas assets in Nigeria due to concerns about environmental issues and corruption.\n\nThere is a significant reduction in the financing of fossil assets around the world although some African and Asian banks, however, are still willing to finance fossil fuel operations in the region, they said.\n\nTroilus has hired Nigeria-focused Africa Bridge Capital Management to raise up to $3 billion for the assets, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.

          "title": "EXPLAINER: The Metaverse and the untapped potential of NFTs",
          "text": "When Mark Zuckerberg on October 28, 2021, changed his company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta, he introduced most of the world to the concept of the Metaverse.\n\nSome news outlets portrayed the metaverse as a dystopian future in which people would transform into mindless robots in virtual reality\n\nTo describe the Metaverse today is to compare it to the internet in the 1990s. There was no idea of social media, content providers, sharing platforms, trade systems, or any of the other features that make up the internet today. As a result, the Metaverse is defined as whatever we construct on top of it. Web 3.0, blockchain NFTs, and virtual reality all intersect to make up the metaverse. These three factors are what allow the metaverse to exist.\n\nWeb 3.0\n\nWeb 1.0 was basically pages with a bunch of text and a few hyperlinks to other pages with even more text. There is no interactivity, no user-generated content, and the content consists primarily of words on a screen. The current state of the internet is known as Web 2.0. It\u2019s mostly a community-based platform, with a lot of user-generated content and engagement.\n\nIn web 3.0 which is the next version of the internet, the most important thing is to own a piece of the internet unlike previous versions of the web that only allows you to own a domain name. In Web 3.0 everything you buy, sell or make on the internet is yours, and you have full rights and complete ownership. This is made feasible by blockchain and more specifically non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nBlockchain NFTs\n\nNFTs are certificates of authenticity and ownership based on \u2018blockchain\u2019 technology, a tamper-proof system that also authenticates transactions. Because NFTs cannot be copied or altered, they are well suited to tracking ownership of non-replicable property, such as the rights to a picture or a plot of land. NFTs are the foundation blocks of value in the metaverse.\n\nTo better understand the values of NFTs and how they work, let\u2019s talk about the concept of money. The idea of money is a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange. It is the medium in which prices and values are expressed and over the year we trust N5 naira note to be worth N5 likewise other naira notes with a higher value placed on them. This is a social construct and makes it easier to exchange goods and services and we agree to use them.\n\nThe value of an NFT is determined by how much its owners believe it is worth, and it offers ownership because it can be recorded in the blockchain, making it impossible to copy.\n\nRead also: Windfall Technologies wants to bring Africa\u2019s real estate into the metaverse\n\nVirtual reality (VR)\n\nEven though it is only a component of the metaverse, virtual reality appears to be the most popular of the three. It\u2019s a computer-generated world featuring realistic-looking scenes and objects that make the viewer feel immersed in their surroundings. This environment can only be experienced with the help of a virtual reality headset.\n\nIndividual ownership\n\nOnce blockchain becomes mainstream, the internet will be owned by individuals through NFTs. Here is an example, imagine you\u2019re an artist and you make one song and sell it for $1 as an NFT, in your smart contract you can quote that each time your song gets sold, you make 80 percent that goes to your digital wallet with 20 percent going to the seller\u2019s digital wallets. Keep in mind the transactions are done using cryptocurrency.\n\nLet\u2019s say we buy your song for $1 and sell it to someone else for $1; in this case, you as an artist make $1 from the first sale and 80 cents from the second sale, while we make 20 cents, and this could continue as long as the song is trending, people like it, and it sells.Every time your music is sold for whatever amount, you automatically receive 80 percent of the proceeds in your digital wallet. There are no streaming platforms or record labels involved; just you as an artist, and your music generating money for you in the metaverse, and not only do you make a lot more money, but your community does as well.\n\nThis is how individual ownership develops, and everything in the metaverse follows this formula, which is what the metaverse is all about: individual ownership\u2019s rise.\n\nTo profit from this, you need to become a native in this new community, you need to understand how they are created to see these new opportunities. If you have no idea of how it all works and quickly dismiss it as a dystopian nightmare, you\u2019ll probably be left behind. The good news is that we are just at the early stages and people are starting to get educated in this space.\n\nSporting brand Adidas stepped into the world of the metaverse by launching its first collection of NFTs in December that can be purchased in cryptocurrency, which will initially give \u201cexclusive access\u201d to digital accessories that can be used in the Windows video game The Sandbox. Nike also announced on 13 December the acquisition of RTFKT, a digital fashion start-up that also relies on the blockchain.",

          "title": "Agric growth under Buhari weakest since 1999 despite investment",
          "text": "Of the four presidents who have led Nigeria since 1999, at no point has its agriculture sector reached its lowest ebb than between 2015 and 2020, despite investments made by the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration, data from the country\u2019s statistics agency show.\n\nIn his Channels TV interview Wednesday, President Buhari failed to engage questions about Nigeria\u2019s woeful economic indicators, but rather insisted that to fix the economy Nigerians must return to the farm.\n\nResponding to apt data reeled out concerning Nigeria\u2019s soaring debt stock, spiralling inflation and rising unemployment, President Buhari said, \u201cWell, I am not sure how correct your calculations are, but all I know is that we have to allow people to have access to the farm. We just have to go back to the land.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s message to Nigeria is a simple one: his government will fix infrastructure by building functional rails and accessible roads and reap the benefits by having a vibrant agricultural sector with more farm produce gaining easier penetration across the country.\n\nDespite the rhetoric about investment in the agriculture and bolder commitment to infrastructure the sector has grown at the weakest rate under the Buhari administration since the return of democracy in 1999, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Statisense, a data consulting firm.\n\nThe sector grew at an average of 10.48 percent between 2016 and 2020, the lowest since 1999.\n\nBy comparison, the sector averaged 18.79 percent between 2011 and 2015 under former President Goodluck Jonathan, while between 2006 and 2010, a period that covers the tail end of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and late Musa Yar\u2019 Adua, the sector recorded an average growth of 27.6 percent.\n\n\u201cBeyond what the government has done, there is still a lot more to do. The issue of insecurity has to be addressed, transportation cost also needs to be addressed,\u201d the immediate past director-general of Nigeria\u2019s largest business think tank, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Muda Yusuf said.\n\nFurther analysis shows between 2001 and 2005, under the Obasanjo\u2019s administration the sector had a historic average growth of 89.41 percent thereafter nosedived to 17 percent between 1995 and 2000, 10.7 percent from 1991 to 1995, 16 percent between 1986 and 1990, 15.5 percent between 1981 and 1985, etc.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about growing crops, it is about dealing with the entire value chain, we need to strengthen the value chain,\u201d Yusuf told BusinessDay via phone.\n\nRead also: Buhari tells Nigerian youths not to rely on FG for jobs\n\nIn terms of the agricultural sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP, the Buhari administration has so far done better than only the Jonathan administration, based on an analysis by Statisense.\n\nUnder Buhari\u2019s administration between 2016 and 2020, the sector contributed an average of 25.06 percent to the country\u2019s GDP, while under Jonathan\u2019s administration between 2011 and 2015; the sector contributed an average of 23.03 percent.\n\nThe government needs to prioritise the use of technology and pay less focus of crude farm implements, Yusuf noted.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be using hoes and cutlasses to feed over 200 million people. It is not just about feeding, it is also about exporting. Agriculture is supposed to be one of our areas of comparative advantage,\u201d Yusuf pointed out.\n\nAccording to Ken Ife, an economic policy analyst for the World Bank and UNIDO, a lot still needs to be done, especially in meeting local demands for consumer goods both as a lifestyle essential and as an important driver of economic activity.\n\n\u201cThe consumer goods sector, like others, is having its fair share of pandemic induced challenges including forex scarcity, rising inflation and import bottlenecks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese, combined with a shrinking disposable income, have made many foreign products, which hitherto posed a fierce competition to local players, out of reach for many consumers,\u201d he stated.\n\nJohn Akerele, an agribusiness expert, said Nigeria was currently experiencing extremely high food inflation rate largely because of insecurity and the poor economic situation.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in the North, where most of the agricultural produce from Nigeria comes from, has prevented farmers from going to the farm.\n\n\u201cWhen farmers can\u2019t farm at the large scale they usually would, it means harvest will be lean and there will be limited produce which more money will then be required to purchase,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite boasting about massive infrastructural allocation, BusinessDay analysis also shows that the Buhari government has been big on talk about infrastructure spending but small on actual expenditure.\n\nFor instance, the government budgeted N1.58 trillion and N2.17 trillion for capital expenditure in 2016 and 2017, but actual money released was N173 billion and N1.43 trillion.\n\nIn 2018, the government budgeted N2.8 trillion but actual money released was N1.6 trillion, while in 2019 the government budgeted N2 trillion for capital expenditure but actual money released was N1.17 trillion as of Q3\u2019 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the government budgeted N2.4 trillion but actual money released was N1.74 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, the government\u2019s capital expenditure, including that of 10 Government-Owned Enterprises (GOEs) and projects tied to loans, was put at N3.85 trillion.\n\nAccording to the public presentation of 2022 FGN Approved Budget, \u201cAs at November 2021, N3.40 trillion had been expended for capital. Of this, N2.98 trillion represents 83 percent of the provision for MDAs\u2019 capital, N369.9 billion for Multi-lateral / Bilateral Project-tied loans, and N49.52 billion as GOEs capital expenditure.\u201d\n\nLast year, the government broke ground on a $2 billion internationally-funded rail line connecting the country\u2019s north to neighbouring Niger Republic, and announced it was forming an Infraco, a public-private infrastructure fund with N1 trillion ($2.6bn) in seed capital from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and the Africa Finance Corporation, a mostly privately owned pan-African project finance firm.\n\nSome critics argue that a rail connection to Niger, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries with a gross domestic product of about one-fortieth the size of Nigeria\u2019s, is a poor use of scarce resources.",
          "summary": "In his Channels TV interview Wednesday, President Buhari failed to engage questions about Nigeria\u2019s woeful economic indicators, but rather insisted that to fix the economy Nigerians must return to the farm.\nDespite the rhetoric about investment in the agriculture and bolder commitment to infrastructure the sector has grown at the weakest rate under the Buhari administration since the return of democracy in 1999, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Statisense, a data consulting firm.\nThe sector grew at an average of 10.48 percent between 2016 and 2020, the lowest since 1999.\nIn 2018, the government budgeted N2.8 trillion but actual money released was N1.6 trillion, while in 2019 the government budgeted N2 trillion for capital expenditure but actual money released was N1.17 trillion as of Q3\u2019 2019.\nIn 2020, the government budgeted N2.4 trillion but actual money released was N1.74 trillion.",

My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

          "title": "Carbonated drinks tax will be harmful to economy \u2013 MAN warns",
          "text": "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), has warned that the recently announced excise duty on non-alcoholic beverages will cause a 0.43% contraction in output and about 40% drop on total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nDirector-General, MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, said this in Lagos, while reacting to the introduction of N10 excise duty on carbonated drinks as announced by the Federal Government on Wednesday, NAN reported.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, at the public breakdown of the 2022 Budget, said the government has introduced N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nAccording to her, the tax will discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages with its attendant health implications, while also raising revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures in line with the 2022 Budget priorities.\n\nHowever, reacting to the minister\u2019s announcement, Ajayi-kadir argued that food and beverages contributed the highest at 38% of the total manufacturing sector quota to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and comprised 22.5% of jobs and generated more than 1.5million jobs.\n\n\u201cOne is particularly worried about the ripple effect on the introduction of the excise, despite strenuous evidence-based advice to the contrary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis will have an unpleasant impact on employment, households and consumers. As seen from previous impact analysis, excise affects production outputs, revenues and profits.\n\n\u201cThis causes companies to pursue cost-cutting measures to reduce the effect of diminishing revenue and profits by reducing employee salaries or retrenchment. So, this excise would certainly cast a sunset to this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, introducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\n\nAjayi-kadir insisted that the government\u2019s revenue aspirations in introducing this excise may not be justified in the long run.\n\nAccording to him, the excise estimated to generate N81 billion between 2022 and 2025 would not be sufficient to compensate the corresponding government\u2019s revenue losses in other taxes from the sector.\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor instance, the corresponding effect of reduced industry revenue on government revenues is estimated to be up to N142 billion contractions in Value Added Tax (VAT) raised by the sector and N54 billion Corporate Income Tax reduction between 2022 and 2025.\n\n\u201cThis is not to mention the potential negative impact on manufacturers/supply chain.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the 6th highest consumer of soft drink, but per capita consumption is low. Introducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\n\n\u201cA decrease in production levels or ability to purchase raw materials as a result of the introduction of excise tax will result in reduced profits for the supply chain players in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\n\n\u201cWhat is not realized by many is that excise begets high production costs, which in turn adversely affect production level, and ultimately results in dwindling profits.\n\n\u201cThis will grossly impact the small and emerging business owners in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\u201d",

          "title": "FirstBank\u2019s focus on putting customers first continues to be a driving force \u2013 Adeduntan",
          "text": "Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, MD and CEO of First Bank Nigeria Limited, has said year 2021 saw his tenure extended as part of efforts to ensure the stability of the financial institution.\n\nThe First Bank boss who spoke in this interview with THISDAY, also about the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the future of the bank, trends that shaped the economy in 2021, his expectations for 2022 and other pertinent banking sector issues.\n\nExcerpts below:\n\nWhat is the level of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s involvement in First Bank?\n\nThe central bank\u2019s involvement in FirstBank is essentially about playing the role of the regulator. CBN\u2019s intervention has been in the best interest of the bank\u2019s stakeholders and its performance; aimed at restoring confidence in the bank as well as to reassure the depositors, creditors and other stakeholders of the bank of its commitment to ensuring the stability of the financial system.\n\nYour third quarter results saw a decline in some of the key indicators such as gross earnings, profit before tax and profit after tax, what was responsible for this?\n\nThe Commercial Banking reported a resilient performance resulting in a Profit before Tax of N44.3billion for the nine months period ended September 30, 2021. This result was delivered in a sustained low yield environment, which continues to compress margins as the macro-economic environment remained challenging amidst the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s focus on putting the customers first continues to be a driving force as we keep supporting our customers in meeting their business needs. The evidence of this support is reflected in the 24.1% y-t-d growth in the loan book, underpinned by solid risk management practices and from which sustainable good quality earnings are being delivered as asset quality remains firmly under control. Furthermore, in our concerted efforts at sustaining our dominance in financial inclusion and digital banking, we continue to record growths in our agent banking business, supporting the 17.5 per cent growth in non-interest income.\n\nWe remain determined to continue strengthening our capabilities across our footprints, as we are confident that our investment in technology and the strong balance sheet, which the Group has built over the last six years, will provide the solid platform for more impressive results into the future.\n\nThe CBN recently introduced the eNaira, what has been the acceptance rate by FirstBank\u2019s customers, and do you think this will positively impact your bank?\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as the regulator of the banking industry continues to lead and drive development in the industry. In the banking industry, digital currency is the future and the CBN is staying ahead of the curve in Africa with the introduction of the eNaira given the several benefits associated with the digital currency, such as safety, speed, and convenience. A review of the events over the course of the past few years has shown that digitalisation in its different forms has been net positive for the financial services industry.\n\nThe eNaira is no different; the digitalisation of the naira expands upon Nigeria\u2019s already advanced payment ecosystem; the roadmap for the eNaira over the next couple of months will reveal some exciting use cases that will further grow the ecosystem and encourage even more interaction with this new form of currency. Currently we have a whole segment of digitally curious customers who have started interacting with the eNaira, and as the eNaira ecosystem grows and acceptance increases as a store and exchange of value, so will those numbers.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s channels currently account for about 17 per cent of the total reported eNaira transaction volume. The bank is dependably dynamic and continues to be at the vanguard of innovation in the banking industry. Overall, I am confident that the eNaira will positively impact the bank as our customers continue to transact through the bank\u2019s channels, supporting the digital economy drive. The number of customers will increase as the eNaira will enable the sign-on of excluded people in the financial system, thereby supporting the financial inclusion drive of the CBN. The eNaira will reduce the cost of processing cash for the bank, thereby making it a cheaper, reliable and faster way of exchange and the bank will have access to customers across the continents, simplifying and facilitating cross border payments and trade.\n\nWhat\u2019s opinion about the CBN\u2019s FX and what long-term impacts will it have on the exchange rate and has your bank been able to meet the demands of customer?\n\nThe main objectives of exchange rate policy in Nigeria are to preserve the value of the domestic currency, maintain a favorable external reserves position and ensure external balance without compromising the need for internal balance and the overall goal of macroeconomic stability. The new CBN\u2019s foreign exchange (FX) policy is geared towards harmonising the FX rates across the various markets and increasing the availability of FX to those who genuinely need it and not for those who are speculators or those who deliberately try to distort the market. The current FX policy of the CBN has recorded some successes in improving the availability of FX for transactions and curbing the incessant decline of the naira exchange rate in the parallel markets.\n\nThe current policy is expected to strengthen the naira exchange rate, however, there are several other factors that are critical to the movement of the exchange rate, predominantly oil prices and capital inflows. If these factors continue to trend positively, then we can expect a relative stability of naira relative to other international currencies. I believe the long-term impact will be the relative stability of the naira, as the CBN continues to meet all legitimate needs, increasing the confidence of the people and sending the right signaling effect to foreign investors. Typically, FirstBank engages the regulators, providing all the necessary foreign exchange bid documentations and following defined processes to ensure that our customers\u2019 bids are successful, and we get as much allocation as possible for all our needy customers.\n\nHow prepared do you think banks are for Basel III?\n\nThe Basel III accord was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and is built upon the frameworks of the existing Basel II accord, with the aim of strengthening regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking industry, globally. Due to the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on banks, it became imperative for the current frameworks under Basel II to be revised to improve the ability of banks to handle shocks from financial stress and to strengthen their transparency and disclosure. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on September 2, 2021, issued a circular to all banks in Nigeria titled Basel III Implementation by all Deposit Money Banks. The circular aims to inform all banks of the issuance of guidelines for the implementation of the Basel III standard which is a voluntary global regulatory framework that addresses banks\u2019 capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk.\n\nBasel III standard will prevent banks from taking excessive risks that can negatively impact the players and the economy. Implementation of Basel III will have significant implications for capital requirement \u2013 there will be a higher minimum CAR requirement for players in the industry. However, the apex bank has engaged and defined a road map to ensure that operators in the banking industry meet and surpass the higher capital requirements. The Basel III will be implemented in phases and banks have developed their capital plan to ensure they meet and surpass the higher capital and liquidity requirements for the Basel III implementation. Many banks have revamped their operational and credit risk infrastructure to mitigate operational and credit risk losses. The effect is already being seen in the general decline in the industry\u2019s non-performing loan portfolio. The successful implementation of the Basel III frameworks would be beneficial to the banking industry and the economy at large.\n\nDo you think it would spur more mergers and acquisitions in year 2022?\n\nThe Basel III standard implementation by the Central Bank of Nigeria is aimed at decreasing the risk of the financial services sector. The main aim of Basel III is to improve financial stability \u2013 the standard is set to increase the soundness of Nigeria\u2019s financial services sector and the confidence of the people in the financial system. The implementation is expected to impact banks\u2019 capital adequacy by raising liquidity and lowering bank leverage. Analysts believe that the implementation of Basel III would increase the capital requirement of Systemic Important Banks (SIB) in Nigeria to 17 per cent from 15 per cent but, most banks in Nigeria are well-capitalised and are expected to increase capital buffer that can be drawn upon in periods of stress. However, despite being well-capitalised, the implementation of Basel III would reduce the capital headroom of operators and banks would have to resort to various strategies to strengthen their capital positions to drive credit and business growth. These strategies may include mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as Basel III policy implementation takes effect to strengthen their capital positions as the policy requires higher capital requirements/enhanced capital cushions. Nonetheless, I believe Nigerian banks are well-positioned to withstand regulatory headwinds whilst driving growth.\n\nHow would you assess your bank\u2019s performance through the pandemic?\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic disrupted several sectors of the economy, the banking industry was one of the most impacted given the critical role that banks play in the economy and across all sectors. However, FirstBank navigated the pandemic crisis successfully and recorded the best financial performance since 2015 in the 2020 financial year. FirstBank delivered a strong performance both on the financial and non-financial front underpinned by resiliency, digital innovation and customer centricity. On financial performance, despite the pandemic, the bank recorded significant growth in its revenue base, profitability and asset. Revenue and Profitability Performance: In the context of the pandemic, FirstBank Group delivered strong financial results, generating gross revenue of N539 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group\u2019s non-interest income grew impressively by 24 per cent between 2019 and 2020, closing at N154.5 billion for the year ending 31 December 2020.\n\nThe non-interest income growth was propelled by transactional and eBusiness income and credit related fees. In 2020, FirstBank Group delivered its most profitable year since 2015. The Group\u2019s profit before tax increased from N70.8 billion for the year ended 31 December 2019 to N73.6 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020, resulting in a year-on-year profitability growth of 4 percent between 2019 and 2020. Strong Asset Growth and Stable Funding Base: FirstBank Group experienced solid total asset growth of 25.5 per cent to N7.4 trillion as at December 31st, 2020 (2019: N5.9 trillion). The Group continues to maintain a strong liquidity and capital position driven by its high volume of customer deposits held in low-cost current and savings accounts, which amounted to over 75 percent of the Bank\u2019s customer deposit base as at 31 December 2020.\n\nRenewed emphasis by the Group in improving the service performance level in the retail segment, expanding digital touchpoints and repurposing of its branch network have resulted in 20.5 per cent increase in deposits to N4.7 trillion as at December 31st, 2020 (2019: N3.9 trillion); a reflection of our strong franchise value which has come to be associated with safety, stability and innovation. Through the bank\u2019s extensive physical footprint and expanding agent banking network and digital banking capabilities, the Group continues to reach an increasing number of customers, which drives customer deposits in low-cost current and savings accounts that serve as an important funding base. On non-financial performance, the bank\u2019s non-financial performance across disruptive innovation and customer focus lens has been impressive. Some of the milestones achieved during the pandemic was us launching the pioneer FastTrack ATM in Africa offering customers a touchless solution for ATM transactions and enabling customers to pre-order cash on ATMs via the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking platforms.\n\nWe unveiled FirstBank\u2019s Virtual Payment Card, a digital representation of the naira-denominated plastic debit card, launched the Firstmonie Agent Credit, a digital lending solution designed to provide bridge finance to help our Agents solve liquidity challenges, leveraged technology to promote digital account opening process through the Digital Sales Executive App, ATMs, Firstmonie Agents, *894# USSD banking, FirstMobile and Company website. Also, we upgraded the Bank\u2019s mobile banking application, FirstMobile, with new and improved features to promote a convenient and secured mobile banking experience for customers, rolled out FirstBank Digital Innovation Lab\u2019s proprietary developed Mobile Banking App for our wholly owned subsidiary FBNBank Senegal, Increased customer account base (including wallets) to over 30 million.\n\nMaintained the dominant digital bank rating in Nigeria with over 20 per cent market share of electronic banking transaction volumes, about 16 million users on our digital banking platforms (USSD *894#, FirstMobile and FirstOnline) and over 11 million card users. Expanded the Agent Banking network to over 86,500[1] agents across 772 out of 774 local governments in Nigeria and paid out over N18 billion as commissions to Firstmonie Agents.Reinforced the Bank\u2019s financial inclusion drive with the disbursement of over N22 billion and N35 billion in loans through FirstAdvance and Agent Credit digital platforms, respectively. Provided free e-learning solutions in partnership with Roducate, IBM and the Lagos State Government, thereby helping to reduce the negative impact of school closure following the COVID-19 pandemic on students in Lagos State. Additionally, the bank, in partnership with Junior Achievement, positively impacted over one million students through its financial literacy, entrepreneurship and career counselling programs and Improved customer ranking in the Wholesale Banking segment by four places in 2020.\n\nWhat are your expectations and forecast for the economy in 2022?\n\nGlobally and in Nigeria, economic recovery was strong in 2021 following improved vaccination exercise, and support from monetary and fiscal authorities for demand. However, I believe 2022 will witness slower pace in economic growth over lingering health crisis (the fourth wave of the covid-19 pandemic with the omicron variant) and rising price levels globally. Also, the boost from base effects and reopening of the economy will decline in 2022. Locally I expect economic growth to improve slightly; however, the following trends are expected in 2022 are disinflationary trend to continue in 2022 but inflation would still bite harder although potential PMS subsidy removal is the most consequential known factor that could push inflation to its worst-case estimates in 2022. Higher taxes may take the center stage as the federal government explores all options to cover for burgeoning budget deficit. Potential improvement in fiscal metrics given the bullish sentiment in the international oil market and savings potential from the PMS subsidy removal.\n\nCapital importation may improve as foreign portfolio investments, diaspora remittances and other sources of inflow witness gradual growth following global economic recovery and increased employment for Nigerians in diaspora. Monetary policy measures may normalise in 2022 with the Central Bank of Nigeria maintaining an accommodative stand. Economic growth in 2022 is projected to be with the range of 2.7 per cent and three per cent. However, the key activities to look out for in 2022 include electioneering, the penultimate year before the next general elections, increase in taxes, buoyant oil market, PMS subsidy removal, and exchange rate policy of the CBN.\n\nWith the recent push to increase lending by CBN, don\u2019t you think this would impact or drive up your bank\u2019s NPLs?\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria had in recent times taken some tough decisions to address the challenges affecting the growth of the real sector and the Nigerian economy. This includes ensuring that banks comply with the minimum 65 per cent loan to deposit ratio (LDR). This increased lending by CBN has proved potent in filling the financing gap as credit to private sector has indeed risen to an appreciable level. Although there is a concern that this push to increase lending by CBN would drive up bank\u2019s non-performing loans (NPLs), a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) noted that despite the increase in LDR there is an inverse proportionate reduction in non-performing loans. FirstBank has achieved great strides in reducing its NPL from double-digit in 2016 to single digit in 2021 which attest to the fact that the bank is strong and resilient.\n\nI am happy to note that the recent drive to increase lending will not affect the bank\u2019s NPLs negatively as the bank has instituted a robust and automated operational and credit risk management processes and infrastructure. FirstBank has in the recent years built an enduring risk culture and governance system, strengthened the risk infrastructure through specialised training, digitalisation credit processes and imbibe disciplined and active portfolio management approach thereby ensuring strict regulatory compliance. FirstBank will continue to support CBN\u2019s lending initiative to achieving strong economic growth and diversification as the bank is well positioned to maintain good asset quality and profitable credit portfolio.\n\nWith the emergence of PSBs and telcos granted licences, how much would that deepen financial inclusion and do you see this competing with banks\u2019 agency banking?\n\nThe introduction of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) is another step taken by the CBN in line with its goal of promoting financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services for the unbanked, underbanked, and underserved segments of the population across all parts of the country. The entrance of the PSBs will certainly deepen financial inclusion. It will impact the financial services landscape to the extent that the Telcos will be able to leverage their extensive infrastructure to offer last mile delivery of financial solutions to those currently unbanked. Today, we have 70 million Nigerians that have been issued the National Identity Number.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of this number are currently unbanked, and they can more easily be reached. The expected impact will ride on the back of synergy and collaborations across the industry. And this is what we are already seeing. For us at FirstBank, the development is not a threat, we see it more as an opportunity. You will agree that for an institution like ours that has been around and flourishing for over 127 years, our ability to read and effectively respond to market trends has been well proven. What we have done with our agent banking is to build a platform that could be leveraged to enrich customer offerings in diverse ways. We do not just possess spread, we possess depth. So, leveraging technology and open API, we are poised to work with the PSBs to deliver value to the banking public and citizenry.\n\nStill on agency banking, can you give us an update on the expansion of your bank\u2019s agency banking and the impact it had especially during the lockdown?\n\nFirstBank\u2019s agent banking, Firstmonie, has witnessed continuous growth since its launch. The Firstmonie agent network operates in 772 of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria and is the largest bank-led network in Nigeria, and indeed Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 150,000 agents including over 22,000 women agents, enabling the Bank to drive gender inclusive growth within rural communities. The Firstmonie network has processed over N17 trillion ($39.3 billion) in over 817 million transactions between 2018 and December 2021. The Firstmonie initiative has been a very formidable vehicle for job creation and economic development in several communities across the country, as over 150,000 direct jobs and 450,000 indirect jobs have been created, with an agent earning an average monthly commission/income of N85,000. Over 1.5 million individuals have been economically impacted through the jobs created via the FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie agent banking proposition. Significant percentage of Firstmonie\u2019s agents are in the rural areas, contributing significantly to the development of the rural economy in Nigeria.\n\nOverall, FirstBank is supporting the social-economic development of Nigeria in a profitable way. During the peak of the lockdown, the Firstmonie network provided an alternative channel for the Bank\u2019s customers to conduct transactions and meet their basic financial service needs, serving as quasi-physical touchpoint for the bank\u2019s customers. This resulted in the Firstmonie network processing over N6.6 trillion worth of transactions during the period We are not resting on our oars and the growth in 2021 is equally impressive; as at Q3 2021, we had processed more value of transactions than we did in the whole of 2020. The outlook for 2022 and beyond is also quite exciting. We will continue to focus on impacting the lives of the communities we serve and deepening the services we offer through collaborations with partners, the regulatory authorities, other industry players, and our customers.\n\nYour tenure as CEO was last year renewed, can you speak on your achievements and milestones thus far?\n\nI was appointed Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of this iconic institution \u2013 FirstBank of Nigeria Limited in January 2016. The board and management team embarked on a transformation journey with deliberate and focused extraordinary actions to rescue and gradually rebuild the bank. Fast forward, the rebuild effort of the last five-plus years has translated to significant outcomes across key indicators of business momentum and growth. Some of the achievements and milestones include: Grew the bank\u2019s average assets to N8.2 trillion as at Q3, 2021 from N3.9 trillion as at December 2015, increased Group deposits base to N5.1 trillion in Q3, 2021 from N2.9 trillion as at December 2015.\n\nFirstBank grew the Bank\u2019s profit before tax to N52.7 billion in Q3, 2021 from N10.2 billion as at December 2015, reduced the Bank\u2019s NPL ratio from double-digit in 2016 to single digit in 2021 (vintage NPL is <1%). Reduced cost of risk to <2% as at Q3 2021 from double digit in 2016, transformed and repositioned international subsidiaries businesses for improved performance \u2013 all are returning positive profitability, upgraded the core banking platform (Finacle Future Ready \u2013 FFR) with improved processing capacity and availability + better integration agility. Built an industry leading digital banking (electronic banking) business. Made significant progress in transaction banking \u2013 controlling 26 per cent of industry corporate e-bills payment market share. Also, during my tenure, the FastTrack ATM was Launched in Africa offering customers a touchless solution for ATM transactions and enabling customers to pre-order cash on ATMs via the Bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking platforms.Unveiled the FirstBank Virtual Payment Card, a digital representation of the naira-denominated plastic debit card. Launched the Firstmonie Agent Credit, a digital lending solution designed to provide bridge finance to help our Agents solve liquidity challenges.\n\nLeveraged technology to promote digital account opening process through the ATMs, Firstmonie Agents, *894# USSD banking, FirstMobile and Company website. Upgraded the Bank\u2019s mobile banking application, FirstMobile, with new and improved features to promote a convenient and secured mobile banking experience for customers. Rolled out FirstBank Digital Innovation Lab\u2019s proprietary developed Mobile Banking App LitApp. Others are increased customer account base (including wallets) to over 34 million.

We are grateful for accolades and achievements which attest to our exceptional commitment to promoting national, regional and global economic growth and development through constructive engagements with the public and private sectors of various economies, and our host communities across the globe.\n\nWhat should your customers and shareholders expect from your bank in the near future?\n\nThe industry has changed and will continue to evolve at a faster pace with new innovative technologies, and the customers will continue to gravitate towards institutions that provide the best digital payments services that address their changing needs for convenience, speed and security.\n\nFirstBank will remain at the cutting edge of innovation and technology in the industry. FirstBank has the right capabilities and competencies to lead and take advantage of the new developments in the digital payment space, and indeed, the banking industry. At FirstBank, we will continue focus on customer-led innovation as we put our customers first in everything we do.\n\nWe understand that although the needs of customers may remain the same, the channel of delivery remains dynamic, and we must stay ahead of the curve; Our stakeholders should expect to see a bank that is future-proof and ready to provide best-in-class products and services that will meet and surpass their needs.\n\nFirstBank remains dependably dynamic and will ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are met to the customers, we will provide the best products and deliver exceptional customer experience, to the shareholders, capital appreciation and good dividend payout,to employees, competitive emolument and good career path, to regulators, voluntary compliance to all rules and regulations and to communities, we will be good corporate citizens and give back to the society where we operate.\n\nTell us about some of the impact of FirstBank on the communities where it operates?\n\nAt FirstBank, we are committed to nation-building and have been driving sustainable social, economic and environmental growth for over 127 years of our existence. Our community development initiatives are anchored on our strategic Education, Health and Welfare pillars. Our engagement in sustainable business practices is based on our promise of enhancing economic development and ensuring economic stability for the present and future generation. Our key programmes include Infrastructure Development programme; Endowment programme; Future First (Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Career Counseling); E-Learning Initiative; SPARK (Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness) and CRS Week. I will highlight achievements for a few. First Bank Infrastructural Development programme is aimed at promoting infrastructure development under its identified areas of support.\n\nThis includes providing infrastructure facilities in schools, hospitals and environmental infrastructure projects. This is in recognition of the importance of these facilities in improving the quality of life. We have built over 16 infrastructure projects which include universities and secondary and primary schools and recently commissioned a Primary Health Centre in Ijedodo Community in partnership with Lagos State Government. The FutureFirst programme in partnership with Junior Achievement Nigeria has impacted Over 1,000,000 people across the regions of the country including Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja with knowledge of financial literacy and entrepreneurship.\n\nOver 170,000 students have benefitted from the E-learning initiative thus far. This include 20,000 indigent students that have received free low-end devices preloaded with accredited content.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Week (CR&S) Week which started in 2017 is a dedicated week designed to offer opportunities for employees to give their time and resources to defined causes in line with the Bank\u2019s CR&S strategic approach. The Week\u2019s activities are an aspect of the Bank\u2019s Employee Giving & Volunteering Programme, which was instituted with the aim of encouraging employees to give back to the community as well as inculcate in them the integral corporate culture of giving. The main initiative implemented during this week is SPARK.\n\nSPARK is a values-based initiative designed to raise consciousness that we can choose to be kind. SPARK which was introduced in the maiden edition of the Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability (CR&S) week in 2017 espouses reigniting our values which appear to be eroding fast. The initiative focuses on creating and reinforcing an attitude of going beyond just meeting the material needs of people who are unable to help themselves to showing compassion, empathy, affection.\n\nIn 2021, the lives impacted include 60 Beneficiary schools; over 18,000 secondary students\u2019 participants in SPARK launch; 20,000 underprivileged including widows lives touched in 8 countries including United Kingdom, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Sierra Lone, Senegal & Nigeria. We had partnerships with over 100 Charities / NGOs including LEAP Africa; International Women Society; UNGC; UN Women; Junior Achievement Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, SPARK Amplification has expanded and deepened staff involvement within our various host communities by integrating and institutionalizing acts of random kindness, which has seen 7 Directorates & Departments in the Bank implement various initiatives including empowering small businesses; infrastructure and books for schools, and providing household items for orphanages. In 2021, staff contributions spent to implement SPARK amplification stands at N13,570,743.10 and a total of 9,706.5 volunteering hours.\n\nWhen will the Elephant (FirstBank) stand \u2018Gidigba\u2019 again?\n\nAs I said earlier, the bank is consistently delivering a resilient performance within a challenging macro-economic environment amidst the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. I highlighted some key points as evidence in our commitment to and journey towards reclaiming our top position in the industry. These include firstly, our determined efforts at sustaining our dominance in financial inclusion and digital banking, reflecting growth in our agent banking business, supporting the 17.5 per cent growth in non-interest income. The second thing is our deliberate, planned and consistent efforts in putting the customer first as shown in the 24.1% y-t-d growth in the loan book, fortified by solid risk management practices and from which sustainable good quality earnings are being delivered as asset quality remains firmly under control.\n\nAnd the confidence that our stakeholders including our customers repose in us is reflective in 10.3% y-t-d growth customers\u2019 deposits. This is in addition to our constant investment in technology. We have always maintained that FirstBank is built to be resilient, stable and for the long-haul. And we remain committed to reinforcing our performance by the continued implementation of the Bank\u2019s strategy, which is designed to deliver accelerated growth in profitability and overcome the possible challenges of the environment.\n\nFirst published on THISDAY",
          "summary": "FirstBank\u2019s focus on putting the customers first continues to be a driving force as we keep supporting our customers in meeting their business needs.\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as the regulator of the banking industry continues to lead and drive development in the industry.\nDuring the peak of the lockdown, the Firstmonie network provided an alternative channel for the Bank\u2019s customers to conduct transactions and meet their basic financial service needs, serving as quasi-physical touchpoint for the bank\u2019s customers.\nBuilt an industry leading digital banking (electronic banking) business.\nAnd the confidence that our stakeholders including our customers repose in us is reflective in 10.3% y-t-d growth customers\u2019 deposits.",

          "text": "The Southeast zonal and state executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), including political leaders and elders from the zone, have endorsed the presidential aspiration of former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nThe endorsement was done during consultative session hosted by Anyim on Thursday in Enugu.\n\nThe leaders from five states of the Southeast, including Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo states, said they were endorsing Anyim after taking \u201cdue cognizance of his precious record of distinguished and unblemished service as President of the Senate and Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe PDP zonal leaders and elders said in all his positions, Anyim has distinguished himself as a detribalized statesman, consensus builder and true nationalist.\n\nIn a ten-point resolution issued at the end of the meeting, and signed by Senator Theodore Orji, former governor of Abia State, who also chaired the session and Chief Duru-Iheoma, SAN, former chairman of PDP in Imo State, the Southeast PDP stakeholders reiterated that the people of the geo-political zone \u201chave earned the right to occupy the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 on account of their eminent qualifications and overwhelming contributions to the development of all parts of the federation through the years.\n\nThey said because of that, \u201cthe choice of a South East citizen as presidential candidate of the party in 2023 will guarantee to every Nigerian a sense of equity, justice and inclusion in the management of the affairs of the nation. In our view, this is the best way of ensuring that we build a nation that leaves no one or group behind.\u201d\n\nThe resolution further said, \u201cOn account of the foregoing, we congratulate Senator Anyim Pius Anyim for the patriotism of his decision to offer himself for national service by aspiring to contest in the 2023 Presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe take due cognizance of his precious record of distinguished and unblemished service as President of the Senate and Secretary to the Government of the Federation. In these positions, he distinguished himself as a detribalized statesman, consensus builder and true nationalist.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, unanimously endorse his aspiration with all conviction and enthusiasm and eagerly commend him to the rest of the nation as a worthy leader who will pilot the affairs of the nation towards greater security, unity and prosperity for all citizens.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of the foregoing, we hereby oblige Senator Anyim his request that we all join him to persuade and reassure every part of the country to do justice to the South East and thereby promote equity and justice as core values of our nation.\n\n\u201cIn assuring Senator Anyim of our support for his aspiration, we wish to also extend the same hand of support and solidarity to all qualified and deserving sons and daughters of our zone with similar aspiration and who reach out to us as Senator Anyim has done.\n\n\u201cIt is our solemn appeal to all the peoples of the South East zone to remain steadfast in the hope that we can all join hands in solidarity with all other parts of the federation to build a prosperous nation founded on democracy, equity and inclusion to the benefit of this great nation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during the meeting, Anyim said he is stepping out with a sense of humility, as a Nigerian with patriotic fervour, considerable knowledge of Nigeria, its diversities and current challenges; and so properly equipped with clarity of the needed solutions.\n\n\u201cLet me elaborate; as a young officer, at the then Directorate of Social Mobilization, I understood the need for value orientation as a tool for instilling patriotism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was also schooled to appreciate the value of social justice, equity and fairness as building blocks for social harmony and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAs a young politician I imbibed the founding vision of the PDP as a grassroot movement that would provide leadership that will respect the rule of law, ensure that power belongs to the people and deliver national cohesion and inclusiveness through good governance.\n\n\u201cI have been privileged to understand our national problems and appreciate their enormity and peculiarities in the last 21 years from my vantage positions in both the legislative and the executive arms of government.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I have a clear view of the task ahead as well as the solutions needed to advance the cause of our country.\n\n\u201cMy records as President of the Senate and as Secretary to the Government of the Federation clearly show that I am more interested in building strong institutions than seeking enhancement of personal power or position.\n\n\u201cMy records show effective and efficient management of the nation\u2019s diversity on the basis of equity, justice, fairness and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cI am a committed believer in the rule of law; and will always promote and protect the sanctity of lives as well as the rights and liberties of all citizens.\n\n\u201cMy decision is a product of some years of prayers, reflections and introspection on not just my capacity and preparedness to take on the task ahead, but also deep thoughts on our national challenges and the solutions they demand.\u201d\n\nAnyim who reiterated his earlier position that he will contest whether the presidency is zoned to the South or not, however said if the presidency is zoned to South East, it will satisfy the just demand of equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cIf it is not zoned to the South East, it will remain a burden on the conscience of the nation.\n\n\u201cLet me therefore at this point join all wellmeaning Nigerians to appeal to all the political parties to take the fair, just and equitable decision to zone their presidential slots to the South particularly the South East.\u201d\n\nPresent at the meeting were all the zonal and state executives of the PDP, Senator T.A. Orji; Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Dr. Ali Odefa, PDP National Vice Chairman, Southeast; Iyom Josephine Anenih, Senator Obinna Ogba; Dr. Frank Nweke; Prof. Elochukwu Amucheazi; Nze Ozichukwu Chukwu; Senator Emma Nwaka; Senator Chuka Utazi, among others.",

It can be any other person tomorrow, hence the need to join in the crusade to stamp out cruelty, barbarism and violence from our school system.\u201d\n\nThe activist, who is also the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, wondered why the Presidency as well as the National Assembly have been silent on a case of apparent murder of a young boy now being swept under the carpet.\n\nHe wondered if the Federal Government would have been silent on the matter had the victim been the son of a highly placed government official.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe cannot all close our eyes to this apparent coverup in the investigation and exoneration of suspects named in the death of Oromoni Jr.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe least we all expected of the Lagos State Government was to ensure a thorough and unbiased investigation of the incident, and prosecute those responsible, if any.\n\n\u201cToday, Oromoni Jr\u2019s death has been added to the growing number of mysterious deaths. What a shame!\u201d\n\nHe called on the Senate and House of Representatives to cause a public hearing on the matter where the suspects and parents of the deceased would defend themselves before Nigerians.\n\nHe insisted that the death of Oromoni Jr would hunt the perpetrators and their collaborators for life should justice be compromised in this manner.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal and Lagos State governments fail to ensure justice in this case, Oromoni Jr ans his family will surely get justice from God as the prayers of the family will be answered one day,\u201d he said.\n\nHe condoled with the parents and family of the deceased and urged them to fight on till the true circumstances surrounding the death of their son is unraveled and justice served.",

Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week.\n\n\u201dSo, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari revealed how COVID-19 has been a relief for him, on his schedule as fewer people are now lining up to see him.\n\n\u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time and about my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, he reiterated the commitment of his administration to address the nation\u2019s security challenges before he leaves office in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, the security forces are working hard to address all the nation\u2019s security problems, adding that more equipment and ammunition are being procured by the government to make the battle against criminals much easier across the country.\n\nBuhari said that he had done his best for Nigeria and he would continue to do so for the general progress of the nation.\n\n\u201dYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as President. So, I have gone through the system and really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation.\n\n\u201dBut what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the southeast now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing.\n\n\u201dWe closed the border with Benin, we closed the border with Niger. But we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armories, police stations have been attacked and so on.\n\n\u201dSo, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said joining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by corrupt politicians would not save them against prosecution by anti-graft agencies.\n\nThe president said this in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) monitored in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people really to even be corrupt.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the defectors would not be allowed to go scot-free, the president said: \u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused.\n\n\u201cBut luckily I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels. Behave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarrelling and a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nUrges democracy in APC\n\nOn his party, he said there was need to follow democratic process in selecting the person who would succeed him, stressing that he is not a kingmaker who would determine the next president.\n\nHe said any governor that tries to impose a candidate on the people in the forthcoming elections would face problems.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituents, they will know their positions, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after Abuja. So those who want to be elected at any level let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nParty wrangling\n\nCommenting on the forthcoming APC national convention and the internal wrangling within the party, he said there was the need to address all issues to be able to retain power.\n\n\u201cWe have time frame; we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off, they are still are still off, they can see it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also said he does not expect Nigerians to appreciate him when he leaves office, saying he has done his best.\n\n\u201cYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as president. So, I have gone through the system. And really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the South-east now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing? We closed the border with Benin; we closed the border with Niger.\n\n\u201cBut we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armouries; police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also expressed optimism that the insecurity in the country can be resolved before he leaves office, stressing that security forces were working hard on it just as more equipment and ammunition were being procured.\n\n\u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it because members of the security, the armed forces and others, they are all security, it depends on one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo no matter, when people are selfish, is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the North-east and South-south and how much progress we have made and acquiring some helicopters, aircraft, their maintenance, their ammunition, armoured cars, you know to counter effectively, the bandits, they cost money and they cost time for training and adaptation,\u201d he said.\n\nLong hours tiring\n\nThe president also admitted that the current long hours he spends working is telling on him because of his age, saying he looks forward to the end of his tenure in 17 months to join his colleagues in retirement.\n\nAsked how he felt clocking 79 recently, the President said: \u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see you, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time.\n\n\u201cAnd about my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day flight in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered, virtually every week, so, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d",
          "summary": "\ufeffPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said joining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by corrupt politicians would not save them against prosecution by anti-graft agencies.\nThe president said this in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) monitored in Abuja.\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability.\nSo, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituents, they will know their positions, coming up.\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day flight in the office is no joke.",

          "text": "The federal government Thursday said it has no plan to disengage civil servants because of the nation\u2019s economic downturn.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed stated this while featuring on the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA)\u2019s \u2018Good Morning Nigeria\u2019 programme monitored by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nThe minister said President Muhammadu Buhari has always remained an advocate of workers\u2019 welfare and would never mandate a mass disengagement of the nation\u2019s public workforce.\n\nShe, however, said the government would reduce overheads by ensuring merger of its agencies.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came against the backdrop of media reports (not in Blueprint) that government was planning to sack workers over cash crunch.\n\nDebunking the reports, the minister said: \u201cMr President doesn\u2019t want to disengage staff. That is what he has directed from the beginning of his administration. He also directed that we pay salaries. The federal government has never failed in paying salaries and he said we must always pay pensions.\n\n\u201cSo, he has been consistent in those directives and we have followed those directives to the letter.\u201d\n\nHinting on plans to cut down on expenditures in various agencies and ministries, she said this remained the only way to ensure reduced cost of governance.\n\n\u201cWell, we do hope that at the end of the exercise, some agencies will be merged and it will cut down operational costs.\n\n\u201cAnd also we will be able to come up with incentive packages to retrain people and redeploy them in some areas where they are useful. For example, we still have a very high need for teachers so we can retrain people and send them to teach but also incentive packages to exit. Again, that is also money. If you want people to exit you have to pay them.\n\n\u201cThat is an incentive package so that they can go. That is why it is taking a lot of time because it is not easy to decide on this. Everything centres on resources.\n\n\u201cWe need resources and if we had a lot of money, we would just give very beautiful incentive packages and people would exit and go and start their businesses and we would reduce the size of the personnel cost,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nFG\u2019s N10bn to Nigerians\n\nIn a related development, the federal government said it pays two million households N5, 000 monthly, the cost of which comes to N10 billion.\n\nSimilarly, the government said over 10 million Nigerian pupils benefit from its school feeding programme since the government\u2019s initiative commenced.\n\nNational Coordinator National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) Dr Umar Bindr said this at the NSIP annual strategic review meeting Thursday in Abuja.\n\nBindir said the households were captured under its Conditional Cash Transfer programme.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have more than 10 million applicants nationwide. We have successfully managed to onboard two million, and we are consistently paying these households N5, 000 per month. The households have an average number of five to seven people.\n\n\u201cWe are feeding an average of 10 million children nationwide. By the end of 2021, there were only two states that were not on boarded, Kwara and Bayelsa. But I\u2019m happy to report that they are now aligned, so we are nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn challenges confronting the programme, Bindir said: \u201cThe first challenge is that there are people who will try to scuttle the programme. There are reports whereby we see schools that don\u2019t exist actually reported. We drop them from the list.\n\n\u201cThere are situations where the number of pupils in schools is being inflated. There are areas where the cooking is not taking place and then we are paying cooks.\n\n\u201cThere are areas where the aggregators for the food are aggregating the wrong food and they are short-changing the children.\u201d",

          "text": "The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is killing people across the globe and should not be dismissed as mild, the World Health Organization insisted Thursday.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the record numbers of people catching the new variant \u2014 which is rapid out-competing the previously-dominant Delta variant in many countries \u2014 meant hospitals were being overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWhile Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild,\u201d Tedros told a press conference.\n\n\u201cJust like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world.\u201d\n\nJust under 9.5 million new Covid-19 cases were reported to the WHO last week \u2014 a record, up 71 percent on the week before.\n\nBut even this was an underestimate, Tedros said, as it did not reflect the backlog of testing around the Christmas-New Year holidays, positive self-tests not registered, and overburdened surveillance systems missing cases.\n\nVaccination targets slipping away\n\nTedros used his first speech of 2022 to slam the way rich nations hogged available vaccine doses last year, saying it had created the perfect breeding ground for the emergence of virus variants.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the world to share out vaccine doses more fairly in 2022, to end the \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d of Covid-19.\n\nTedros wanted every country to have 10 percent of their population vaccinated by the end of September 2021 and 40 percent by the end of December.\n\nNinety-two of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states missed the target set for the end of 2021 \u2014 indeed 36 of them had not even jabbed the first 10 percent, largely due to being unable to access doses.\n\nTedros wants 70 percent jabbed in every country by mid-2022.\n\nOn the current pace of vaccine roll-out, 109 countries will miss that target.\n\n\u201cVaccine inequity is a killer of people and jobs and it undermines a global economic recovery,\u201d said Tedros.\n\n\u201cBooster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected.\u201d\n\nOmicron is not the end\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that Omicron would be the last variant of concern before the pandemic is over.\n\nIn facing the more transmissible Omicron variant, Van Kerkhove urged people to step up the measures they were already taking to protect themselves against the virus.\n\n[READ ALSO] COVID-19: Election Rallies Cancelled As India Sees Omicron Surge\n\n\u201cDo everything that we have been advising better, more comprehensively, more purposefully,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need people to hang in there and really fight.\u201d\n\nVan Kerkhove added that she was stunned by how sloppily some people were wearing facemasks.\n\n\u201cIt needs to cover your nose and mouth\u2026 wearing a mask below your chin is useless,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking ahead to this year, Bruce Aylward, the WHO\u2019s frontman on accessing coronavirus tools, added that there was \u201cno need to finish 2022 in a pandemic\u201d.\n\nBut WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that without vaccine equity, \u201cwe will be sitting here at the end of 2022 having somewhat the same conversation, which, in itself, would be a great tragedy\u201d.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out the option of pardoning the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAlthough he acknowledges the possibility of a political resolution, he believes the IPOB leader must answer for his actions over the years, especially while he was out of the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary,\u201d the President told Channels Television in an exclusive interview that aired on Wednesday. \u201cLet him be listened to. For those who are saying that we should release him, no we cannot release him.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility of political solution; if people behave themselves, all well and good, but you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and thinking that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Chinese Loans: Anybody That Will Help Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Is Welcome \u2013 Buhari\n\nIn November last year, President Buhari had promised to consider the request of some leaders from the South East region to release Kanu who is facing treason charges preferred against him by the Nigerian Government.\n\nAlthough he told the Igbo leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats that they had made an extremely difficult demand, he insisted that the best thing was to subject the IPOB leader to the judicial system.\n\nIn his interview with Channels Television, the President doubted if Kanu was willing to return to the country to clear his name from the allegations against him after he fled in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t dare interfere with \u2013 that is the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cKanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary, but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I never thought really he wants to voluntarily come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian. Let him come here to us and then criticise us here.\u201d\n\nImproved Security?\n\nApart from the trial of the IPOB leader, the President also spoke about a number of burning issues including security, economy, and politics, among others.\n\nHe began his interview with an assessment of his administration\u2019s performance since he assumed office in 2015, especially in the three key areas of security, improving the economy, and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians to be fair with this administration is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now, in the three promises we made \u2013 improving security, improving the economy, and trying to fight corruption; securing the country in the North East, if you ask anybody from Borno State, from Yobe State, from Adamawa State, there are a number of local governments \u2013 about 18 \u2013 that were in the hands of Boko Haram, no local government now is strictly in the hands of Boko Haram or ISWAP. So, in that respect, we have done something,\u201d President Buhari asserted.\n\n\u201cIn the economy, don\u2019t forget and I challenge so many people to go and check with the central bank or NNPC. The production from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. When we came, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South South.\n\n\u201cProduction went down to half a million barrels per day, and coincidentally, the price again collapsed to about $37 per barrel. But look at what we did within the time frame and the resources available to us relative to the government we inherited.\u201d\n\nDespite the gains made so far in improving the economy, the President is not happy with the present state of power because no country can develop without infrastructure, and infrastructure, for him, means road, rail, and power.\n\nHe, however, gave an assurance that his administration was working hard to bridge the gap, although the privatisation of the sector was another problem to worry about.\n\nChinese Loans\n\nPresident Buhari lamented that the owners of the distribution companies bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit, stressing that removing a system and reintroducing one was no joke.\n\nHe went on to defend his government\u2019s decision to source loans from China, saying anyone willing to help Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe take that (loans) where it is necessary \u2026 we got the Chinese to help us in the rail and the roads, how can we turn that down? If we had turned that down maybe between Lagos to Ibadan, you will have to walk,\u201d the President said.\n\n\u201cSo, the Chinese are welcome, anybody that is prepared to come and help us and our infrastructure to do the roads, the rail, and power will be welcomed.\u201d\n\nIn the area of education, President Buhari told Nigerian youths to use their exposure to improve themselves and not see them as tickets to depend on the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school when they work hard when they earn their degree; they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs. You get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person, even in identifying personal problems.\n\n\u201cSo, education is not just meant to hang on to the government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house, start work by 8:00 am, and close by 2 pm.\u201d\n\nThe President also shared his political view where he said he was ready to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, if the National Assembly would include the options of consensus candidate and indirect primary to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.\n\nAsked if he will sign the bill if the lawmakers effect the change in that direction, he affirmed, \u201cYes, I will!

Egbon Lekan Balogun is the most senior in our line and so he is the next in line to the throne.\n\n\u201cFor those asking, my \u2018body and mouth language\u2019 is that Egbon Lekan is my senior and he is next in line to the Olubadan stool.\n\n\u201cI do not have the powers to make anybody Olubadan. In 2017, we instituted a case to challenge the needless reform that Abiola Ajimobi as governor wanted to do. Almost all of us as High Chiefs and members of the Olubadan-in-Council agreed to the filing of a suit to challenge him and we gave the task to Michael Lana.\n\nLana later called me to say some of the High Chiefs told him to remove their names from the suit, leaving only my Egbon Balogun and myself.\n\nTwo weeks after we started the case, Egbon Balogun said he was no longer interested in the case. I asked Lana if I could do it alone and he told he \u2018yes\u2019 and we continued.\n\n\u201cBy the time, there had been a new government headed by Seyi Makinde who said he did not want the distraction of the suit and called for out-of court settlement which we agreed to and did.\n\n\u201cAfter the terms of settlement were agreed to, the court gave a consent judgment based on the terms. But they said they were not happy and instituted two fresh cases which are still in court till today.\n\n\u201cSo, I need people to understand that I am not causing any trouble. The cases that are in court today in respect of the Obaship tussle were instituted by Egbo Balogun and his colleagues who are still calling themselves Obas.\n\n\u201cIt is they that the people should talk to. Let them go and withdraw the cases they instituted.

          "text": "Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has disclosed that there are some entrenched interests desperately seeking to defame and blackmail, because of the 2023 presidential run, a decision he claimed he never told anyone he was interested.\n\nFayemi, who gave the clarification while responding to the alleged planned smear campaign against him over the 2023 presidency, alerted the general public of a fresh plot by some political interests to activate a spate of negative media campaigns against his person in a bid to demarket him.\n\nThe plot, according to Fayemi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, in Ado Ekiti, on Thursday, was to use some faceless political groups and political jobbers from different parts of the country to defame him.\n\nFayemi, however, maintained that he hasn\u2019t told anyone that he was interested in the race and that he should be spared of the agony and refrain from dragging him into unnecessary controversy.\n\nThe Ekiti governor added that his detractors were plotting to deploy the faceless groups to discredit him and portray him as unacceptable to the generality of the people across the six geo-political zones of the country, which he branded as part of the game plans for the 2023 presidential contest.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Dr. Fayemi, has not told anyone that he is in the race for the Presidency of Nigeria. He has always maintained that he is on duty in Ekiti and would like to concentrate on that assignment. What he does afterwards is in the hands of God and he will cross that bridge at the appropriate time. He restated this position during his most recent interview with Arise TV on January 1, 2022.\n\n\u201cSome entrenched interests within the ruling All Progressives Congress, however, seem uncomfortable with the rising profile of the NGF Chairman and have resorted to cheap blackmail aimed at de-marketing him.\n\n\u201cWe urge members of the public to disregard the potpourri of lies and cheap blackmail that could be released in the coming days, while the promoters of this smear campaign are advised to concentrate on marketing their aspiration to the good people of Nigeria without recourse to defamation or character assassination of perceived competitors.\u201d\n\nFayemi added that the Nigerian Constitution stated clearly the qualifications for the position of the President of the country.\n\n\u201cEvery qualified adult has the right to aspire to the number one position. Therefore, we do not believe it is proper, decent or strategic for any aspirant to think his campaign can only gather momentum, when he destroys the reputation of a fellow citizen, who is perceived as a possible opponent,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",

Africa Bridge Capital reportedly declined to comment.\n\nAny buyer of Shell\u2019s assets will also need to show it can deal with future damage to the oil infrastructure which has ravaged Nigeria\u2019s Delta in recent years, the sources said.\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report",

          "text": "The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, applauded the Buhari administration for heeding his appeal and finally declaring bandits terrorists. But the Governor ofcthe North-Central Nigeria state said the president must be bold enough to move a step further to also label some well known violent Fulani groups as terrorists.\n\nThe governor was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s interview on Channels TV.\n\nOrtom said the step taken by the federal government would go a long way in containing the atrocities of the criminals and give innocent citizens the opportunity to go about their legitimate businesses unmolested.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cEven though the federal government\u2019s measures on bandits now seem strong, the security challenges will only be adequately addressed if similar hard position is taken on Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, MACBAN and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), who have vowed and continued to cause mayhem in Benue State and other parts of the country, because of the anti-grazing laws.\n\n\u201cFor us in Benue State, the law has come to stay. It is irrevocable. In fact, we have maintained our position that Benue State has no grazing routes, reserves or areas whatsoever. It was enacted in good faith for peace and order in the state. It was done, among other things, to end the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.\u201d\n\nOrtom also tasked the president to do everything necessary to revamp the ailing economy and save the citizens from poverty. He said, \u201cNigerians have absorbed enough hunger and misery in the hands of the All Progressives Congress (APC) misrule. Or is it possible that Mr. President is not aware that Nigerians are dying from his misrule?\u201d\n\nThe governor dismissed the president\u2019s classification of PDP as a failure, insisting, \u201cAs a critical stakeholder of the PDP, this is completely false. If anyone has failed, it is the Buhari-led APC federal government that has failed by taking Nigeria from top to bottom.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is ready to rescue Nigeria from the insecurity and economic horror placed on Nigerians by the APC.\u201d\n\nOrtom stressed that the party was better prepared with laudable programmes on the welfare of Nigerians and to rebuild the country from the APC tale of woes.\n\nEditor",
