Government will not take any excuse for failure to achieve this directive\u201d.\n\nLalong while commiserating with the victims and families of those killed, assured that they will get justice as Government will stop at nothing to unravel those behind this ugly incidences that continue to disrupt the livelihoods of the people of the Local Government.\n\nLalong also directed the Plateau State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the Peace Building Agency (PBA) to immediately visit the area and assess the level of damage with a view to carrying out immediate intervention and bringing succour to people who are in need as a result of the barbaric attack.",

The police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals. And it\u2019s not only about Abuja and Kaduna. Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity. So, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police would be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security. So, whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nOn if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country were discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies. And we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere. The council, today took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces today, there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategy to that effect as this will not be the first time such charge would be given, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible. So, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organizations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nHe said Buhari was also particularly happy with the news that the Head of INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Garba Umar, has been elected vice president (Africa) and executive committee member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\n\nThe minister said President Buhari was particularly pleased with the outcome of the November 6 gubernatorial election that produced former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Charles Soludo, in the Anambra State governorship election.\n\n\u201cThe president was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies.

          "text": "*Seeks policy intervention to douse appetite for white-collar jobs\n\n*Sets up body of experts to evaluate applications\n\n*FG hails initiative, says it will boost economic growth, reduce graduate unemployment\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday launched the apex bank\u2019s N500 million Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES).\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the scheme in Abuja, Emefiele said the intervention would create an enabling business environment that supports innovation. It would also enable the youth to unleash their entrepreneurial potential, by redirecting their focus from seeking white-collar jobs to embracing a culture of entrepreneurship, he said.\n\nThe initiative, which the CBN governor hinted at earlier this year, was expected to boost entrepreneurship in higher institutions of learning.\n\nEmefiele stressed the need for the environment to provide support in re-orientating, training, and providing a financing model apt to the peculiarities of the sector within which the businesses operate.\n\nHe urged government at all levels to evolve policy measures to support entrepreneurial development among the youth in the country. The CBN governor said this was particularly crucial given that about 600,000 students graduate yearly from Nigerian tertiary institutions without commensurate employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors.\n\nEmefiele said the essence of the intervention was to create a paradigm shift from the obsession for white-collar jobs among graduates and promote entrepreneurship. He said the CBN was particularly concerned about the current level of unemployment among the youth population.\n\nHe explained that the intervention consisted of three main components, including term loan, equity investment, and development grant.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme would make it easy for youths to access credit and create jobs for themselves and others. He warned that the finance to be provided was not a grant but a loan, which should be used for the intended purposes.\n\nHe said entrepreneurship remained an integral part of any economy, adding that entrepreneurs play a key role in driving growth and innovation, which in turn results in job creation.\n\nEmefiele said in line with its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, and its developmental mandate of ensuring inclusive growth in the economy, the central bank had introduced several programmes to create an ecosystem that allowed the flow of affordable credit to the real sector.\n\nHe added that these interventions were industry-led and designed to support the resilience of targeted priority sectors and segments for growth and job creation.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWith an estimated population of 213 million, out of which two-third are youth, aged under 35 years, the nation is faced with a historic opportunity, particularly as the demography continues to create clear evidence of their relevance to economic development, as accentuated by the global recognition of Nigerian tech start-ups and continued growth of businesses in the technology space owned by the youth.\n\n\u201cIn realisation of this, the CBN has introduced several innovative financing programmes designed to extend low-cost financing to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\n\n\u201cThese interventions have continued to receive resounding commendations, as they have proven effective in extending credit to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\u201d\n\nEssentially, he said TIES was conceived as part of measures to promote entrepreneurship development among the graduate and undergraduate youths of Nigerian polytechnics and universities, with the release of the implementation guidelines and the opening of a portal for submission of applications in October 2021.\n\nThe scheme aims at providing an innovative financing model that will support the development of innovative entrepreneurial ideas among graduates and undergraduates of tertiary institutions in the country, the CBN governor said.\n\nThe ceremony also witnessed the inauguration of the Body of Experts (BoE) by the CBN governor. The body, chaired by the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, among other professionals, seeks to evaluate and rank entrepreneurial presentations made by the tertiary institutions under the development (grant) component.\n\nEmefiele said members of the body were professionals of impeccable standing, drawn from the academia, professional bodies, and industry. He said part of their job was to recommend projects with high potential and transformational impact for grant awards.\n\nOther members of the BoE include Chief Financial Officer, First Bank Plc, Mr. Patrick Iyamabo; Mr. Adamu Lawani (Zenith Bank Plc); Ms. Ngover Ihyembe-Nwankwo (Rand Merchant Bank); Mr. Ashafa Ladan (National Universities Commission); Mr. Abbati D.K. Muhammad (National Board for Technical Education); Dr. Friday Okpara of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN); Mr. Tope Fasua (Global Analytics Consulting); Brigadier-General Folusho Oyinlola (National Defence College); and Ms. Bolanle Adekoya (PWC). Mrs. Temitope Akin-Fadeyi of the CBN is the body\u2019s secretary.\n\nEmefiele said the official launch of the TIES and subsequent inauguration of the BoE for the scheme\u2019s development component was a testimony to the important role the youth play in building new blocks for economic growth, particularly as national growth was highly dependent on strong and competitive businesses.\n\nHe said bridging their financing gaps and enhancing access to low-cost credit to drive development of business was a task that could only be addressed by an innovative financing model that correlates with the complexity and dynamics of these small businesses.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme was designed to address three verticals of the segment namely, term loan component, which provides direct credit opportunities to graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities of not more than seven years post-graduation.\n\nHe said an applicant, if successful, should be eligible for a maximum of N5 million for an individual, sole-proprietorship or small company; and a maximum of N25 million for a partnership or company.\n\nThe tenure of the facility is a maximum of five years, with a one-year moratorium, and at an interest of five per cent per annum, which shall revert to nine per cent from March 2022.\n\nThe pilot phase of the scheme is presently being implemented through the Bank of Industry (BOI) with the development of an application portal and processing of submitted applications.\n\nThe equity investment component is designed to support start-ups, existing businesses requiring expansion, and ailing businesses seeking resuscitation, and shall be implemented under the bank\u2019s AGSMEIS equity window.\n\nThe investment limit shall be subject to the limit prescribed by the AGSMEIS guidelines and the investment period not more than 10 years.\n\nEmefiele also noted that the development grant component was aimed at raising awareness and visibility of entrepreneurship among undergraduates of Nigerian tertiary institutions. He explained that here, polytechnics and universities in the country shall compete in a national biennial entrepreneurship competition where undergraduates are presented by the tertiary institutions to pitch innovative entrepreneurial or technological ideas with transformational potential.\n\nAccording to him, three top institutions at the regional levels shall proceed to the national level, where the top five shall be awarded grants ranging between N120 million and N250 million.\n\nHe insisted that the grant awards should be used by the tertiary institutions solely for the development of the award-willing ideas.\n\nFurther commenting on the genesis of the scheme, Emefiele said, \u201cAs you are all aware, at the occasion of the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos, in July 2021, I delivered the convocation lecture, titled, \u201cNational Development and Knowledge Economy in the Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs into the 21st Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that event, I promised that the central bank would seek fresh collaboration with the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions to develop entrepreneurship programmes, and to support \u2013 through the provision of access to finance \u2013 graduates and undergraduates who have bankable ideas, to bring the ideas to fruition.\n\n\u201cEngagements have been on-going between the central bank and the leadership of some of our tertiary institutions regarding the framework for an innovative financing model that will support entrepreneurship development among our graduates and undergraduates.\n\n\u201cThis launch of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme today, is a culmination of the engagements and fulfilment of that promise.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the event included the presentation of commemorative cheques to five youth entrepreneurs whose proposals were found worthy of CBN\u2019s financing under the pilot scheme.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the initiative, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, hailed the efforts of the central bank to ensure that the economy remained afloat despite the disruptions occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresented by the Director, Public Affairs and Bilateral Relations, Office of the SGF, Mr. Olakunle Fashina, Mustapha said, not only would the TIES boost economic growth and reduce graduate unemployment but it would also provide well-grounded incentives for the ever-growing graduate population.\n\nHe urged the tertiary institutions to deploy merit in the selection of the proposed beneficiaries of the scheme as well as monitor key performance indicators as applications are submitted.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion also, Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, described the intervention as a laudable effort by Emefiele to promote entrepreneurial skills in the ivory towers. He said the CBN was playing a significant role in laying a solid foundation for technological development in the tertiary institutions.\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the ministry\u2019s Director, University Education, Mrs. Rakiya Iliyasu, he said no country could make appreciable growth in sound technological innovation and sustainable development without focusing on the base, which is the institutions responsible for training the students in the fields of agribusiness, information technology, creative industries among others.\n\nHe said it was on record that the scheme was designed to create a paradigm shift among graduates from the pursuit of white-collar jobs to entrepreneurship geared towards job creation and economic growth.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG: Nembe Oil Spill Now Under Control",
          "text": "*Proposes stiffer penalty for erring firms\n\n*Aiteo mobilises massive equipment to halt leak\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe federal government yesterday announced that the OML 29 oil spill in Nembe, Bayelsa State, had been brought under control, with necessary personnel and equipment deployed to begin recovery and remediation efforts.\n\nThis came more than three weeks after the eruption that affected several communities in the state.\n\nMinister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, who made disclosed the control of the spill at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe unfortunate incident was said to have been brought under control after the Aiteo Eastern Exploration Company (AEEPCO) succeeded in mobilising heavy equipment to the site of the Santa Barbara wellhead leak, in what it described as a \u201cwell kill\u201d operation.\n\nIkeazor likened the incident to the atomic bomb site in Hiroshima City in Japan, which was devastated when the Allied Forces dropped a bomb on it during the Second World War.\n\nShe explained, \u201cThe situation has been brought under control. I got a brief from the Director General, National Oil Spillage Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), who was out on the field. So, now, work has to start on the proper clean up.\n\n\u201cSo, is this something we must tackle head-on? We are beyond talking and having workshop. On the issue of penalties, I mentioned earlier the review of NOSDRA bill. You know most of the Acts we have passed years ago. You will see that they will give maybe N100 fine, anyone can pay that and go back and re-pollute.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, yesterday, Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, who spoke about his visit to the host community for on the spot assessment of the impacted area, had assured that he would produce a report, after the inspection, which would be submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for immediate action.\n\nSylva, also disclosed that the federal government and Aiteo oil company had moved to contain the massive oil spill. He thanked the host community for their peaceful conduct.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cThe company, Aiteo, is making reasonable effort to contain the spill and ensure that the Christmas tree is repaired.\n\n\u201cWe will produce a report that will be submitted to Mr. President. We want to thank the community for being peaceful and not taking the laws into their hands.\u201d\n\nAiteo, in a telephone chat yesterday night, confirmed the leak had been contained, stating that the company has already embarked on measures to control the spillage, shutdown and kill the well.\n\nTHISDAY learnt yesterday that AEEPCO had as of last night fully mobilised to the site and had reinforced its efforts to put an end to the saga.\n\nVideos of the operation sighted by THISDAY indicated that while the, \u201cwell kill\u201d operation was going on, several barges carrying cranes and other equipment were on their way to the location to begin recovery of the hydrocarbons.\n\n\u201cThese are pumping and stimulation equipment loaded with calcium fluoride for the well kill operation. To minimise down time, what we are doing is to arrange all key lines. We have begun work already. By the time this barges get there, the leak must have been arrested.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s just for us to hook up the lines and the hoses into the well. We have cranes and at least three barges and with these, the spill will be contained in no time,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, assured that \u201cthe matter would be resolved in a way that will not negatively impact the area.\u201d\n\nIkeazor stressed the need to put an end to artisanal refineries, which she said had continued to cause pollution in the Niger Delta. She also disclosed plans to institute stiffer penalty for companies involved in oil spill in the country, adding that the operating company is blaming locals for the latest incident in OML29, Nembe.\n\nIkeazor said the ministry was engaging other relevant government agencies to come up with stiffer punishments for erring oil multinationals.\n\nShe said, \u201cI got briefings and what I saw in terms of the pollution either through oil refining or illegal oil refining and otherwise \u2013 the devastation of the Niger Delta is massive. As we are cleaning up, what we are cleaning up is minute compared to the devastation going on.\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that government needs to tackle head-on. I hope they would have put the picture on (slide show), it was like a Hiroshima site.\u201d\n\nThe minister said a bill was being worked out to amend the law establishing NOSDRA to build its capacity and give it \u201cthe needed teeth to bite.\u201d\n\nShe said the operating company of the OML29 in Nembe had blamed the most recent oil spillage in the country on sabotage by the locals.\n\nAccording to her, something must be done about the on-going gas flaring\n\nShe said the country could not be committed to zero net emission and be flaring gas at the same time.\n\nIkeazor said, \u201cOn the Santa Babara Aiteo oil spills, you remember the Ministry of Environment issued a statement stating what happened and the action being taken. It\u2019s a collective action between the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Ministry of Environment, and the oil company involved.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond the oil companies giving out palliatives, they must put measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening.\n\n\u201cThey are also claiming that the spill was due to sabotage by the local communities. We are going to have a targeted approach to illegal bunkering, tampering with oil installation and artisanal mining in the Niger Delta to get alternative livelihood for the young people of the Niger Delta, so that they would desist from this because it is further polluting the environment.\n\n\u201cWe need to put stiffer penalties, build the capacity of NOSDRA, which is the regulatory agency in the oil sector, to be able to have the teeth to bite. Without enhancing their capacity and reaffirming the legal framework, getting it stronger, they cannot do much.

She said the federal government was hoping to reintroduce clean cookstove and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cookstove initiative to ameliorate the problem and protect the nation\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nOn the Ogoni clean-up exercise, the minister noted that the work could not be completed in one or two years as she stressed the need to end artisanal refining of crude oil.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe must accelerate also the Ogoni cleanup, to make sure that the remediation is completed in time for the good people of Ogoni. But at the same time, we must tackle the issue of artisanal refining because as we are cleaning, some are still polluting the environment and we ask that this must stop, for us to have a clean and decent environment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the United States-led coalition\u2019s strategy to cool oil prices, the market remained steady yesterday, with Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil, still above $80 per barrel.\n\nPrecisely, Brent crude futures gained seven cents to $82.32 a barrel yesterday, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell marginally by 12 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $78.27 a barrel, still a far cry from the coalition\u2019s expectations.\n\nInvestors are waiting for how major producers respond to the emergency oil release designed to tone down prices, with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and allies, called OPEC+, expected to meet on December 1st and 2nd to set policy.\n\nBut OPEC expects the United States\u2019 release to swell a surplus in oil markets by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a source from the group said, although for now the decision by the coalition has largely backfired.\n\nThe United States and other high oil-consuming nations, including China, Britain, India, Japan and South Korea, had on Tuesday made good their threat to counter a slower-than-expected release of oil barrels by OPEC in a coordinated bid to reduce rising crude prices.\n\nOPEC+ producers have repeatedly ignored calls for more crude by the US President, Joe Biden, prompting the country to mobilise a handful of high oil consuming nations to release the commodity from their Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR).\n\nCrude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago.\n\nWhile the US announcement is for a release of 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of the country\u2019s demand, India would release 5 million barrels, while Britain would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves, according to the agreement.\n\nOPEC has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month \u2013 a pace Washington sees as too slow.\n\nNigeria, an OPEC member has said that even if prices fall to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s situation has been further worsened by the inability of mostly African countries led by Nigeria to meet their allocation, due largely to waning investment, ageing upstream infrastructure and disruptions by some local host communities.\n\nThree sources told Reuters yesterday that OPEC+ was not discussing pausing its oil output increases, despite the decision by the United States, Japan, India and others to release emergency oil stocks.\n\nOPEC members the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait said they were fully committed to the OPEC+ agreement and had no prior stance ahead of next week\u2019s meeting. Nigeria, a strong member of the organisation has always aligned with the decision of the majority.\n\nIraq, also an OPEC member, said it backs continuing OPEC+\u2019s existing plan of raising output by 400,000 bpd a month, saying the outlook for the oil market was unclear due to turbulence in global markets.\n\nHigh oil prices have added to inflationary concerns, with the coordinated release expected to add around 70-80 million barrels of crude supply to markets, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe US Department of Energy had launched an auction to sell 32 million barrels of strategic petroleum reserves(SPR) for delivery between late December to April 2022. It plans to release another 18 million barrels soon.\n\nSome OPEC delegates warned this week that releasing strategic reserves may lead to the alliance holding back crude supply in January, a development that will further starve the market of its much needed supply.\n\nIn addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has accused Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major energy producers of creating \u201cartificial tightness\u201d in global oil and gas markets, urging OPEC+ to accelerate the return of supplies.\n\nPredictions on the response are mixed. Citigroup Inc. said OPEC+ is likely to stick to its planned increase of 400,000 barrels a day for January because reducing supply would erode the group\u2019s claim of providing public good by stabilising oil markets, while others feel the alliance will suspend the hike to provide a buffer to demand headwinds.\n\nHowever, the OPEC advisory body has predicted that the excess in markets would expand by 1.1 million barrels a day in January and February to 2.3 million and 3.7 million a day, respectively. That is, if 66 million barrels are injected by major consumers over the two-month period, according to a document leaked to the public.\n\nIf Nigeria keeps to its assurances to ramp up production by the end of this year, according to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the country would be producing as much as 1.8 million bpd by December ending.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has projected the country\u2019s economy to grow by 3.0 percent in 2021, up from negative growth of -1.8 percent in 2020.\n\nCBN governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele who made the projection while delivering his Keynote Address at the 56th CIBN Annual Bankers Dinner in Lagos on Friday, noted that although Covid-19 pandemic had huge negative impact on the Nigerian economy, the efforts of monetary and fiscal authorities have made quick recovery possible.\n\nEmefiele also noted that the country\u2019s Inflation is expected to continue on its downward trajectory into 2022 as continued interventions along with the onset of the harvest season aid improved supply of food items, which would further help to decelerate inflationary pressures.\n\nSpeaking about how the CBN responded to the challenges posed by the pandemic, Emefiele said, \u201cFirst, the Central Bank of Nigeria worked with the fiscal authorities in instituting strong policy support measures capped under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), which was designed to contain the effects of the pandemic, restore stability to the economy by helping households and businesses affected by the pandemic and to lift our economy out of the woods through massive interventions to critical sectors.\n\n\u201cUnder this plan, the monetary and fiscal authorities collectively mobilized and injected over N5trillion to support households and businesses. It is gratifying to state that the Central Bank of Nigeria deployed more than N3.5trillion, \u2013 about 4.1 percent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP to critical sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, electricity, and healthcare in order to stimulate and help the economy recover from the deep shock. Other specific policy measures undertaken include.\n\n-Reduction of the monetary policy rate from 13.5 to 11.5 percent to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\n-Reduction of the interest rate on CBN intervention loans from 9 to 5 percent.\n\nExtension of the moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facility to March 2022.\n\n-Granted regulatory forbearance that allow banks restructure loans given to sectors severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n-Strengthened the Loan to Deposit ratio policy, which has resulted in a significant rise in loans provided by financial institutions. Total gross credit rose by over 21.1 percent over the past year, from N19.4 trillion to N23.5 trillion.\n\n-Created a N50 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the Nirsal Microfinance Bank, against which N363.5 billion has been disbursed to over 767,000 Nigerian households and micro businesses.\n\n-Mobilized key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, under the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) team that raised N39.646 to support the fight against the scourge. The funds were used to support three (3) key priority areas:(i) development of 39 fully equipped isolation centres including Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and molecular testing labs and procurement of medical equipment such as PCR test kits across the country; (ii) provision of palliatives in the form of essential food items to 1.7 million households, an equivalent of 8 million Nigerians; and (iii) improving awareness in rural awareness on the COVID-19 virus and capacity building for community health workers.\n\n-Created a N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors; of which 53 major manufacturing projects, 21 agriculture related projects and 13 service projects are being funded from this facility.\n\n-Creation of a NGN100 billion intervention fund for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions. We have increased this fund to N200 billion to accommodate more players in the healthcare sector, such as phytomedicine practitioners and manufacturers of medical devices and vaccines. Our primary focus is to create a hub where medical officers can have access to diagnostic equipment to carry out quality medical services at an affordable price for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor noted that so far, over N107.7 billion has been released to support 114 healthcare projects, including six (6) greenfield (new) and 108 are expansionary (brownfield).\n\nThe projects financed, he said, included cancer treatment centres, medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, dental services, eye clinics, and other healthcare service providers.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to inform you that the intervention programs have contributed to the increased bed space in our hospitals, and improved healthcare productivity as evident in the increased number of successfully treated Covid 19 patients,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cThese developmental initiatives combined with our monetary and financial policies have helped to support the recovery of our economy and in re-aligning general macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the measures taken by the apex bank led to robust economic recovery, with GDP growth at 4.03 percent in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a result of these measures, we witnessed robust economic recovery as GDP growth stood at 4.03% in the 3rd quarter of 2021, following the 5.01% growth recorded in the 2nd Quarter of 2021. The economy has remained on a positive growth path for four consecutive quarters after the recession in the 3rd quarter of 2020. 41 out of the 46 sectors assessed in the 3rd quarter by NBS, recorded positive growth, as growth was driven by significant improvements in the non-oil sector, particularly, Agriculture Manufacturing, Trade, ICT, Construction, Finance and Transportation. We have also witnessed a gradual recovery in manufacturing output growth as the Manufacturing PMI index rose to 47.3 points in October 2021 from 44.9 in January 2021.\n\n\u201cOur interventions particularly in the manufacturing and the agriculture sectors significantly helped to encourage continuous improvements in growth in these two key sectors of our economy. Today, our food production systems have become more sustainable due to the improved output at our farms and local factories. Output of staple commodities such as rice, maize, palm oil and tomatoes have grown significantly, and we have also seen increased efforts of our local manufacturing firms to engage in backward integration efforts. Second, a visit to any major retail chain will reveal an increasing number of high quality made in Nigeria products relative to imported goods, which is helping to increase domestic production, generate employment and wealth in our country. If these intervention efforts were not carried out by the monetary and fiscal authorities, our economy would have been in a grim state.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also noted that the efforts of the apex bank have helped to reduce inflation despite the disruptions in the supply chain caused by Covid-19.\n\n\u201cInflation has continued to moderate for seven consecutive months, as it declined from 18.17 percent in March 2021 to 15.9 percent in October 2021 supported by improved output of staple food items. Inflation however still remains above our benchmark, which means efforts must continue to be made to slow down the pace of the rise in prices.\u201d\n\nOn External Reserves, he said: \u201cSupported by our demand management policy, in addition to support from the successful issuance of the $4bn Eurobond and the IMF SDR, our external reserves today stands at over $41.4bn which is enough to support 9 months of imports. This is not just a morale booster for both foreign direct and portfolio investors willing to invest in the economy, but it provides significant fire power to support our domestic industries that need to import critical machines and equipment for domestic production and exports.\u201d\n\nOn Exchange Rate, Emefiele said, \u201cAs a result of our demand management policy, the naira has remained largely stable around N411/US$1 at the I&E window particularly since the discontinuation of FX allocation to Bureau De Change operators along with the convergence between the CBN and NAFEX rates. Banks are now able to meet the demands of their customers seeking forex for SMEs, school fees, medical and PTAs, which has reduced the need of customers to rely on alternative providers of foreign exchange. Average daily Fx turnover at the I&E window is now over $250million, up from $40million in April 2020.\n\n\u201cOur current account deficit has narrowed significantly, from a huge deficit of 4.53% of GDP in the 4th quarter of 2020 to negative 0.44% of GDP in the 2nd quarter of 2021 due to a surplus position in the goods account. The surplus position in the goods account is due to a reduction in imports, increase in crude oil and gas export receipts, and improvement in remittance inflows. Remittance inflows have been supported by our naira for dollar program, and we have seen a surge in remittance inflows from over $5m per week in June 2020 to over $100m per week in October 2021.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the outlook of the economy, he said, \u201cFollowing the impact of the various accommodative policy measures, our economy made a swift exit from the recession. Unlike the five quarters it took to exit the previous recession, the economy rebounded after just two quarters of contractions, underpinning the resilience of the economy amid greater policy support. I am pleased to note that growth has returned to pre-covid levels due to the accommodative policy support provided by the monetary and fiscal authorities.\n\n\u201cAlthough uncertainties remain around the mutating Delta virus, prospects of a broad-based economic recovery in Nigeria remain bright as efforts are made to improve access to vaccines for Nigerians, in addition to measures aimed at implementing safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these growth enhancing policy measures, we project that GDP will grow at 3.0 percent for 2021 up from -1.8 percent in 2020. Inflation is expected to continue on its downward trajectory into 2022 as continued interventions along with the onset of the harvest season aid improved supply of food items, which would further help to decelerate inflationary pressures.\u201d",

          "title": "Manufacturers, Others Jittery Over Electricity, Petrol Subsidy Removal",
          "text": "With the planned total removal of subsidy on electricity and petrol by the federal government next year, stakeholders have warned that this could fuel the already tensed economic atmosphere in the country.\n\nStakeholders are jittery over the development, saying it is bound to impact negatively on their operations, as well as the quality of life of most Nigerians who are already grappling with harsh economic conditions amidst dwindling incomes.\n\nOf particular concern to manufacturers is the high cost of electricity and the impact it will have on production as they are already paying millions of Naira in energy bills on a daily basis.\n\nMany Nigerians are worried this move by the government could heighten the already tensed economic atmosphere in the country even as some experts believe subsidy removal could save the country trillions of naira spent annually on subsidy which could be invested in sustainable infrastructural development. They, however, advised that caution must be taken to ensure the best outcomes for the government and people of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to them, Nigerians are currently battling with subsidy removal on gas coupled with inflation amidst low disposable incomes, so the removal of electricity and petrol subsidies next year would be too much of a burden for the masses to bear.\n\nPetrol subsidy has cost Nigeria N864 billion ($2.1 billion) in the first nine months of 2021, up from N107 billion in 2020, to reach the highest deduction in six years, as rising oil prices increase the cost of imports.\n\nFinance minister, Zainab Ahmed, said the government planned to remove the subsidy on PMS (petrol) by the middle of next year and cushion the effect with N5,000 monthly payments to 40 million poorest Nigerians, which translates to about N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the National Assembly (NASS) declared that the proposed N2.4trillion for palliatives was not provided for in the budget even as it queried the modality for distributing the palliatives.\n\nTo the former director-general at the West Africa Institute for Financial and Economic Management (WAIFEM) and the chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Professor Akpan Ekpo, there ought to be a gradual phasing out of the subsidy as doing it abruptly would have an adverse effect on the economy.\n\nHe said the impact of subsidy removal will be felt by both demand and supply, with more emphasis on the demand side.\n\n\u201cFor me, once you touch the fuel price, it affects every other commodity; all prices will go up. We call that structural inflation.\n\n\u201cSo, I will advise that it should be implemented in phases and the money you would have paid for subsidy, you use that for infrastructure development, education health, roads, but it should be phased.\u201d\n\nOn the proposed transport subsidy, he said it is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt is to cushion the adverse impact of the removal. Once you remove subsidy, transport fares will go up as well as other prices. Already, food prices are at a very high level, but how they will go about it is what is unclear. Some countries that removed subsidy years ago gave workers vouchers to buy petrol, but not to rich people. So, I think it is a step in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, head of research, Agusto & Co, Jimi Ogbobine, noted that the economic implication of fuel subsidy \u201cis that we spend over N1 trillion every year on fuel subsidy. Asides this, the oil and gas sector is losing money, particularly the downstream, because it leads to constriction of investment in that sector, and constriction of investment leads to weaker profitability of the sector, which also affects what the government will earn in taxes.\n\n\u201cIf we look at all of this, then I think this government should not delay in making this decision because it then becomes more difficult doing it in 2023. If they don\u2019t do it before 2023, it means that this government will be passing it to the next government and that government will have to do it early enough in its own administration. 2022 is like the last window of opportunity that this government has to make that decision because we know that come 2023, they will not be able to do it.\u201d\n\nOn the transport subsidy, he said with over N2 trillion planned, it may not be economically viable.\n\n\u201cOn the transport subsidy, we need to see what the budget implication of that will come down to. The simple arithmetic of that is that it will cost us over N2 trillion, which then questions the basis behind it because it then becomes even more than the initial fuel subsidy,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nAn economist and chief executive of the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Muda Yusuf, said: \u201cI believe that there is a need to creatively manage the transition from the current pricing regime to a fully deregulated arrangement.\n\n\u201cIt is a tricky issue which could pose a serious challenge to government, if not tactically managed. The reality is that the sentiments among the citizenry are not favourable to the deregulation of petroleum product pricing or petroleum subsidy removal. Even some of the ruling elite are curiously not persuaded on the justification for the subsidy removal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the policy transition is not properly managed, the risk of a social and political backlash could be quite high. No doubt there is a sound economic and business case in favour of fuel subsidy removal, but the social and political contexts are equally critical.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the subsidy is not sustainable, which is why there is need to accelerate engagement with the relevant stakeholders to come up with a policy transition strategy that is sustainable, realistic and pragmatic. The conversation should not only be economic, but also social and political,\u201d he averred.\n\nOn subsidy payment in the power sector, Yusuf argued that the subsidy argument is slightly different in the case of electricity.\n\nHe observed that, already, some progress has been made towards a market-driven electricity framework.\n\n\u201cWe already have the willing-buyer, willing-seller policy. There is also a market segmentation model that has been adopted by the electricity distribution companies (DisCos). Different pricing applies to different segments.\n\n\u201cThis is also a move towards a purely market driven electricity market. It is true that to sustain private investment in the electricity sector, the subsidy should be discontinued. But the transition needs to be strategically managed because of the political and social contexts.\u201d\n\nTo the director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr Chinyere Almona, the removal of subsidy is becoming more and more unavoidable looking at the pressure it puts on public revenue.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe have always advocated that we need to have a fully deregulated oil and gas sector in Nigeria and have cost reflective pricing for the oil products. Spending a whooping N250 billion monthly on fuel subsidy at a time when our debt to revenue ratio is above 73 per cent is not economically wise.\u201d\n\nShe said the immediate implication of removing subsidy will be the increase in transport and logistics, which will transfer to higher costs for goods and services, rising inflation, more people thrown under the poverty line due to diminishing purchasing power, and likely rise in unemployment level.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more money freed for other purposes, the government should be able to spend more on utilities to cushion the effects of the removal. With a cost reflective pricing, smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries will reduce due to reduced margins.\n\n\u201cGovernment will make more money to attend to Nigeria\u2019s infrastructural deficits, reduce debts, and attract more foreign investors to the sector, among others. The fact remains that the oil products most used by the masses had been deregulated before now \u2013 I mean kerosene and diesel. So why can\u2019t we also leave petrol price deregulated? Moreover, one of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act is the removal of fuel subsidy,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the proposed N5,000 to be given to poor people, the LCCI DG said: \u201cWe wonder how the selection will be made and from what database or register. What is the guarantee that the money will end up with the right people needing the intervention?\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems with our social investment programmes is that we do not have a systematic methodology on how beneficiaries are selected. Again, we need to do the planning to see if it is more beneficial to give out the money or spend more on public goods. We can spend more on rail infrastructure, spend more on digital infrastructure to support work from home and virtual events, and this reduces pressure on the roads.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) is demanding the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry within six months in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nChairman of MOMAN, Olumide Adeosun, disclosed that the association had made its position on the issue known to the federal government through a letter to the minister of state for petroleum resources.\n\nHe said the group expects a free, fair and competitive downstream sector, stressing that Nigeria has the potential to become Africa\u2019s energy hub if the PIA is properly He stressed the need for the PIA implementation committee to work with industry practitioners and operators to ensure that there is no disconnect between the policy provisions and actual practice.\n\n\u201cMaking the transition to a fully competitive pricing-oriented downstream sector will require the collective engagement and resolve of all stakeholders. I assure you that MOMAN will continue to be at the forefront in bridging the government and the private sector gap in ensuring that Nigeria has a viable energy sector,\u201d he stressed.\n\nA study of the allocations for the ministries of finance and petroleum resources in the 2022 budget showed that the Federal Government made no provision for petrol subsidy for the coming year.\n\nHowever, LEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that the commodity might still be subsidised in 2022 as the country\u2019s sole importer of petrol, the NNPC, stated that there had been no counter order on subsidy from the federal government.\n\nThe NNPC insisted that until negotiations with labour unions were concluded, the price of the commodity would remain the same, stressing that the minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, had earlier stated this.\n\nOn his part, the national president of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association on Nigeria, Chinedu Okoronkwo, told our correspondent that the situation may remain as government has not asked them to adjust their pumps.\n\nMeanwhile, the labour groups said the move by the federal government will further impoverish the masses, asking questions on the commitment of the government to subsidy removal.\n\nThe president, Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Dr Tommy Okon, said: \u201cOn electricity, are Nigerians enjoying the electricity today? Should such money (N2.4trn palliative) not be channeled to assist in that sector so that small and medium scale businesses can benefit? They have lost focus on what and how to offer good governance, hence, they are embarking on trial-and-error policy.\n\n\u201cDid they not tell us that the subsidy was removed before? Then which subsidy are they removing now? I believe it is time the EFCC and other anti-graft agencies investigate those corporate bodies who are deceiving the country in the name of subsidy or else we keep hearing of subsidy removal every time.\u201d\n\nSaying the country keeps talking of subsidy rather than bringing back to full capacity the use of the four nation\u2019s refineries, he added that the proposed N2.4 trillion palliative can be used to maintain the refineries or set up additional ones, rather than depending on importation of petroleum products.\n\nThe general secretary, Federation of Informal Workers of Nigeria (FIWON), Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, said the removal of subsidy would have an impact on Nigerian workers as the minimum wage of N30,000 would by then be too paltry and meager to do meaningful thing.\n\nOn its part, the National Union of Textile Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGTWN) stated that the removal will further impoverish the people, saying government and politicians are insensitive to the suffering of the poor citizens.\n\nThe president, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba, had posited that the union continues to maintain its rejection of deregulation based on import-driven model, noting that it is difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country is the only country among the OPEC member countries that cannot produce its own refined petroleum products and thus adopts the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import-driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products.

          "text": "With the planned total removal of subsidy on electricity and petrol by the federal government next year, stakeholders have warned that this could fuel the already tensed economic atmosphere in the country.\n\nStakeholders are jittery over the development, saying it is bound to impact negatively on their operations, as well as the quality of life of most Nigerians who are already grappling with harsh economic conditions amidst dwindling incomes.\n\nOf particular concern to manufacturers is the high cost of electricity and the impact it will have on production as they are already paying millions of Naira in energy bills on a daily basis.\n\nMany Nigerians are worried this move by the government could heighten the already tensed economic atmosphere in the country even as some experts believe subsidy removal could save the country trillions of naira spent annually on subsidy which could be invested in sustainable infrastructural development. They, however, advised that caution must be taken to ensure the best outcomes for the government and people of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to them, Nigerians are currently battling with subsidy removal on gas coupled with inflation amidst low disposable incomes, so the removal of electricity and petrol subsidies next year would be too much of a burden for the masses to bear.\n\nPetrol subsidy has cost Nigeria N864 billion ($2.1 billion) in the first nine months of 2021, up from N107 billion in 2020, to reach the highest deduction in six years, as rising oil prices increase the cost of imports.\n\nFinance minister, Zainab Ahmed, said the government planned to remove the subsidy on PMS (petrol) by the middle of next year and cushion the effect with N5,000 monthly payments to 40 million poorest Nigerians, which translates to about N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the National Assembly (NASS) declared that the proposed N2.4trillion for palliatives was not provided for in the budget even as it queried the modality for distributing the palliatives.\n\nTo the former director-general at the West Africa Institute for Financial and Economic Management (WAIFEM) and the chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Professor Akpan Ekpo, there ought to be a gradual phasing out of the subsidy as doing it abruptly would have an adverse effect on the economy.\n\nHe said the impact of subsidy removal will be felt by both demand and supply, with more emphasis on the demand side.\n\n\u201cFor me, once you touch the fuel price, it affects every other commodity; all prices will go up. We call that structural inflation.\n\n\u201cSo, I will advise that it should be implemented in phases and the money you would have paid for subsidy, you use that for infrastructure development, education health, roads, but it should be phased.\u201d\n\nOn the proposed transport subsidy, he said it is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt is to cushion the adverse impact of the removal. Once you remove subsidy, transport fares will go up as well as other prices. Already, food prices are at a very high level, but how they will go about it is what is unclear. Some countries that removed subsidy years ago gave workers vouchers to buy petrol, but not to rich people. So, I think it is a step in the right direction,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, head of research, Agusto & Co, Jimi Ogbobine, noted that the economic implication of fuel subsidy \u201cis that we spend over N1 trillion every year on fuel subsidy. Asides this, the oil and gas sector is losing money, particularly the downstream, because it leads to constriction of investment in that sector, and constriction of investment leads to weaker profitability of the sector, which also affects what the government will earn in taxes.\n\n\u201cIf we look at all of this, then I think this government should not delay in making this decision because it then becomes more difficult doing it in 2023. If they don\u2019t do it before 2023, it means that this government will be passing it to the next government and that government will have to do it early enough in its own administration. 2022 is like the last window of opportunity that this government has to make that decision because we know that come 2023, they will not be able to do it.\u201d\n\nOn the transport subsidy, he said with over N2 trillion planned, it may not be economically viable.\n\n\u201cOn the transport subsidy, we need to see what the budget implication of that will come down to. The simple arithmetic of that is that it will cost us over N2 trillion, which then questions the basis behind it because it then becomes even more than the initial fuel subsidy,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nAn economist and chief executive of the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Muda Yusuf, said: \u201cI believe that there is a need to creatively manage the transition from the current pricing regime to a fully deregulated arrangement.\n\n\u201cIt is a tricky issue which could pose a serious challenge to government, if not tactically managed. The reality is that the sentiments among the citizenry are not favourable to the deregulation of petroleum product pricing or petroleum subsidy removal. Even some of the ruling elite are curiously not persuaded on the justification for the subsidy removal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the policy transition is not properly managed, the risk of a social and political backlash could be quite high. No doubt there is a sound economic and business case in favour of fuel subsidy removal, but the social and political contexts are equally critical.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the subsidy is not sustainable, which is why there is need to accelerate engagement with the relevant stakeholders to come up with a policy transition strategy that is sustainable, realistic and pragmatic. The conversation should not only be economic, but also social and political,\u201d he averred.\n\nOn subsidy payment in the power sector, Yusuf argued that the subsidy argument is slightly different in the case of electricity.\n\nHe observed that, already, some progress has been made towards a market-driven electricity framework.\n\n\u201cWe already have the willing-buyer, willing-seller policy. There is also a market segmentation model that has been adopted by the electricity distribution companies (DisCos). Different pricing applies to different segments.\n\n\u201cThis is also a move towards a purely market driven electricity market. It is true that to sustain private investment in the electricity sector, the subsidy should be discontinued. But the transition needs to be strategically managed because of the political and social contexts.\u201d\n\nTo the director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr Chinyere Almona, the removal of subsidy is becoming more and more unavoidable looking at the pressure it puts on public revenue.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe have always advocated that we need to have a fully deregulated oil and gas sector in Nigeria and have cost reflective pricing for the oil products. Spending a whooping N250 billion monthly on fuel subsidy at a time when our debt to revenue ratio is above 73 per cent is not economically wise.\u201d\n\nShe said the immediate implication of removing subsidy will be the increase in transport and logistics, which will transfer to higher costs for goods and services, rising inflation, more people thrown under the poverty line due to diminishing purchasing power, and likely rise in unemployment level.\n\n\u201cHowever, with more money freed for other purposes, the government should be able to spend more on utilities to cushion the effects of the removal. With a cost reflective pricing, smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries will reduce due to reduced margins.\n\n\u201cGovernment will make more money to attend to Nigeria\u2019s infrastructural deficits, reduce debts, and attract more foreign investors to the sector, among others. The fact remains that the oil products most used by the masses had been deregulated before now \u2013 I mean kerosene and diesel. So why can\u2019t we also leave petrol price deregulated? Moreover, one of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act is the removal of fuel subsidy,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the proposed N5,000 to be given to poor people, the LCCI DG said: \u201cWe wonder how the selection will be made and from what database or register. What is the guarantee that the money will end up with the right people needing the intervention?\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems with our social investment programmes is that we do not have a systematic methodology on how beneficiaries are selected. Again, we need to do the planning to see if it is more beneficial to give out the money or spend more on public goods. We can spend more on rail infrastructure, spend more on digital infrastructure to support work from home and virtual events, and this reduces pressure on the roads.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) is demanding the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry within six months in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nChairman of MOMAN, Olumide Adeosun, disclosed that the association had made its position on the issue known to the federal government through a letter to the minister of state for petroleum resources.\n\nHe said the group expects a free, fair and competitive downstream sector, stressing that Nigeria has the potential to become Africa\u2019s energy hub if the PIA is properly He stressed the need for the PIA implementation committee to work with industry practitioners and operators to ensure that there is no disconnect between the policy provisions and actual practice.\n\n\u201cMaking the transition to a fully competitive pricing-oriented downstream sector will require the collective engagement and resolve of all stakeholders. I assure you that MOMAN will continue to be at the forefront in bridging the government and the private sector gap in ensuring that Nigeria has a viable energy sector,\u201d he stressed.\n\nA study of the allocations for the ministries of finance and petroleum resources in the 2022 budget showed that the Federal Government made no provision for petrol subsidy for the coming year.\n\nHowever, LEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that the commodity might still be subsidised in 2022 as the country\u2019s sole importer of petrol, the NNPC, stated that there had been no counter order on subsidy from the federal government.\n\nThe NNPC insisted that until negotiations with labour unions were concluded, the price of the commodity would remain the same, stressing that the minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, had earlier stated this.\n\nOn his part, the national president of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association on Nigeria, Chinedu Okoronkwo, told our correspondent that the situation may remain as government has not asked them to adjust their pumps.\n\nMeanwhile, the labour groups said the move by the federal government will further impoverish the masses, asking questions on the commitment of the government to subsidy removal.\n\nThe president, Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Dr Tommy Okon, said: \u201cOn electricity, are Nigerians enjoying the electricity today? Should such money (N2.4trn palliative) not be channeled to assist in that sector so that small and medium scale businesses can benefit? They have lost focus on what and how to offer good governance, hence, they are embarking on trial-and-error policy.\n\n\u201cDid they not tell us that the subsidy was removed before? Then which subsidy are they removing now? I believe it is time the EFCC and other anti-graft agencies investigate those corporate bodies who are deceiving the country in the name of subsidy or else we keep hearing of subsidy removal every time.\u201d\n\nSaying the country keeps talking of subsidy rather than bringing back to full capacity the use of the four nation\u2019s refineries, he added that the proposed N2.4 trillion palliative can be used to maintain the refineries or set up additional ones, rather than depending on importation of petroleum products.\n\nThe general secretary, Federation of Informal Workers of Nigeria (FIWON), Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, said the removal of subsidy would have an impact on Nigerian workers as the minimum wage of N30,000 would by then be too paltry and meager to do meaningful thing.\n\nOn its part, the National Union of Textile Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGTWN) stated that the removal will further impoverish the people, saying government and politicians are insensitive to the suffering of the poor citizens.\n\nThe president, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba, had posited that the union continues to maintain its rejection of deregulation based on import-driven model, noting that it is difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country is the only country among the OPEC member countries that cannot produce its own refined petroleum products and thus adopts the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import-driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products. This situation will definitely be compounded by the astronomical devaluation of the Naira which currently goes for N560 to $1 in the parallel market.\n\n\u201cThus, any attempt to compare the price of petrol in Nigeria to other countries would be set on a faulty premise as it would be akin to comparing apples to mangoes,\u201d he said.\n\nStating that the contemplation by government to increase the price of petrol by more than 200 per cent is a perfect recipe for aggravated hyper-inflation and astronomical increase in the price of goods and services, he added that this will open a wide door to unintended social consequences such as degeneration of the current insecurity and possibly citizen revolt.\n\n\u201cThis is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for. The argument that the complete surrender of the price of petrol to market forces would normalise the curve of demand and supply as its being wrongly attributed to the current market realities with cooking gas, diesel and kerosene is very obtuse.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these commodities which Nigeria can easily produce have been priced out of the reach of most Nigerian families with a majority of our people resorting to tree felling and charcoal for their energy needs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) had earlier asked the federal government to completely exit the subsidy regime.

The declaration was even backed by the order of the Court, but as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration on IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results.\n\n\u201cThey have not been banned from travelling to other countries, while their citizenship remains intact; it has not been denounced. \u201cSo what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cVery few herdsmen are bandits if you go through their population.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the licence to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them.\n\n\u201cIt will cause more mayhem. The declaration will not change anything, it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u2018It is a socio-political problem\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them.\n\n\u201cWe told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because government have accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them.\n\n\u201cThere has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for every one.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it. Before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us, the Fulani have suffered so much.\n\n\u201cThey have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration. They should have sense of belonging,\u201d Gumi said.",

          "title": "Abuja-Kaduna railroad passengers as endangered species",
          "text": "At a time the federal government is fighting hard to win the war against insecurity, hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers have resolved to strike on the Abuja-Kaduna railroad attacking travellers. KEHINDE OSASONA in this report reflects on the recent attacks.\n\nAlthough the report of bomb explosions along the Abuja-Kaduna train routes was initially denied by officials of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), it is no longer news that a number of Abuja -bound passengers penultimate week were rattled after they got a dose of the nightmares usually experienced by victims of attacks on the Abuja-Kaduna highway in the past.\n\nThe incident, said to have occurred in the night, involved a train which was heading to Riggasa train station after taking off from the Idu station in Abuja around 8pm.\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that the passengers had barely settled down for the about one and a half hour journey when a loud bang suspected to be caused by an explosion device suddenly shut down the train engine. The bomb planted by suspected terrorists reportedly hit their train, forcing it to derail at a distance meters.\n\nImmediately after the explosion, the train air-conditioning and lights were put off. This was reported followed by a rain of bullets which shattered the driver\u2019s windscreen, just as the police escorts, who were outnumbered, could only provide little resistance.\n\nNRC\u2019s explanations\n\nWhile confirming the attack, the managing director of the NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, said the explosives damaged the rail tracks somewhere between Dutse and Rijana, in the Kaduna section of the corridor.\n\n\u201cYes, there was an explosive on our rail track somewhere around Rijana and Dutse last night, and this damaged the tracks. He however confirmed to newsmen that efforts are currently ongoing to ensure that the train services along the Kaduna-Abuja route are fully restored. Okhiria nevertheless denied reports making the rounds that gunshots were aimed at the train driver. According to him, \u201cThere was nothing like that; it was only an explosive that went up on the track.\u201d\n\nAlso confirming the incident, one of the passengers, a former lawmaker who represented Kaduna South, Senator Shehu Sani, was quoted as saying that the bandits did not only attack, they also planted an explosive that damaged the rail track and shattered the windshield of the train engine. \u201cThe train nearly skidded off its track, and then we miraculously escaped,\u201d he said.\n\nSani said further that they equally opened fire, targeting the driver, and the tank around Dutse and Rijana stations.\n\nNo one ever had any premonition that the railway transportation could as well be a target by bandits when the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was flagging off the project, but the unthinkable happened.\n\nWhile carrying out the commissioning some years back, the President noted that the project would impact on the lives of the Abuja residents as well as Kaduna state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted to be here today to commission the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway track and flag-off the Abuja-Kaduna train services (Passengers & Freight) on Nigeria\u2019s first ever Standard Gauge Rail track to go into operation. This project was conceived by a previous administration, started by the last government and I am pleased to complete and commission it.\n\n\u201cIt is our vision and hopes that those good old days will soon be back with us and indeed in a more prosperous way with the restoration of the rail transport system which today\u2019s occasion symbolises.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the Abuja-Kaduna Standard Gauge rail track commenced in 2009 and happily, sixteen years after, we are on the threshold of presenting to Nigerians a Standard Gauge Railway Train Service that will be safe, fast and reliable.\n\n\u201cI wish to also reassure Nigerians that due attention will be placed on pursuing the 25-Year Strategic Railway Master Plan which is aimed at rehabilitating the existing 3,505km narrow gauge rail line and developing and constructing new standard gauge rail lines across the country.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the symbolic return of rail service today I wish to reiterate the commitment of this Administration to pursue with greater vigour and determination rehabilitation and construction of other rail lines including the major Lagos-Calabar and Kano-Lagos lines. As we get down to work, I look forward to flagging off many more lines outlined in our transport policy programme.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing his experience, a commuter, Shuaib Gidado, told this reporter that despite the unfortunate incident, he would still stick to the railway means of transportation.\n\nAccording to him, the railway transportation, especially the new Abuja-Kaduna route, remains one of the best things that have happened to commuters plying the Abuja-Kaduna road and who now see it as their best alternative.\n\n\u201cConsidering nasty experiences on the Kaduna road where people again lost their lives recently, I still think it\u2019s the best and I will still ply it. Insecurity, explosion though becoming something else especially the explosion incident of last month, I hope something would be done to allay commuters fears,\u201d Gidado said.\n\nLikewise, another commuter who plies the Abuja-Kaduna road on a regular basis, Engr. Olabiyi Teniola, expressed concerns over the attacks and urged the government to ensure passengers\u2019 safety on the route. He also called the various security agencies to scale up their surveillance to stem the scourge.\n\n\u201cWe no longer feel safe. These bandits are becoming more daring. We can only hope and pray that the authorities would be proactive and checkmate activities of these people before they overrun Abuja.\n\n\u201cIs it that Nigerians are now at the mercy of these blood-thirsty gunmen? It is high time our government took the bull by the horns so that what happened some years back when bombers invaded Abuja will not repeat itself,\u201d Teniola said.\n\nFG\u2019s assurances\n\nBut allaying commuters fears after the incident, the federal government pledged its readiness to do the needful in order to protect the citizens.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, gave the assurance during his visit to the site. According to him, the federal government was going to procure digital security system for regular monitoring of railway corridors to avert another incident track bombing.\n\nHe added that the government would in next to no time approve the installation of a digital security system to address future challenges of breach of security.\n\n\u201cWhat is significant is that the work was done by Nigerians in record time and by tomorrow (Saturday), we expect to run the first train.\n\n\u201cApart from this (Wednesday explosion), there has not been any security challenge before now. What this has done to us will fasten the procurement of the digital security system that we are trying to put in place. We took it to the cabinet two weeks ago, and it was returned. We will take it again to ensure we get approval so we can install it.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the security system is to enable us to know if there is an impact on the censor. We will try to get the police involved before we install the security system.\n\n\u201cI may not be happy that the security breach took place but what we have been able to show is that we actually have the capacity to fix our rail. The essence of this is that by the time we leave, we should start getting people who can construct our railways. What they (local engineers) have shown is that if they can fix this, they should be able to construct some kilometres of rail. But we have to test them gradually,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "For the umpteenth time, President Muhammadu Buhari has given marching orders to the security chiefs to go after insurgents, bandits and terrorists, saying they must not rest until all Nigerians are at rest.\n\nThe president also expressed happiness over the free and fair gubernatorial election held in Anambra and the roles played by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and reassured that nothing would threaten the 2023 general elections.\n\nMinister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola stated this Thursday while briefing journalists at the end of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by the president at the Presidential Villa Abuja.\n\nAregbesola said President Buhari appreciated the successes and gains recorded by all security chiefs, the security agencies and intelligence organisations on security situation nationwide after he received briefs from them at the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe (Buhari) is of the belief that more must and should still be done. But he commended all of them for the progress we are recording on all fronts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further stated that the president ordered the armed forces and other security agencies, intelligence organisations, not to rest on their oars, notwithstanding the progress and efforts being made to eliminate insurgency, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and all the other criminalities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president said that we are not yet where we should be. That Nigerians deserve to live in peace. And that until we achieved that we will not rest.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said the president was particularly pleased with the outcome of the November 6 governorship elections that produced former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Professor Charles Soludo, as the Anambra governor-elect.\n\n\u201cThe President was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd that that is a good assurance to all Nigerians, that we are committed to promoting democracy, that is in respect of Anambra election.\n\n\u201cAnd he was quite happy that the combination of INEC and the security agencies, from the military to the police and all the other agencies made that possible with the support of the people and the government of Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe all saw the outcome. With that there is no doubt as to the commitment of our administration to promoting democracy, and ensuring that 2023 is not in any way threatened,\u201d Aregbesola said.\n\nINTERPOL\n\nHe said Buhari was also particularly happy with the news that the Head of INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Garba Umar, has been elected Vice President (Africa) and Executive Committee Member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\n\nAsked if the resurgence of criminal activities along Abuja-Kaduna highways was discussed at the meeting, Aregbesola said: \u201cOh, yes. The police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not only about Abuja-Kaduna. Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically, but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity.\n\n\u201cSo, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order, have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police will be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security.\n\n\u201cSo whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nAlso asked if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country was discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe council, today, took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces today (Thursday), there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategies to that effect, especially as it was not the first time such charge would be given by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible.\n\n\u201cSo, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organisations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nRoll call\n\nPresent at the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Chief of Staff to the President Professor Ibrahim Gambari; National Security Adviser (NSA) -ajor General Babagana Monguno (retd) and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General LEO Irabor.\n\nAlso in attendance were Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff as well as the Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali.\n\nBefore the commencement of the meeting, President Buhari, with the assistance of Vice President Osinbajo, had decorated his Aide De Camp (ADC) Lt.-Col Yusuf Mukhtar Dodo with his new red neck rank of Colonel.\n\nTroops kill 30 terrorists\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east have killed over 90 Boko Haram/ Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists and arrested 21 others.\n\nThe military also said a total of 996 terrorists and their families comprising 203 males, 302 females and 491 children surrendered to troops at different locations in Borno state.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on update of military operations across the country from 11 to 25.\n\nHe said troops also arrested a notorious terrorist named Mr Haladu Saleh, who had been on wanted list since 2018.\n\nHe said \u201cIn the course of these operations, no fewer than 90 terrorists were neutralized and 21 of them arrested.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although a few setbacks were experienced in the course of these operations within the last 2 weeks, however, troops remained undaunted and determined in their quest to attain sustainable peace in the country through kinetic and non-kinetic operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops of Operation HADIN KAI within the period under review carried out extensive land and air operations across the theatre.\n\n\u201cNotably, on 12 November, 2021, the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI decimated BHT/ISWAP terrorist elements in offensive air strikes in a location within Baga near the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 13 November, 2021, own troops in a coordinated ground and air attacks, repelled terrorists\u2019 attack on troops at Askira Uba in Borno state. During the counter-offensive operation, over 50 of the terrorists were neutralized and several of their combat equipment, including gun trucks and other weapons were destroyed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said troops arrested Boko Haram logistics supplies and two drug peddlers named Mr Ezekiel Karson and Galadima Bako with large quantities of cannabis sativa.\n\nHe added that many kidnapped victims were freed and assorted weapons were seized from the terrorists.\n\n\u201cAlso, 98 assorted weapons, including AK-47 rifles and 2,589 rounds of ammunitions were recovered within the period. Additionally, seven kidnapped civilians were rescued.\n\n\u201cTheir fighting vehicles as well as large caches of arms and ammunition were recovered during the encounter. However, some of our gallant officers and soldiers paid the supreme prize,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika has said the country\u2019s national air carrier, Air Nigeria, is expected to take off April 2022.\n\nThe minister said this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the national airliner would be run by a company in which the Nigerian government would hold a five percent stake, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 percent and the remaining 49 percent for yet to be assigned strategic equity partners, including foreign investors.\n\nSitrika said, when it becomes operational, the national carrier would create about 70,000 jobs for Nigerians.\n\nThe minister said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name unveiled 2018.\n\n\u201cToday in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport.\n\n\u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, including follow-ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in Europe because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform. It\u2019s extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik is the creator of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1, 492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and a completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; the government will be owning not more than 5%. So, 5 per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%.\u201d\n\nSirika added that with a 51 per cent share, Nigerians will own the majority while 49% will be held by strategic equity partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so; I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to the integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market.\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the target is \u201cdoable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 so, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigerian Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to the national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website; you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "The deputy head of Sudan\u2019s governing sovereign council, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has said that Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was aware of last month\u2019s military takeover before it happened and was \u201ccompletely agreeable\u201d to it.\n\nHamdok was deposed by the military on October 25 but reinstated as interim premier after signing a deal on Sunday with Sudan\u2019s top general to restore the transition to civilian rule.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on October 25 was the ultimate outcome of a long process. Many discussions were made, and many initiatives proposed,\u201d Dagalo, also known as Hemeti, told Al Jazeera in an exclusive interview released on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister himself proposed two initiatives during the meetings. We were left with three options, the best of which was the move we took, and it was completely agreeable to the prime minister himself,\u201d said Dagalo. \u201cWe did not make such a move on our own.\u201d\n\nDagalo said the military takeover was \u201cthe best option to stop what was becoming a spiralling crisis\u201d.\n\nReporting from Khartoum, Al Jazeera\u2019s Resul Serdar said that Dagalo\u2019s claims about Hamdok were \u201cbold\u201d allegations since many Sudanese people have been asking whether he was part of the military takeover or had been aware it would happen.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked him, he said he didn\u2019t know that the military coup was coming,\u201d said Atas, referring to a recent interview with the prime minister after he was reinstated this week.\n\n\u201cNow the deputy chairman says they had actually discussed it with Hamdok and he knew of the military takeover before it took place,\u201d said Atas.\n\n\u201cPeople were already questioning his independence. After this allegation, people will question his legitimacy even more,\u201d he added.\n\nOn October 25, top General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan dissolved the government, arrested the civilian leadership, and declared a state of emergency \u2013 drawing widespread international condemnation and triggering widespread anti-coup protests.\n\nHamdok was placed under house arrest after the military seized power.\n\nOn November 11, al-Burhan issued a decree creating a new 14-member ruling sovereign council, with himself at the head.\n\nThe coup, more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime strongman Omar al-Bashir, derailed a transition towards democratic elections and drew international criticism.\n\nThe 14-point deal between Hamdok and the military, signed in the presidential palace in Khartoum on Sunday, provided for the release of all political prisoners detained during the coup and stipulated that a 2019 constitutional declaration be the basis for a political transition, according to details read out on state television.\n\nFollowing the deal, the reinstated premier told Al Jazeera that he would form a \u201ctechnocratic government\u201d made up of qualified professionals to lead the country to elections by June 2023.\n\nThe deal was largely welcomed by the international community, but Sudanese pro-democracy activists have rejected it as an \u201cattempt to legitimise the coup\u201d.\n\nThey demand that the military should not be part of any future Sudanese government and Sudanese people have continued to protest against the military\u2019s involvement in politics since the agreement was signed.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of people have been back to the streets, insisting on their demands,\u201d said Serdar, who added that the formation of a new cabinet and the release of political prisoners are the two main issues yet to be resolved.\n\nTwelve cabinet ministers also submitted their resignation to Hamdok in protest against the deal between the prime minister and the military.\n\nAt least 41 people have been killed during confrontations with security forces since the coup, as security forces have at times used live rounds to disperse anti-coup demonstrators.",

          "text": "A slew of nations moved to stop air travel from southern Africa on Friday, and stocks plunged in Asia and Europe in reaction to news of a new, potentially more transmissible COVID-19 variant.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we need is to bring in a new variant that will cause even more problems,\u201d said German Health Minister Jens Spahn, amid a massive spike in cases in the 27-nation European Union.\n\nWithin a few days of the discovery of the new variant, it has already impacted on a jittery society that is sensitive to bad COVID-19 news, with deaths around the globe standing at well over 5 million.\n\nThere are fears that the new variant could be even more contagious than the current predominant one and could bypass the effectiveness of the vaccination campaigns.\n\n\u201cEarly indications show this variant may be more transmissable than the delta variant and current vaccines may be less effective against it,\u201d British Health Secretary Sajid Javid told lawmakers. \u201cWe must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael, one of the world\u2019s most vaccinated countries, announced Friday that it has detected the country\u2019s first case of the new variant in a traveler who returned from Malawi. The traveler and two other suspected cases have been placed in isolation. It said all three are vaccinated but that it is currently looking into their exact vaccination status.\n\nThe new variant immediately infected stock markets around the world. Major indexes fell in Europe and Asia and Dow Jones futures dipped 800 points ahead of the market opening in the U.S.\n\n\u201cInvestors are likely to shoot first and ask questions later until more is known,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley of foreign exchange broker Oanda.\n\nOil prices plunged, with US. crude off 6.7% at $73.22 per barrel and the international Brent benchmark off 5.6% at $77.64, both unusually large moves for a single day. The pandemic caused oil prices to plunge during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 because travel restrictions reduced demand for fuel.\n\nAirlines shares were hammered, with Lufthansa off 12.4%, IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, off 14.4%, Air France-KLM down 8.9% and easyJet falling 10.9%\n\nThe World Health Organization cautioned not to jump to conclusions too fast.\n\nSpeaking before the EU announcement, Dr. Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at the WHO said that \u201cit\u2019s really important that there are no knee-jerk responses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the past, the minute there\u2019s any kind of mention of any kind of variation and everyone is closing borders and restricting travel. It\u2019s really important that we remain open, and stay focused,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nIt quickly fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe U.K. announced that it was banning flights from South Africa and five other southern African countries effective at noon on Friday, and that anyone who had recently arrived from those countries would be asked to take a coronavirus test.\n\nGermany said its flight ban could be enacted as soon as Friday night. Spahn said airlines coming back from South Africa will only be able to transport German citizens home, and travelers will need to go into quarantine for 14 days whether they are vaccinated or not.\n\nGermany has seen new record daily case numbers in recent days and passed the mark of 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday.\n\nItaly\u2019s health ministry also announced measures to ban entry into Italy of anyone who has been in seven southern African nations \u2014 South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini \u2014 in the past 14 days due to the new variant. The Netherlands is planning similar measures.\n\nThe Japanese government announced that From Friday, Japanese nationals traveling from Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho will have to quarantine at government-dedicated accommodation for 10 days and do a COVID test on Day 3, Day 6 and Day 10. Japan has not yet opened up to foreign nationals.\n\nThe coronavirus evolves as it spreads and many new variants, including those with worrying mutations, often just die out. Scientists monitor for possible changes that could be more transmissible or deadly, but sorting out whether new variants will have a public health impact can take time.\n\nCurrently identified as B.1.1.529, the new variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong in travelers from South Africa, he said.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s technical working group is to meet Friday to assess the new variant and may decide whether to give it a name from the Greek alphabet. It says coronavirus infections jumped 11% in Europe in the past week, the only region in the world where COVID-19 continues to rise. The WHO\u2019s Europe director, Dr. Hans Kluge, warned that without urgent measures, the continent could see another 700,000 deaths by the spring.",

          "text": "A man claiming to be an associate of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has accused the head of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) of ignoring an email from her.\n\nDing Li tweeted a screenshot of mail he claims she wrote to WTA chief Steve Simon asking not to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d.\n\nMs Peng disappeared from public view after accusing former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe WTA has led a chorus of voices demanding proof of her safety.\n\nMs Peng, 35, who is one of China\u2019s top tennis players, had earlier this month written a 1,600-word post on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where she laid out her allegations against the 75-year-old Mr Zhang.\n\nThis is the most significant case of its kind in China\u2019s slow-moving #MeToo movement.\n\nLittle is known about Mr Ding, who claims he is friends with the tennis star. He is reportedly a senior executive of a company that organises sport events and manages athletes, and his relationship to her is also not clear.\n\nHe said Ms Peng had sent an email to Mr Simon, in which she said: \u201cAt the moment I do not want to be disturbed, and especially [can you] not hype up my personal affairs. I hope to live quietly. Thank you again for your concern.\u201d\n\nIn an email interview with the BBC, Mr Ding alleged that Mr Simon had received the emails but \u201cavoided\u201d her.\n\nHe also claimed Mr Simon had given her contact details to more than 10 tennis players as well as media outlets, causing her to be \u201cbothered\u201d by many phone calls.\n\nThis, he said, was \u201ca very big factor\u201d in why she was not talking to Mr Simon.\n\nThe BBC has approached the WTA for a response to Mr Ding\u2019s allegations.\n\nMr Ding added that she was in Beijing and had \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d. He claimed Ms Peng was under \u201cabsolutely no supervision nor pressure, and there was definitely no punishment\u201d.\n\nWhen the BBC asked to speak to her however, he said she declined as her life had already been \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d. Asked why she was not directly addressing the public, he said \u201cshe only wishes to have a good rest alone in her own home\u201d, reiterating a line carried in state media to justify her absence from public view.\n\nMany including the WTA and activist groups have expressed doubt about such claims.\n\nMr Ding added that the authorities were not investigating nor taking any action with regards to Ms Peng\u2019s accusations, as her alleged emails to WTA showed \u201cthere was no sexual assault\u201d. This is despite Ms Peng having explicitly stated she was forced to have sex with Zhang Gaoli.\n\nMr Simon has threatened to pull the WTA\u2019s business out of China, which would have a big effect. There are 10 WTA events scheduled to take place in the country next year including the Wuhan Open and WTA finals in Shenzhen.\n\nThe Wuhan Open next year will be the first time tennis players have returned to the city since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe UN and US have also demanded information on her whereabouts along with a number of major tennis players including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic.\n\nChina has reacted angrily to the attention, particularly after there was sceptical reaction to a series of photographs and videos that appeared to show all was well with the athlete.\n\nThe WTA said the recent videos \u201cdon\u2019t alleviate or address the WTA\u2019s concern about her wellbeing and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion\u201d.\n\nDays ago, China issued a statement saying \u201cpeople should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue.\u201d",

          "text": "France reacted with fury Friday to Britain\u2019s latest proposals for dealing with the deadly flow of migrants between their shores as the war of words between the two countries over the dangerous crossings across the English Channel ramped up further.\n\nIn a public letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson laid out a series of proposals of how the two countries can deal with the crisis, following the sinking of a boat on Wednesday that saw 27 people die.\n\nThe letter, which was made public on social media, was deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d by French government spokesman Gabriel Attal. As a result, he said Britain\u2019s Home Secretary Priti Patel was no longer welcome at a European meeting on Sunday to discuss the problem.\n\n\u201cWe are sick of double-speak,\u201d Attal said.\n\nAmong his recommendations, Johnson asked that France take back all migrants who cross illegally from its shores to Britain.\n\nAttal dismissed the idea as \u201cclearly not what we need to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nHe said the letter \u201cdoesn\u2019t correspond at all\u201d with discussions that Johnson and Macron had Wednesday after the tragedy.\n\nJohnson also set out proposals for British border officials to begin patrols on the beaches of northern France as early as next week \u2014 something Paris has long resisted. He also recommended joint or reciprocal maritime patrols in each other\u2019s territorial waters and airborne surveillance by manned flights and drones.\n\nBritish Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Johnson had made the proposals in \u201cgood faith\u201d and urged the French to reconsider their decision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything inflammatory to ask for close co-operation with our nearest neighbours,\u201d he told BBC radio. \u201cThe proposal was made in good faith. I can assure our French friends of that and I hope that they will reconsider meeting up to discuss it.\u201d\n\nThe French move marks a sharp deterioration in relations between the two countries which have for weeks become increasingly strained by the migrant crisis in the Channel.\n\nU.K. officials have criticized France for rejecting their offer of British police and border officers to conduct joint patrols along the channel coast with French police. French authorities say Britain is stoking the crisis because it is too easy for migrants to remain in the country and\n\nwork if they manage to cross the channel.\n\nMore than 23,000 people have already entered the U.K. on small boats this year, up from 8,500 last year and just 300 in 2018, according to data compiled by Parliament.",
