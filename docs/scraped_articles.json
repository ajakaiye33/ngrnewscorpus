Abiola Peter Makinde has called for the immediate dualization of the Ore\u2013Ondo Federal road, in Ondo state.\n\nMakinde moved the motion at the green chamber following the sorry state of the road and the delay in its dualization by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing.\n\nThe Rep member who doubles as the Deputy Chairman, House Committee on Federal Character said that the Ore-Ondo city federal road is connected to over five Federal Constituencies and many other towns in Ondo, Edo, and Osun States.\n\nAccording to him\u201d the road has been earmarked for dualisation by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing some years ago.\n\nMakinde in a statement signed by him and made available to newsmen in Akure said that \u201cThe road is a major route for conveying agricultural produce to Ondo from adjoining states and is strategic for ease of movement of motorists and cargoes from northern Nigeria to the Southwest.\n\nHe lamented that despite being earmarked by the Ministry of Works and housing long ago for dualization, the contract for dualization of the road was yet to be awarded\n\nMakinde said he was concerned that \u201cthe deplorable state of the busy road, which has been neglected for years, has been worsened by the influx of heavy-duty trucks conveying goods from the northern part of the country to the Southwest.\n\n\u201d The devastating condition of the road has adversely affected the means of livelihood of people living in the six surrounding local government areas.\n\n\u201cDue to the deplorable state of the road, it has become a haven for kidnappers and armed robbers who continue to take advantage to attack commuters and terrorize unsuspecting citizens as security agents are unable to respond promptly and come to their rescue\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poor condition of the road has turned the highway into a death trap, as travellers meet their untimely death through accidents, especially along the Ore-Ondo axis of the highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reoccurring fatal accidents on the road is mostly as a result of its narrowness, and therefore requires dualization, considering that it is a busy and major link to many states of the federation\u201d He added.\n\nMakinde, therefore, moved that the House should urge the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to commence the dualization of Ore-Ondo-Akure road, given that it has been earlier earmarked for that purpose.\n\nHe further moved that the House mandates the Committee on Works to ensure compliance.\n\nThe speaker, Rt.

In his desperate effort to deny the obvious, Afunanya stated that our Client is allowed the opportunity of daily changing of his clothes. This is a blatant falsehood!\u201d\n\nEjiofor stated that Nigerians can attest that Kanu has been wearing the Fendi outfit he wore during his rearrest in Kenya.\n\n\u201cThe Fendi cloth he was putting on at the time he was abducted in Kenya is the only cloth he has severally worn to court, the general public can attest to this fact.

Not so, this contribution from the Wise One of Ila-Orangun.\n\n\u201cIf there is any sizzling, it is simply the fire of truth\u2019s passion that leaps at the reader from between the covers. Akande\u2019s fire prurifies, being a flame of illumination carried over from real life to brighten the pages of saga of service to Nigerian humanity.\u201d\n\nAside Soyinka, Ambassador Dapo Fafowora also observed that the revelations in the scripts might provoke litigations.\n\n\u201cHe quickly constituted a committee of our children: Oluwafemi Akande, Esq., Oyewole Akande, Esq, and Ayobamidele Akande, Esq who are lawyers to have a second look at my presentation of facts,\u201d Akande wrote in the preface.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmong many revelations, Akande claimed that the nonagenarian Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s Lekki home was built for him by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He also said President Muhammadu Buhari reneged on his promise to make Tinubu his running mate in 2015.\n\nHe also had harsh words for former President Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Deputy Governor Iyiola Omisore. He added that N-PDP members snatched the leadership of the National Assembly in 2015.\n\nThe author also revealed how former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was nearly stopped from joining the then fledging APC by his former colleagues in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had decided to team up with the new party in 2012 ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\n\u201cWhen the party (APC) was ready and we were going around to all the leaders, someone reminded us that we had not seen Obasanjo and Babangida and asked them to join us.\n\n\u201cWe also decided to extend the same courtesy to Atiku Abubakar, being a former vice president. But we were a bit reluctant about Atiku because he was being avoided by the new-PDP.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we decided to meet him. The team met him in Abuja. He did not make any demand on us. He participated actively in all the congresses and tried to help the APC grow in his area.\n\n\u201cWe wooed all the leaders of the new-PDP and visited all of them. They told us they needed to hold a meeting and take a decision.\n\n\u201cNyako of Adamawa told us at a stage that he would leave them behind and join us on his own.\n\n\u201cSome of them felt they were being stampeded.\n\n\u201cOne morning, Tinubu and I were in Abuja and we learnt that the leaders of the new-PDP were meeting at the Kano House, Asokoro, which was not far from where we were staying.\n\n\u201cWe decided to join them. We phoned Buhari to join us too. Ogbonnaya Onu joined us too.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, it became a joint meeting between the APC and the new-PDP. It was a day of our National Executive Committee meeting and all our people were waiting for me at the APC national headquarters.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Kano House, the New-PDP leaders had prepared a document listing conditions under which they would accept to join us. They gave us a copy. Tinubu read it and said all these were unnecessary.\n\n\u201cHe reduced the two-page paper to one page of about three sentences. After some discussion, it was agreeable to both sides.

It appeared they trusted each other,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe added that Buhari offered Tinubu the running mate slot in 2014 even when he had not secured the party\u2019s ticket. He explained that this was done in the presence of Governor Aminu Bello Masari.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u2019 I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate.\u201d\n\nAkande said after the primaries Buhari insisted on Tinubu but other interests started coming up, adding that Admas Oshiomhole\u2019s position was that Buhari should be allowed to choose his running mate.\n\nHe said at a point Buhari asked for three names from which he would choose from.\n\n\u201cI was angry with him. \u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the North, including those who were Muslims.\n\n\u201cI told him the slot belonged to the Southwest and to the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership. \u2018That is the burden the North has brought to national politics!\u2019 He did not like my remark but kept quiet about it.\u201d\n\nAkande said ex-Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole and ex-Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola came into the venue of the meeting and Oshiomhole said it would be unfair to renege on the agreement.\n\n\u201cBuhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe said Tinubu became angry with Buhari and refused to join a discussion on the running mate initiated by Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore. Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own,\u201d Akande quoted Tinubu to have said.\n\nAkande later discussed with Tinubu on phone and he mentioned Prof. Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s name as the one suggested to Buhari during the 2011 race.

          "text": "*\u2019Jonathan not sincere with National Conference\u2019\n\n*\u2019Adebanjo knows he lacks what it takes to aspire for high political positions\u2019\n\nEx-All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Chief Bisi Akande has said the party did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its 2015 manifesto.\n\nHe said the Goodluck Jonathan administration was not sincere with the National Conference.\n\nAkande, in his autobiography, \u2018My Participations\u2019, also accused Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the late Sir Olaniwun Ajayi and Chief Olu Falae, who participated in the conference, of thwarting the efforts of the progressives in the Southwest.\n\nHe said Adebanjo \u201crecognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the national Chairman of the ACN, my first letter to President Jonathan in June 2011 was to begin the restructuring of the Nigerian polity by simple devolution of the security management from the centre to the states.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI had also been invited to the Nigerian Senators\u2019 Retreat in Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State, in 2012, where I presented a paper on policing for security in a Federation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as the interim National Chairman of APC, I knew that I should quickly place the invitation on the Jonathan Conference before my party\u2019s interim National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cThe invitation was viewed as diversionary and convoluted and was, therefore, unanimously rejected by the party.\n\n\u201cIn spite of everything, Bola Tinubu and I, as Yoruba leaders within APC, deliberated with the governors of the South-West states and we agreed to sponsor delegates to the conference. It was not difficult for us to see, at that time, that President Goodluck Jonathan was not sincere about the representations to and about the outcome of the conference.\n\n\u201cSince it was not a Sovereign National Conference, it was sensible to know that whatever the resolutions of the conference, it would still have to be placed before the National Assembly for possible enactment into laws. President Jonathan truly and deliberately did not place the Conference\u2019s report and resolutions before the National Assembly throughout his years in power.\n\n\u201cFor him, the Conference was merely an instrument for political propaganda. It is sheer political illiteracy to think that the word, \u2018equitable\u2019 can be easily defined to convince those who might have had extra advantages under the military \u2013created order to surrender easily,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe went on: \u201cAPC did not have \u2018Restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of power from the centre to the states. While the President (whether Obasanjo, Yar\u2019Adua, Jonathan or Buhari) has the whole of Nigeria as his constituency, members of the National Assembly that have the powers to amend the Constitution imposed on Nigeria by the military represent constituencies individually from different ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting \u2018Restructuring\u2019 on the APC or its Presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on \u2018Restructuring\u2019, whatever it might connote.\u201d\n\nOn the Afenifere leaders\u2019 participation in the Jonathan conference, he wrote: \u201cI was not surprised that three old men who were virulently opposed to our aspirations in the APC found their ways into the Jonathan Conference.\n\n\u201cThese men \u2013 Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, Chief Ayo Adebano and Chief Olu Falae were once our leaders in the old Afenifere until the passage of Papa Adesanya. They could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent our interest.\n\n\u201cThey believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the Conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics. The old Afenifere and PDP coalition was fronted by these three men and General Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cChief Adebanjo, the most vociferous of them, is a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party.\n\n\u201cAdebanjo detests all past governors produced by his party since the UPN days and proudly says so in his regular pontifications. I always passed him for a mere political agitator among the old local party paid canvassers euphemistically called \u2018organising secretaries\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe did not, however, allow the public posturing and grandstanding of these three men and their co-travellers to distract us.\n\n\u201cWe focused on our assignment of making the APC a formidable organisation so that it could fulfil its historic role of ending, once and for all, the 16-years misrule of the PDP.\u201d",

The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. When we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had.\u201d\n\nJavid said: \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK. Now that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\nCurrently, all UK arrivals from red list countries must pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel for 10 days.\n\nMeanwhile, Air Peace is to enjoy seven weekly frequencies into Dubai as against one weekly service to Sharjah.\n\nIn response to the travel ban, the Nigerian government had said it will restrict airlines coming from Canada, the UK, and Saudi Arabia from Tuesday. Minister of aviation, Hadi Sirika, said it was to reciprocate the travel ban placed on Nigeria over the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron.\n\nBut during a press briefing of the Presidential Task Force which took place in Abuja on Monday, Sirika said there were ongoing negotiations between both countries and that there are indications that the issue would be resolved soon.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

In fact, the PFN, which by the grace of God I head today, has a membership strength of over 65 millions adherents of Jesus Christ.

          "text": "Urges Buhari to sign Electoral Act Amendment Bill\n\nThe Chairman of THISDAY Group and ARISE News Channel, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, has advised the federal government to introduce security tax in order to effectively fund security agencies and curb the rising cases of insecurity in the country.\n\nIn addition, Obaigbena who spoke at the First Memorial Lecture to honour the late founding chairman of the Leadership Newspaper, Sam Nda-Isaiah, on Tuesday, also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law.\n\nSpeaking during a panel session on \u2018The Big Ideas,\u2019 he stressed that securing Nigerians was a key challenge facing the present government.\n\n\u201cSo, one way I believe is to have a security tax. We all pay taxes every day to secure ourselves. So, if we have a security tax that is managed by a trusteeship, they can have the equipment, then I think we can go somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, signing the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law was necessary to enthrone a sound electoral system where every vote counts.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a sound electoral process where every vote counts. So, I urge the minister of information and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to ensure that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is signed immediately and then we begin to look for leaders who will position our country for the next generations,\u201d he added.\n\nObaigbena also called for a national consensus to identify little ideas from big ideas and to begin to implement them, \u201cso as to put our houses in order to secure the lives and property, and educate people, provide water supply and other basic things.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe can also solve these problems by restructuring the way revenue is distributed so that the states don\u2019t come begging the federal government for one thing or the other.\u201d\n\nHe also paid tributes to, not only the late Sam Nda-Isaiah, but also to three other senior journalists who died recently \u2013 Samaila Isah Funtua, Wada Maida and the late chief of staff to the president, Abba Kyari.\n\nAlso speaking at the ceremony, the Chief Executive Officer, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Ahmed Kuru, said the late Sam Nda-Isaiah\u2019s political ambition was driven by his conviction that Nigeria\u2019s woes could easily be fixed.\n\nKuru, in his tribute during the lecture to honour Sam Nda-Isaiah, said he had never come across such a passionate person like Sam.\n\nKuru further remarked that Nda-Isaiah saw potential in every idea and pursued all initiatives and opportunities concurrently, thereby always running thin on resources.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, described the late Nda-Isaiah as a patriot who was interested in a united and peaceful Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was always patriotic and ready to help in affairs of the state. His dream was for a united and peaceful Nigeria. The late Sam Nda-Isaiah will be happy that he is remembered by those he called friends.\n\n\u201cSam was a brother, but above all, Sam was a patriot. He loved Nigeria and believed in possibility. He did not participate on the sidelines; he was one of the aspirants to fly the flag of the APC after the merger.\n\n\u201cHis passion for Nigeria never waned after losing the ticket to President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAccording to the information minister, the late Nda-Isaiah used his medium to constructively criticise government but also believed that government needed support.\n\n\u201cI admired his willingness to do anything for Nigeria. I miss him a lot because he was a standing board for me, \u201d he said.\n\nOn how government has met its campaign promises, he said it was rare for any aspirant to understand how bad a situation was unless he/she assumes office to face the stark reality.\n\nHe said the government had committed resources to fighting insecurity which would have been used to create jobs and provide infrastructure.\n\nOn his part, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the late media guru did not die in vain, as he impacted many lives positively.\n\nMustapha said the late pharmacist and politician touched lives, uplifted the down-trodden and provided comfort to those that had lost hope.\n\nDescribing Nda-Isaiah\u2019s death as a big loss to Nigeria, Mustapha said his life was one of service, passion, doggedness and living for country.\n\n\u201cSam\u2019s life was a clear and resounding message, subtle in its delivery and profound with its impact. A message of service, passion, commitment, loyalty, doggedness, love for country and legacy. Sam gave meaning to the age-old truism that it is not how long but how well we live our lives that matters,\u201d Mustapha who was chairman of the memorial event said yesterday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe lives he touched, the processes he changed, the down-trodden that he uplifted, the advice he gave for the good of the country and even the comfort he provided for those that have lost hope are already speaking for him,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn her address, the wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, yesterday described the late Nda-Isaiah as a personality that will be forever remembered by every Nigerian.\n\nThe First Lady said Nigerians would remember him, not only because they loved him, but also because of how he lived his life and the many ways he impacted people\u2019s lives positively.\n\nAccording to her, the late Nda-Isaiah may be many things to different people: a political columnist, a politician, pharmacist, journalist and founder and chairman of LEADERSHIP Group Ltd, but to his family, he was a loving husband; and she and the first family, he was an associate who they called \u2018my President\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe converge here to remember Sam who left us a year ago. We remember him today as we have done since he left and we will remember him tomorrow and for the rest of our lives.\n\n\u201cOver the course of his life, Sam ventured into diverse fields for as wide as his imaginations could take him. He was a true definition of a serial entrepreneur, but all that he ventured in were geared towards building and developing our nation and as a service to humanity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo Zainab, you have been very strong since Sam\u2019s departure, please remain strong. The children, the family, his business empire, and the rest of us need you more than ever because your strength and visibility give us a sense of Sam\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cWe will surely miss you, Sam, and but we take comfort that you have lived a good and memorable life. I pray that your soul may continue to rest in peace,\u201d Aisha Buhari added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I don\u2019t want to distract him from all the challenges he might face today. So, don\u2019t muddle the political waters. Consult, make our programme known to the people later. And the intention is clear. So, you can keep guessing.\u201d\n\nLeader of the group, Mr. Lawal Munir, while endorsing Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition, also revealed that the meeting resolved to work towards the actualisation of his ambition in 2023 due to his superlative qualities.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe meeting ended very well. We are working for him. We are working for him because we know he will win the election when the time comes.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that the former Lagos governor has not formally declared his intention to run, one of his mobilisation machines, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), has already commenced mobilisation of party faithful across the country in order to ensure his 2023 presidential ambition comes to fruition.\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had in October inaugurated the South West Agenda 2023 (SWAGA \u201923), a political movement that has been mobilising support for Tinubu to throw his hat in the 2023 presidential ring.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Govt targets N4.6trn borrowing next year\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nand Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt rose by N2.54 trillion, from N35.465 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2021, to N38.005 trillion ($92.626 billion) at the end of the third quarter.\n\nStatistics released by the Debt Management Office (DMO) indicated that the debt comprised total external and domestic debts of the federal government, 36 state governments, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe DMO explained that the increase of N2.540 trillion, when compared to the corresponding figure of N35.465 trillion at the end of Q2 2021, largely accounted for by the $4 billion Eurobonds issued by the federal government in September.\n\nThe debt management agency stated that the issuance of the $4 billion Eurobonds brought significant benefits to the economy by increasing the level of Nigeria\u2019s external reserves, thereby supporting the exchange rate of the naira, and providing necessary capital to enable the federal government finance various projects in the budget.\n\nThe triple-tranche $4 billion Eurobond, issued in September, was for the implementation of the New External Borrowing of $6.18 billion in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nMeanwhile, Director General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, yesterday said the federal government would reduce local borrowing next year, with the expectation of increased internal revenue. Oniha also disclosed that in 2021, the federal government borrowed a total of N5.134 trillion from the local debt market and targeted borrowing for 2022 was N4.6 trillion.\n\nShe made the assertions while speaking at a webinar organised by Coronation Merchant Bank, in partnership with the DMO, where she spoke on \u201cNigeria moving beyond COVID-19: Opportunities for Investors.\u201d\n\nOniha said while the country\u2019s treasury bills\u2019 obligations seemed to be rising in recent times, the debt office had been able to reduce its share of the local debt portfolio to less than 25 per cent. She said the share of treasury bills currently in the local debt basket was around 21 per cent.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe have done better than keeping TBills at 25 per cent. We actually came down to 21 per cent from that in terms of total domestic debt because we wanted to reduce the re-financing risk.\n\n\u201cEven with the increase we are still below 25 per cent maximum in terms of total domestic debt. The target is not to go up. We just kept it there because there are other transactions, such as promissory notes that we are issuing that will increase the short-term component.\n\n\u201cWhat is driving the additional issuance of TBills is because the new borrowing levels are extremely high. Last year, it was N4.6 trillion, while the initial budget was about N1.7 trillion. All of that couldn\u2019t have come from bonds only at decent rate, so some of it is being taken from TBills usually at the long end.\n\n\u201cIf you see the auction results you see that we are more at the 360-day tenure. It is true we are issuing more TBills, but more like new borrowings to fund the budget.

          "text": "\u2022To enforce pre-departure tests, other safety measures\n\nChinedu Eze\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) has removed the travel restrictions placed on Nigeria and 10 other countries due to the Omicron COVID-19 variant. The British High Commission announced this yesterday.\n\nThe UK diplomatic mission said all 11 countries, including Nigeria, were removed from the COVID-19 red list from today.\n\nThe travel restrictions on Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswantini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe had provoked global outrage.\n\nThe scrapping of the red list was disclosed in a statement signed by the High Commission. It, however, stated that pre-departure tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing measures on or before day two after arrival remained in place, with a planned review of all travel measures in the New Year.\n\nThe British High Commission said in the statement, \u201cFollowing review of the latest risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Nigeria and the other 10 countries and territories on the red list will be removed from 4am Wednesday, 15 December.\n\n\u201cPassengers arriving from Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe will not have to stay in a managed quarantine hotel on arrival in England from this date.\u201d\n\nIt noted that as Omicron cases rose in the UK and in countries around the world, \u201cthe travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of the variant from abroad and these temporary measures are no longer proportionate.\n\n\u201cThe red list has successfully served its purpose in delaying the spread of Omicron into the UK to buy time for scientists to learn more about this variant.\u201d\n\nBut the High Commission stressed that all vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must continue to take a pre-departure test two days or less before they depart for the UK and must take a PCR test on or before day two and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. It stated that these testing measures were vital in helping to prevent any additional cases of Omicron from entering the UK and stopping people from passing it on to others.\n\nThe UK mission also observed that the present situation was a critical phase in tackling the Omicron variant, saying the government\u2019s focus remains slowing the spread of the variant in the UK through maintenance of testing requirements at the border, introduction of Plan B measures, and turbocharging the booster rollout.\n\nBritish High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, was also quoted as saying, \u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world, the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility.\n\n\u201cWhen we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had.\u201d\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid also said, \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK.\n\n\u201cNow that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\n\u201cWith cases doubling every two to three days, we\u2019ve turbocharged our booster programme, we\u2019re asking arrivals to keep testing to limit the spread of new cases, and we are introducing Plan B measures to protect the country from the threat of this new variant.\u201d\n\nThe High Commission noted that while all countries had now been removed from the red list, the managed quarantine hotel policy remained in place to act as a crucial line of defence against the importation of variants of concern.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cRestrictions will be re-imposed should there be a need to do so to protect public health. Airlines will continue to check all passengers for pre-departure tests alongside their completed passenger locator form, and passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\n\u201cThe government will take further action if necessary to contain the virus and the new variant, as has been the case throughout the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe UKHSA continues to monitor the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world, and the government is working collaboratively with the World Health Organisation and countries around the world to better understand the new variant.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the development, the CEO of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, Tim Alderslade, said removing the countries from the red list made complete sense, \u201cbut doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough.\u201d\n\nAlderslade explained, \u201cIf the red list isn\u2019t necessary given that Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe. It is testing that is the deterrent to travel, not the relatively limited red list.\n\n\u201cGovernment has admitted that the measures introduced are disastrous for the travel sector, and the science says they aren\u2019t now required.\n\n\u201cThe Health Secretary says he wants to act quickly to remove unnecessary restrictions, and we implore him to make good on this by scrapping testing as soon as possible, otherwise the key Christmas and New Year booking period will be undermined. \u201cThis is make or break for UK aviation and if government is unable to row back from these restrictions over the New Year, it will need to step in with further economic support for a sector that again has been singled out.\u201d\n\nMany world leaders and organisations had expressed outrage at the restriction on travels from Nigeria and the other countries.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev. Justin Welby, condemned UK\u2019s inclusion of Nigeria in its COVID-19 red list without justification, calling it \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d, and suing for its cancellation.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, also described the action of the UK government as travel apartheid targeted at poor nations.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the variant, and could potentially discourage countries from reporting and sharing important data on coronavirus.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had described the decision of the UK government targeting Nigerian travellers as discriminatory, unfair, punitive, indefensible, and unjust.\n\nNigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Tunji Isola, who went on a media round in UK, had also criticised the move and said what was expected on the matter was a global approach to halt the spread of the disease and not selective punishment.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Senate had insisted that the travel ban was discriminatory, describing it as an attack on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and the UK. It called on the British government to reverse it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "1da Banton\u2019s \u201cNo Wahala\u201d blew up on Tik Tok. Now he knows its power",
          "text": "A few months ago, Nigerian artiste, 1da Banton, logged into his TikTok account, which he rarely used, only to discover that one of his songs, \u201cNo wahala\u201d, from his Original Machine Vibe album, was being used in videos captioned in French. Because he doesn\u2019t understand French, he Google-translated the captions, then smiled at himself.\n\nThe Afro dancehall artiste\u2019s song was being used in a TikTok challenge that would take his music straight to the ears of millions of fans around the world. Since the challenge began, \u201cNo wahala\u201d has been used as a soundtrack in more than 190,000 videos and was at some point the second most Shazamed song in the world. The song is also charting in over 10 countries, including the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Uganda, and Kenya.\n\nSpeaking on the inspiration for the song, on a video call with TechCabal, from his Lagos apartment, 1da Banton said he set out to create a stress-free vibe and connect with people who just wanted to live their lives without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhen I recorded \u2018No Wahala\u2019, that was how I was feeling, so I put it into music. When my producer, Blaise Beats, played the beat for me, the only thing that came to my head was to write a song that talks about a stress-free life, not a love or party song. I just wanted to make music people could relate to; that no matter the situation or circumstance, you just have to live your life. So, I\u2019m glad we achieved that.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Port-Harcourt, 1da Banton, dropped his debut single in 2015. Since his debut, he has released one EP and collaborated with Ghanaian Afro Dancehall superstar, Stonebwoy.\n\n\u201cNo wahala\u201d means no stress in Nigerian pidgin, a language widely spoken in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe song is featured in videos of afro-dances; reactions or replies to challenges or questions, sometimes from a loved one or crush. Some of the funniest videos under the challenge feature videos of Nigerian social media influencers, James Brown and Idris Okuneye (popularly known as Bobrisky), dancing, kicking a football, or in the gym.\n\n\u201cMy TikTok video on the \u2018No Wahala\u2019 challenge gave me my highest views and engagement on TikTok. I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Yewande Daranijo, an aspiring actress whose first viral TikTok video has over 300,000 views through this challenge.\n\n\u201cI jumped on the challenge, and boom it went viral. I was really excited, and I\u2019m glad I joined the challenge,\u201d said Daranijo who joined the app about seven months ago. Before the challenge, Daranijo did not know about 1da Banton, but now she knows him and believes he will get his due now that a lot of people know his song.\n\n1da Banton recalled that at the time his song was blowing up in France, he wasn\u2019t a regular user of Tik Tok and was still finding his way around the app.\n\n\u201cSo, \u2018No Wahala\u2019 doing so well on TikTok wasn\u2019t me; it was people. I just gave them the song. From now on, it would be a great idea to follow up on TikTok because of the influence it has on music today.\u201d\n\n1da Banton explained that all of his social media\u2014YouTube and Instagram\u2014is growing: \u201cEveryone is trying to check out who sang this amazing song, so all my numbers are going up.\u201d\n\nAnd as Nigerian artiste CKay did a few weeks ago, 1da Banton created a video on TikTok where he tried to claim ownership of the \u201cNo Wahala\u201d sound. He might have been successful with that, but his dance skills in the video were questionable, an assessment he agrees to and laughs about.\n\n\u201cUp until now, a lot of people still don\u2019t know that I am the owner of the song. It\u2019s a gradual process. I just had to make that video as a part of the process. I\u2019m not really a good dancer, but I still had to dance to the song. I needed them to understand that I am the original owner of the song.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, TikTok has taken at least three African songs to the global stage, and it is making Africans feel represented. Somali singer Nimco Happy\u2019s song, \u201cIsii Nafta\u201d, became an internet sensation, with celebrities like Cardi B, Trevor Noah, and Bella Hadid using the song in content. More than 100,000 videos have been created using the song. The viral song which switches between Swahili, English, Arabic, and Somali has left many Somalis celebrating the fact that their culture is in the global spotlight.\n\nCKay\u2019s \u201cLove Nwantiti\u201d also took over TikTok for weeks, earlier this year, with more than three million videos created using the song. As of September of this year, it was the most Shazamed song in the world and charting in 160 countries.\n\nTikTok\u2019s impact on music in Africa is growing and proving to be a massive support for artistes who may now create and strengthen the reach of their music beyond the continent, without a bank-breaking marketing campaign.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kwara raises a $4m seed to build Africa\u2019s first credit union-powered neobank",
          "text": "One of the beauties of fintech is its ability to either unbundle or seamlessly bundle fragmented and broken banking services. While some startups focus on building digital consumer banks, others focus on building banks for businesses, or for both.\n\nOne startup building for both is Kenya-based Kwara, a one-stop-shop core digital banking infrastructure for Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCOs) to manage all their activities, and it has raised $4 million seed funding.\n\nThe new investment will be used to facilitate the launching of its neobank; further develop its existing app; double down on its marketing efforts; and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe investment was led by Breega, with participation from SoftBank Vision Fund, Emerge, FINCA Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest, Do Good Invest, Raba Capital, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity, and fintech angels.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile many people think that SACCOs are a slow, vulnerable, and outdated way of saving and accessing credit, and that the market needs new agile products that could displace this model, Kwara, founded by Cynthis Wandia (CEO) and David Hwan (CTO), wants to keep it going by enhancing its efficiency through digitising all its core functionalities.\n\nA true cooperative guardian angel\n\nWendia had just rounded up her first startup and joined Finparx, a venture builder in Germany, to work as a venture developer; there she spent most of her days staring eye-to-eye at different problems. But what struck her the most was the problem of coffee farmers not getting much value for their hard work. Wendia\u2019s grandmother was a coffee farmer in Kenya so this was nostalgic.\n\nShe became curious and started digging. Her interest started off from a trade finance angle, looking at the supply chain, to see if there was something that could be done. But the more she looked at the value chain, starting from the farmer\u2019s point of view to export, she kept coming across this institution called the credit union or the cooperative, which is effectively like a financial institution or bank, but owned by its clients.\n\n\u201cI noticed, for example, that for my grandmother, the cooperative had walked with her on her entire economic journey. The more I looked into it, the more we saw just how incredible this institution is in offering extremely affordable financial products like savings, loans and pension,\u201d Wendia told TechCabal.\n\nSo, after further research on SACCOs in Kenya and across the world, Wendia and her team realised that these cooperatives are a sort of informal bank, \u201cthe fairest bank\u201d, in Wendia\u2019s words. But they saw how far behind they were in leveraging technology that could take their efficiency from zero to 100. \u201cSo, we launched Kwara as a technology infrastructure for SACCOs,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nIn 2019, the Kwara core banking product was launched and, ever since, has become a safe haven for Kenyan cooperatives. But the ambition has expanded from just being a banking infrastructure to becoming an operating system for every growth-oriented SACCO in Kenya.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nAccording to Wendia, the platform now powers over 50 cooperatives, with over 65,000 backend users. The company is reportedly growing its credit union customer base by 40% month-on-month, and the listed credit unions are growing their membership by 19% and their loan base by 46%, annually. There are currently more than $142 million assets under management at a $40 million monthly transaction across savings, loan disbursement, pension and lots more.\n\nBecause Kenya is a big market for cooperatives, the company is going through a product expansion as opposed to market expansion. Though it\u2019s reported to be courting some credit union clients in South Africa and the Philippines, which, according to the CEO, validates their solution across multiple markets. The company wants to focus on eliminating the existing frictions in the Kenyan market, a move that will somewhat guarantee seamless replication across other markets.\n\nFor instance, in a bid to become an operating system for SACCO, it has partnered with Workpay, a human resource management and payroll processing solutions company, to enable SACCOs automate their human resource (HR) processes as a complimentary service to Kwara\u2019s products. Onboarded SACCOs will be able to carry out seamless payroll processing into SACCO accounts and enjoy access to an HR module for efficient management of their staff.\n\n\u201cWe have also partnered with Lami insurance API provider, which plugs us into about 20 underwriters in Kenya. Now, our customers [SACCOs] can negotiate or choose fantastic insurance products right from our platform,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Kwara?\n\nThere are over 300 million people currently banking within emerging markets, and that number is growing at 6% year-on-year. Kwara aims to increase that to at least 1 billion by the end of the decade, positioning itself as the platform for $500bn in transactions between credit unions and their members.\n\nDue to that, it\u2019s launching a new bank that will be powered by its existing credit unions. The play here is to turn over 65,000 backend users into early users of its neobank while onboarding more credit unions to ramp up more users.\n\nThe neobank will allow members of credit unions to deposit money directly to their credit union accounts, repay their loans, and apply for instant loans while tracking their finances and payments, all in a seamless manner. In addition, Kwara is building an open banking infrastructure via an open API that allows credit unions to integrate with payment gateways, banks, and third-party vendors, enabling a full marketplace. Also, any unbanked individual can easily join a credit union and then enjoy the whole banking benefits.\n\nSpeaking on launching a neobank and on the investment that will make it possible. Kwara CEO, Cynthia Wandia, says, \u201cWe are building a solution for people\u2014an estimated 1 billion\u2014who do not currently have access to personalised banking services. This is the result of a gap in banking-grade technology and the lack of neobank-like experiences for the end clients.\u201d\n\nShe said they [Kwara] have been thrilled to see the \u201cexcitement around the Kwara brand among credit unions and their members, which is fast becoming synonymous with a superior user experience and the future of banking. Thanks to our investors, we will now be able to offer an end-client experience that is 100 times better than what they previously had access to\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking,\u201d said Ben Marrel, Founding partner at Breega, who led the investment. \u201cKwara\u2019s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions. We are both proud and excited to be helping this outstanding team scale across Africa and other emerging markets.\u201d\n\nKwara aims\u2014without branching away from its core mission of empowering credit unions across Africa and the rest of the world\u2014to help 1 billion people benefit from credit unions through its neobank by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of what the metaverse is or could be is still one that eludes many people.\n\nHowever, millions of dollars are being invested in this virtual universe.\n\nOn November 29, 2021, BusinessToday.in reported that Canadian investment firm, Tokens.com, spent $2.5 million on a virtual land in the metaverse.\n\nThe land was bought on Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the land has an address. It\u2019s located in the fashion street district of Decentraland. A place where fashion shows and probably concerts will be held in the metaverse.\n\nWhile the idea still seems unreal, the amount of money being invested is very real.\n\nIn 2017, Decentraland raised $26 million in Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).\n\nIn fact, one of the most valuable companies in the world, Facebook, changed its name to Meta and has spent $50 million on research into the metaverse.\n\nAlthough the metaverse might seem like the future everyone should get in on, there are still major barriers to entry, including money and education.\n\nThe cheapest piece of Decentraland land costs 3ETH, roughly $12,000. Besides being expensive, how does one find land in a virtual world?\n\nHowever, lands aren\u2019t the only form of investment on the metaverse; there\u2019s also gaming.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s new product, Metaverse Magna (MVM) is creating a path for Africans that\u2019ll ease them into the metaverse through games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is gaming on the metaverse all about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxie Infinity homepage\n\nBe it in the metaverse, on a PlayStation, or a mobile game, gaming is pretty much the same thing.\n\nBut in the metaverse, gaming is done a bit differently.\n\nAxie Infinity is, to date, the most established metaverse gaming platform. Unlike regular games, Axie Infinity exists on a blockchain which means you buy and sell characters, upgrades, and power-ups with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform, created in 2018 by a Vietnamese company called Sky Mavis, is currently valued at $3 billion.\n\nKnown simply as Axie, it allows gamers to earn as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nGamers on the platform grew to 1.8 million in August this year and about 40% are from the Philippines.\n\nWhere does Nestcoin\u2019s Metaverse Magna come in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaverse Magna home paage\n\nTo enter the brightly coloured metaverse with strange-looking game characters on Axie Infinity, you need to own gaming creatures or a variety of things known as assets.\n\nThese creatures, regardless of how weird they look, do not come cheap. According to Rest Of World, game assets can set you back as much as $1,500. That\u2019s over 2000% higher than Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nAccording to research by market research and data specialist firm, KLA, only 3% of the people who own crypto in South Africa have up to $3,000 worth of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile expensive Axie assets are a barrier, the metaverse is still in its infancy and not many people understand how to get in.\n\nNestcoin\u2019s MVM wants to help players get these creatures while they get a percentage of their earnings. Something like AltSchool. for gaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Metaverse Magna gamers.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, Onyinye Umeaka, MVM General Manager, said, \u201cWe are sponsoring anyone out there with access to the Internet, and just the commitment to improving their quality of life with an opportunity to earn a good living playing crypto games.\u201d\n\nShe said MVM will purchase the assets and create gaming accounts, lend the accounts to players willing to learn, play, and earn.\n\n\u201cAs the players play, they earn cryptocurrency, and based on the earnings, we split it between ourselves and the players, the players get to keep 70% based on performance, and then we get to keep 30%.\u201d\n\nGaming scholarships started in the Philippines\n\nWhile the rest of the world had the pandemic and lockdowns to contend with last year, the Philippines were also struggling with typhoons and floods. And when it became almost impossible to get jobs, some people turned to gaming.\n\nPer Rest Of Worlds, \u201cWorkers in the Global South are making a living playing the blockchain game, Axie Infinity.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, there are platforms such as MVM that offer scholarships to gamers. For example, there\u2019s Yield Guild Games (YGG), managing up to 4,7000 players, or scholars as they\u2019re called.\n\nEven VC\u2019s are investing\n\nYGG raised $4.6 million in August this year to accelerate play-to-earn gaming. Claiming to have earned up to $8.6 million with Axie Infinity, it plans to buy more gaming assets and onboard more scholars.\n\nAlthough nowhere near YGG, MVM is already making moves in crypto gaming.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been running the experiment now for a couple of months. We actually have about 130 plus players already playing the games within our scholarship programme,\u201d Umeaka said.\n\nUnlike YGG, however, MVM is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). This means MVM is a community of players, community managers, and development managers.\n\nPlayers are coached and trained on strategies that will help them win games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MVM gamer, playing games\n\nAlthough MVM seems more centralised than decentralised, Umeaka said it\u2019d be a DAO with its own tokens where gamers and investors will be the stakeholders.\n\nMVM was created in partnership with Old Fashion Research (OFR), a multi-strategy blockchain investment fund.\n\nNestcoin CEO and Co-founder, Yele Bademosi, believes the play-to-earn Metaverse could get a lot of Africans out of poverty.\n\nHowever, Middle, Eastern, and Western Africa still have low Internet penetration rates of 26%, 24%, and 42%, respectively. Lower than the global average of 59.5%.\n\nWith the amount of volatility associated with all things crypto-related, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can say for sure that crypto gaming will continue to be valuable.\n\nAuthor Bolu Abiodun He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial institutions use different approaches to IP valuation as part of their financing process. One of the threshold considerations for lenders in evaluating whether and how much to loan a borrower using its IP as collateral is determining the scope and value of the company\u2019s IP portfolio. Unlike inventory and equipment, where established procedures can predict the value of such assets today and in the future, the value of a company\u2019s intellectual property assets is considered to be far more speculative.\n\n\u201cMaximizing Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets\u201d report (PDF) by the Athena Alliance, issued in 2009, provides context for financial institutions\u2019 approaches to IP and intangible asset-based financing. By highlighting effectively structured and completed Intangible Asset (IA) debt-and-equity arrangements, the Report addressed the fundamental difficulties in IA finance that face financial firms and corporations alike. The survey found that the most major barrier to increased interest and involvement in IA finance is the uncertainty around intangible asset valuation.\n\nValuation plays a different role in IP financing, based on two considerations: (1) Present and future cash flow for the purpose of servicing the loan repayment plan; and (2) Value to cover the investment in the event of default.\n\nSome financial quarters view the use of certain forms of IP as collateral to be problematic because the financial firm is ultimately concerned with the revenue-generating potential of the asset on which the firm is basing its investment in the company. If it is to be valued in the event of default, which is of paramount importance to the potential creditor, this revenue generation must be able to be achieved independently, even partially, from the company.\n\nIt has been argued that for banks to lend positively and directly against the value of IP and intangibles in isolation (setting aside regulatory considerations), it is necessary for the bank to be confident that it can dispose of the IP separately from the business if the need should arise, in much the same way as it can expect to do with an item of tangible property.\n\nBarriers to IP-based financing for startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\n\nDespite its potential for innovation financing, IP-based finance is widely believed to be underexploited, by young startups that would need it most. Intangible assets account for more than half of the enterprise value in most startups. Startups typically seek external funding in the form of equity financing, but this can also be challenging. There are additional levels of uncertainty in the valuation of early-stage technologies.\n\nIn some cases, the extent of complementary assets necessary to generate earnings may be unknown. The degree of uncertainty in the development trajectory influences the valuation approach chosen, but it does not invalidate the valuation process entirely. These considerations are generally incorporated into licensing negotiations and can be accounted for in a valuation. However, the asset\u2019s risk profile and the range of probable outcomes should be reflected in the valuation report.\n\nFor investors, particularly business angels and venture capitalists, the presence of IP acts as signals on the quality of the company. The key distinction between debt and equity financing is that equity investors invest in the entire company rather than just the IP. As a result, they typically assess the company\u2019s expected profitability without assigning a specific financial valuation to the IP. Because the enterprise\u2019s technology is new and unproven, and the enterprise lacks an established market, IP valuation may not work for startups. A VC may be more interested in IP value at exit, particularly if the purchaser is a corporation.\n\nIn a research commissioned by the European Commission Expert Group on Valuation, in identifying significant differences in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups compared with larger corporates that have a strong trading history, it was observed that IP is mostly evaluated and not formally valued in the regular banking, VC, or Private Equity sectors. Liens, warrants, and debentures on IP assets, as well as numbers relating to IP capitalized on the balance sheet, may be examined \u2013 but only as risk factors, not as part of a formal IP valuation. This reluctance in the IP valuation market may be attributed to information asymmetry, regulatory lapses and market immaturity.\n\nVenture debt as an alternative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Iwaria via Iwaria.com\n\nWith the growing recognition of the value of IP assets, there are a few segments of the regulated credit market that have devoted themselves exclusively to serving startups and high-growth companies in the tech industry. These segments are described as \u201coutlier banks\u201d. Outlier banks, in particular, lend to early-stage and late-growth stage enterprises that have already obtained venture capital investment.\n\nThe lending decisions made by the outlier banks are based on the probability that the VC-backed companies will secure subsequent rounds of equity money from investors. This type of financing, known as venture debt, is a hybrid equity-and-debt financing structure that allows businesses to borrow money in the form of a loan while also offering warrants for equity in the company in addition to the loan interest. This arrangement offers the loan issuer with a considerable upside as an incentive to lend to an otherwise risky enterprise.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough established valuation methods for IP exists in Nigeria, it has, however, not gained mainstream acceptance, and valuation is still mostly seen within the context of tangible property. Nigerian banks must understand that there is a significant difference in the approach to lending to SMEs and start-ups when compared to larger corporates with a strong trading history. A solution is required to fund the commercialization of innovative ideas using the value of the intellectual property asset as collateral. There is a clear need to increase market actors\u2019 confidence and certainty in IP valuation methods in order to stimulate IP transactions, support IP-based financing, and provide companies with tools to provide information about their intellectual property.\n\nThere is a need to develop new financial market segments dedicated to the valuation, exchange, and financing of IPRs and other intangibles, by establishing the necessary pre-conditions and infrastructures for such markets to operate efficiently and effectively on a global scale.\n\nAuthor Mosun Oke Mosun is a consummate Attorney with wide experience in Corporate/Commercial, Intellectual Property and Competition/Anti-trust law practice.

According to a 2002 NAFDAC study, nearly 41% of pharmaceuticals in the country were counterfeit.\n\nIn addition to being ineffective in treatment, fake drugs could also endanger the lives or well-being of patients. Yet, counterfeit drugs are not the only challenges bedevilling the Nigerian healthcare system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is the risk of getting fake drugs, there is also the possibility of not getting medications when you need them.\n\nWhile NAFDAC appears to have intensified its fight against fake drugs, the issue of access remains. And DrugStoc, a Nigeria-based healthtech startup, is helping to solve that problem.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Chibuzo Opara and Adham Yehia, DrugStoc connects manufacturers of quality pharmaceutical products to hospitals and pharmacies.\n\nBoth co-founders met as Yehia was looking for an advisor for his Masters in Health Innovation Management. Their shared experiences in the healthcare space was a common ground, and they moved to Nigeria to tackle healthcare challenges in the country.\n\nThey soon realised how difficult it was to get quality pharmaceutical products and started DrugStoc in 2015. Since then, they\u2019ve served over 20 million people and plan to reach 100 million in the next 18 months.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo has more on this story: Using cloud-based technology, DrugStoc is powering a pharmaceutical supply chain for the African market\n\n54gene unveils 7River Labs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthtech startup, 54gene, has announced the opening of its diagnostic arm, 7RiverLabs. Equipped with state of the art facilities, the startup has set up sample collection centres in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. In addition, there are plans for more centres in ten Nigerian cities and other African countries in the coming months.\n\nSpeaking on the launch, Dr Abasi Ene-Obong, 54gene\u2019s Founder and CEO, said, \u201cLaunching 7RiverLabs is a manifestation of one of the goals 54gene set out to achieve two years ago \u2013 to improve diagnostic and treatment outcomes on the continent. With the range of tests 7RiverLabs offers, millions of Africans can begin to take greater control of their health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing able to diagnose a medical condition properly is crucial in treating diseases. However, not all hospitals in Nigeria have the required facilities for this.\n\nConsequently, test samples are often sent outside the country, leading to increased costs for patients. In some cases, patients cannot get a diagnosis because they cannot afford these tests.\n\nWith most Nigerians paying for health out of their pockets, this puts a significant strain on their finances and could lead some to forgo treatment.\n\n7RiverLabs promises affordable tests delivered a few hours after testing. Currently, 7RiverLabs conducts over 300 molecular tests covering infectious diseases, microbiology, clinical chemistry, and oncology.\n\nNigeria\u2019s 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a bidding process at the Transcorp Hilton Abuja, MTN and MAFAB Communications have emerged as winners of the 5G spectrum auction conducted by Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government.\n\nThe auction, organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in collaboration with the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, auctioned two lots of 100 MHz for $273.6 million each.\n\nFollowing the bidding\u2019s close, the Executive Chairman of the NCC, Prof Umar Danbatta, announced that the winners have between now and February 2022 to pay the winning price to the Federal Government.\n\nThis development comes as a boost to Nigeria\u2019s 5G plans.

          "text": "Four months to the announced date by the Federal Government that a national carrier, Nigeria Air, would commence operations, BusinessDay\u2019s checks show that there are no personnel, investor and physical or technical structure on ground currently to make this a reality.\n\nBefore an airline is considered ready to commence operations, the airline must have gone through the five different stages of acquiring Air Operating Certificates (AOC) for local flight operations from the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), and these stages take between one to three years, depending on how satisfied the authority is.\n\nIn addition, the airline must have readied its aircraft, whether leased or purchased; it must have four key technical staff, some that include the chief pilot, chief operations officer, maintenance officer and chief engineer, and must have an operational base.\n\nInvestigations carried out by BusinessDay show that the country\u2019s prospective national carrier currently has not met any of these criteria, and industry stakeholders have expressed concerns as to how the airline hopes to kick off in four months\u2019 time with none of these structures on ground.\n\nThree weeks ago, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved April 2022 as the take-off date of Air Nigeria, the proposed new national carrier.\n\nHadi Sirika, minister of aviation, said the Federal Government would own only 5 percent equity in the airline while other Nigerians would get 46 percent. He disclosed that strategic partners, including foreign airlines, would be identified to take up the remaining 49 percent equity (as we write, no known technical partner has been mentioned).\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, says he was surprised to hear the minister announcing April 2022 as the take-off date for the national carrier because the airline has no structure or investor in place.\n\n\u201cIn four months, how does the minister hope to go through the five stages of the AOC and fly in April? This will be a miracle, and this has confirmed the fears of the industry that the airline will be favoured, allowed to override the system and processes and will bully the regulator and all other participants in the industry,\u201d Ohunayo states.\n\nRead also: Terminal operators fault Opeifa on slow train services at ports\n\nHe however stresses on the need for a level playing field, saying that whatever structures, systems, processes or checks and balances other investors are subjected to, it must also be the same for investors of Nigeria Air.\n\n\u201cWhy will a 5 percent holder be the one deciding on the fleet to be used, routes that will be operated, take-off date and other operational issues? These should be determined by the management and board of the airline, which are not yet in place,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to John Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), a 5 percent shareholder cannot plan and dictate to the rest having 95 percent stake.\n\nOjikutu says any attempt to set up or continue with the planned national carrier will lead Nigeria to a government carrier that will end up the way of the Nigeria Airways.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing on ground to show that Nigeria Air can take off and land by April 2022,\u201d Ibrahim Mshelia, owner, West Link Airlines Nigeria and Mish Aviation Flying School, notes.\n\nMshelia says whether Nigeria will use leverage or get incentives, the time is too short and it is unrealistic for the national carrier to commence operations in four months.\n\nThe aviation expert, who says he was an advocate for a befitting airline for Nigeria, be it national carrier or flag carrier and privately run with government\u2019s interest mentioned, states that setting up an airline without the interest of Nigerians means the country would be doing itself the greatest disservice.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge market. We are struggling with capital flight, foreign airlines sell tickets and they have to repatriate the money out of the country. But if we have a Nigerian carrier representing us, the money stays here, but we must get it right. It is a shameful thing that the largest African nation has no airline or flag carrier,\u201d he states.\n\nMshelia explains that since the COVID-19, it takes an airline about one year to renew its AOC, yet Nigeria Air, which is a new airline, plans to get an AOC in four months\u2019 time, and now the minister is talking about starting an airline in five months.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot muscle anything in the airline business. Government can give leverage, there can be government\u2019s backing and funding but the government cannot do anything about the process. If the government does otherwise, they will be setting a precedent they cannot sustain.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot be seen lowering the standards. We should ask the minister to explain to us how he is going to start an airline that has not been registered in four months. April 2022 is another dream. There is nothing on the ground,\u201d he says.",

          "title": "How targeted, low-cost financing can tackle housing deficit",
          "text": "At various intervention levels, the housing deficit in Nigeria has seen different approaches to tackling it with little or no results. But experts have offered fresh insights into how targeted and low-cost financing can resolve the seemingly intractable problem.\n\nIt is expected that targeted funding initiatives will ameliorate incremental construction or self-funded construction problems. This would ease pressure on the public sector, leaving room for governments to address appropriate town planning, building standards, the provision of land title issues, and infrastructure trunk-lines for water and power.\n\nThough Babatunde Fashola, Nigeria\u2019s works and housing minister, says Nigeria does not have a housing deficit, dismissing whatever the country has as an urban problem, housing shortage in the country is real and many sector stakeholders are in agreement with this.\n\nThe deficit is estimated variously at 17 million, 20 million and 22 million units, depending on who one is speaking to.\n\nAccording to Danladi Matawal, former director-general/CEO, Nigerian Building and Roads Research Institute (NBRRI), the deficit is even more than the stated figure, citing findings by Worldometer (2017), which noted that from 2012 to 2018, Nigeria\u2019s population increased from 168,240,403 to 191,835,936, showing a significant addition of 23,595,533 people to the population.\n\n\u201cThe housing deficiency has, therefore, climbed and is likely to worsen in the nearest future if urgent steps are not taken by the government in conjunction with all stakeholders to address the problem,\u201d he said at an international housing conference in Abuja.\n\nThis explains why, as efforts intensify to return the country to the path of sustained growth, there has been an increased focus on the real estate sector\u2014specifically the affordable housing market. The persisting and widening deficit has seen more and more people unable to afford the cost of owning their own home.\n\nRead also: SEC pledges collaboration to reduce housing deficit\n\nBesides investment in affordable housing, there are also schemes such as buy-to-let, and affordable mortgage schemes including the national housing fund (NHF) and lately the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) which offer low interest rates.\n\nThe experts added that efforts at tackling the deficit resulted in the formation of the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), the Building Materials and Manufacturers and Producers Association of Nigeria (BUMPAN).\n\nAt the continental level, organisations like Shelter Afrique offer a much-needed injection of large-scale private funding to address both demand-side and supply-side constraints. As the only pan-African financial institution dedicated solely to the growth of Africa\u2019s housing and real estate sector, Shelter Afrique offers developers a payment structure similar to those available in Germany, the United Kingdom and Hungary.\n\nThese offer favourable terms like 10-year loan payment periods at competitive interest rates. Indeed, the pan-African housing finance institution has a clear mission \u2013 to increase access to quality, low-cost housing across Africa.\n\n\u201cShelter Afrique offers a range of financing facilities to support the delivery of affordable housing and to stimulate the demand side across Africa including but not limited to Lines of Credit and Project Finance,\u201d according to Andrew Chimphondah, GMD/ CEO, Shelter Afrique.\n\nBesides a $619 million commitment to the Solar Homes Systems Project, to install solar home systems for up to 5 million households, serving about 25 million individual Nigerians who are not currently connected to the national grid, Chimphondah disclosed plans by the organization to support affordable housing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cShelter Afrique is committed to supporting large scale, affordable housing schemes in Nigeria through the issuance of a N250 billion bond. This is planned to provide affordable housing and homeownership to low and medium income home buyers, consequently improving their standard of living,\u201d he assured.\n\nRecently, the pan-African housing finance organization partnered REDAN to finance 12,000 affordable housing units in Nigeria. The memorandum of understanding, signed in July 2021 will see 6,000 units developed across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria in the first phase of the project.\n\nHowever, for international agencies such as Shelter Afrique, making inroads into new territories like Nigeria can be difficult. Exchange rate volatility and sky-high interest rates make financing projects a dicey game, but there are ways to mitigate the issue.\n\nWhile Shelter Afrique, alongside other institutions like the African Development Bank (AfDB), is working hard to address the staggering housing deficit across the continent, domestic parastatals and organisations also play a crucial role.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) has been consistent and proactive in providing loans and financing across the real estate value chain. In 2020 alone, FMBN distributed $30.5 billion (US$74 million) through its service offerings to bring home ownership within the reach of more citizens.",

There is no manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThat was okay when we had money to import, but today we don\u2019t. The price of imported items will keep going up and many more Nigerians will not be able to afford these.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe solution is that we now have to begin to manufacture the things that we consume because if we don\u2019t, we will be in trouble in the next few years,\u201d he warned.\n\nReiterating the need to strengthen the manufacturing sector, Obaseki noted: \u201cWhy are we not manufacturing today? It is because the government and civil servants are not leading in that drive to encourage investors. When investors come to set up a business, it appears like you are doing the investors a favour, and most times, they don\u2019t even know where to go, they go from one ministry to another.\n\n\u201cThe ministry will just make things difficult for the investor. The process of doing business or manufacturing is difficult already, and because of our import mentality, we caused obstacles on the way. We have not had an investment culture for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are not welcoming investors, particularly in the manufacturing investment area. From when I became a governor, I made it clear that one of our priorities is to empower young people, focusing on job creation. But who is going to provide the jobs? Is it the government? That\u2019s not possible, as the majority of the jobs in society are created by private businesses.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this exercise will take us a step forward. We will make our commitment as a government that whatever is going to encourage and make the investment process easy, that is what we are going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will create the environment and make the land available; we will make infrastructure available and ensure government agencies put the investment processes in place. We challenge you to bring investors to us and see how the process will work,\u201d he noted.\n\nEarlier, the Country Coordinator, Nigeria Manufacturing Africa, Yasmin Osaghae, said the organization is keen on how best to drive investment in Edo.\n\nOsaghae emphasized that it was necessary to assist the state in removing bottlenecks that impede investments in order for investors to seamlessly set up in the state.\n\n...",

          "text": "Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said banks should be prepared for policies that could negatively impact on profit margins in the wake of renewed threat posed by Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis comes amid global concerns about the emergence of more transmissible Omicron variant of the virus first detected in South Africa last month.\n\nEmefiele who said this yesterday in Lagos at the 12th Annual Bankers\u2019 Committee retreat with the theme: \u2018Building Resilience for Economic Growth,\u2019 appealed to members of the Bankers\u2019 Committee to be prepared to lend their support to the country whenever the need arises as they did in the past under the umbrella of CACOVID.\n\nThe apex bank governor noted that the bank through its Target Credit Facility (TCF) had disbursed a total of N370 billion to households as well as micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) in line with efforts to stimulate economic activities.\n\nThe CBN had as part of efforts to cushion the devastating effects of the COVID-19 on households and firms introduced the TCF in March 2020, which has since attracted 800,000 beneficiaries till date with an outstanding of N30 billion still available for disbursement, ThisDay reported.\n\n\u201cYes, the economy is growing, inflation is moderating, we are beginning to see signs even in the midst of the third or the fourth pandemic, but I must say that whereas we see the green light at the end of the tunnel, I must say that the road ahead for us to get to the green light remains very rough.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to crave your support to work with us because we will continue to come up with policies that in your own boardrooms you will find hurtful to your own quest to make more profit for your shareholders,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele thanked members of the Bankers\u2019 Committee, noting that they stood strong to help the country to cope with the impact of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 broke, we called on the banks under the umbrella of CACOVID and the banking industry stood strong with the private sector and we did the little we could to help our country and to help our people to overcome the challenges of COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe banking industry constitutes a very important segment of the monetary policy and of government, even from textbooks that we have read in economics, banks constitute what we can call catalysts to growth in any economy.\n\n\u201cWe called on you, we did several things appealing to you, it got to a point where I was beginning to appeal to say, look, how can we have a situation where the banking industry is growing, the banks are declaring profit but the economy is not growing well, or that our people are living in destitution and that it is not possible for us as bankers to live a comfortable life and yet in the midst of destitution and problems in our country.\n\n\u201cWe did call on you and you rose to the occasion and you supported. I thank you, sincerely. I cannot say that central bank did this alone, everything that we have done since February 2020, realising your importance as a catalyst to growth in the economy has been with your support, I thank you.\n\n\u201cI must say, yes, the economy is growing, yes, inflation is moderating, yes, we are beginning to see signs even in the midst of the third or the fourth pandemic, but I\u2019m most say that whereas we see the green light ahead of us at the end of the tunnel, but I must say that the road ahead for us to get to the green light at the end of the tunnel remains very, very rough.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to count that you rely and work with us to say that it\u2019s not just about you making profit for your shareholders but it is also about you contributing to the growth of our economy even where there are some discomforts, you will play your part, stand strong and support the government and support the Central Bank of Nigeria to deliver a stronger and resilient economy.\u201d\n\nThe governor while addressing participants at the retreat called on banks to enhance credit to critical sectors of the economy, stressing the need for the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to rise above five per cent annually, higher than its present average growth rate of 2.7 per cent, ThisDay reported.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cGiven our mandate to promote a sound monetary and financial system, and working with the fiscal authorities, the CBN took unprecedented measures to contain the effects of the pandemic on our economy and spurred increased productivity in key sectors.\n\n\u201cFirst, the CBN collaborated with the fiscal authorities to formulate strong policy support measures through the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) to restore stability and catalyse growth.\n\n\u201cIn support of the recovery efforts, the bank deployed more than N3.5 trillion, which is about 4.1 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, to support critical sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, electricity, and construction. Other CBN policy measures that we took to help the economy recover included a reduction of the monetary policy rate from 13.5 percent to 11.5 percent to spur lending.\n\n\u201cThe reduction of the interest rate on all CBN intervention loans from nine per cent to five per cent, extension of the moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facility to March 2022, regulatory forbearance for banks to restructure loans to sectors severely affected by the pandemic and creation of a N400 billion TCF for households and small and medium enterprises. Of this, nearly N370 billion has been released to over 800,000 beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Emefiele also pointed out that a N1 trillion facility for local manufacturing and production in critical sectors of the economy was also established. On this, so far, 53 manufacturing, 21 agriculture-related, and 13 service projects had been funded from this facility.\n\nIn addition, he reiterated that a N200 billion healthcare intervention fund for pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners was also established in the wake of the pandemic, to expand and strengthen the capacity of the country\u2019s healthcare institutions and mobilise.\n\nFurthermore, he disclosed that the CBN mobilised key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, under the Private Sector Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) team that raised N39.65 billion to tackle the scourge.\n\n\u201cContinued implementation of efforts to boost credit to productive sectors is required to sustain the recovery, quicken growth, and improve the livelihood of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWith population growth at about 2.7 percent annually, it is important that we continue to deploy measures that will enable our economy to attain faster and balanced growth rates of over 5 percent on an annual basis.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of these efforts and given current global realities, I enjoin and challenge this Bankers\u2019 Committee Retreat to focus on fashioning out strategies to fortify the fabric of the Nigerian economy, boost growth and engender resilience especially to exogenous shocks.\n\n\u201cTo spur growth, we will need to assess policy measures that can address subsisting imbalances and constraints to finance. This retreat should provide actionable steps to ensure that the Bankers\u2019 Committee continue to make meaningful contributions to Nigeria\u2019s growth and development,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, the CBN Governor outlined some of the policies the apex bank has undertaken in recent time to support the federal government in its job-creation as well as economic diversifican drive.\n\nThe he listed to include the 00 for 100 Initiative, under which targeted credit of up to N5 billion would be provided to 100 firms every 100 days.\n\nSelected firms would be those investing in Greenfield projects, significantly able to create employment opportunities, and use local raw materials. The initiative will also support firms producing goods for the export market.\n\n\u201cOn the growth of the digital economy, the CBN is focused on building a robust payment system in Nigeria which is cheap, fast, efficient, and safe. With the growing pace of digitalisation globally, we will continue to leverage digital channels in fulfilling this objective.\n\n\u201cReflective of the confidence in our payment system, between 2015 and 2020, about $700 million has been invested in firms run by Nigerian founders,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira which is the first central bank digital currency in Africa and one of the first in the world, the eNaira will foster greater financial inclusion using digital channels, support cross-border payments for businesses and firms, and provide a reliable channel for remittance inflows into the country.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira will ensure that Nigerians in remote areas can conduct financial activities using their digital devices at little or no cost,\u201d Emefiele said.",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) Tuesday raised the alarm to the effect that some groups and individuals were planning to cause a breakdown of law and order in the country.\n\nIt also said some persons desperately seeking power use wrong and skewed narratives to not only mislead citizens, but overheat the polity.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr Peter Afunanya, who revealed this at a media parley at the Service\u2019s Headquarters, further said many were simply out to use the situation to cause divisions among citizens, seek cheap popularity and/or present the country as ungovernable.\n\nThe Service also raised the alarm that recessing members of National Assembly and State Houses of Assembly and other public and private sector workers on vacation may be predisposed to threats of various degrees.\n\nThis, according to him, also applies to Nigerians travelling from within and outside the country to join their loved ones for the celebrations.\n\nThese individuals, Afunaya said, are susceptible to kidnapping, hijack, assassinations, armed robbery and political manipulations.\n\nIn similar vein, the Service also accused the legal team of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of misleading the public on its client\u2019s condition, saying the accused person is given \u2018choice\u2019 food items.\n\nKanu, currently in the DSS custody, is facing some sedition-related cases.\n\nHis legal team had in an interview with journalists claimed Kanu was being maltreated in the DSS\u2019 custody.\n\nRaising the alarm on some sinister moves by unnamed individuals and groups, Afunaya said: \u201cThe Service, therefore, warns that those who are involved in these should desist from such destabilising acts.\n\n\u201cIt also enjoins politicians to play by the rule and avoid statements or activities capable of inflaming the fires of division and violence prior to 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cOpinion moulders like the clergy, religious and traditional rulers are also to guard their utterances and avoid inciting pronouncements.\n\n\u201cIn a related development, it is common knowledge that criminal elements will heighten their inglorious activities before, during and after the festive periods.\n\n\u201cTherefore, religious and community leaders, hoteliers and operators of markets, parks, recreational and relaxation centres are to be at alert and watch strange movements and activities around their facilities.\n\n\u201cSuch facilities include places of worship, palaces, markets, schools and other public buildings.\n\n\u201cOwners and operators of these public spaces and their patrons should endeavour to isolate and report suspected rogues to security agencies for prompt response.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Service\u2019s interactive website and complaint lines will remain active and available to the public.\n\n\u201cIts formations at the State and local Government levels will be open 24 hours of the day. This is in line with the Service\u2019s commitment and support to the populace.\n\n\u201cAs schools vacate and students return home for holidays, there is likelihood that subversive gangs will target them for recruitment for undesirable intents.\n\n\u201cThese may include but not limited to financial crimes, armed robbery, civil disobedience and violent protests, substance abuse, banditry and kidnapping.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, parents and guardians are advised to be watchful of their children and wards and ensure that they do not engage in unlawful acts.\n\n\u201cAside students, recessing members of National Assembly/State Houses of Assembly and other public/private sector workers on vacation may be predisposed to threats of various degrees.\n\n\u201cThis also applies to Nigerians who may travel from within and outside the country to join their loved ones for the celebrations.\n\n\u201cThese individuals are susceptible to kidnapping, hijack, assassinations, armed robbery and political manipulations.\n\n\u201cThey are advised to be security conscious in order not to fall victims of these attacks and destructive political manoeuvres.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate at this juncture that those who sponsor kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, insurgency and all kinds of attacks on security agents, civilians and vulnerable populations should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cThese persons, whether in the North or South, know themselves. There is no doubt that they have crossed the lines and it is now time to crush them.\u201d\n\nIPOB\n\nHe further said: \u201cOn IPOB and the alleged ill-treatment of its detained leader, the Service has, without any fear of contradiction, applied restraint in making public statements over the matter.\n\n\u201cThe reason is simply because it avoids joining issues especially over a matter that is sub-judice. But for the sake of transparency and democratic accountability, the Service has decided to make some clarifications.\n\n\u201cIt (the Service) denies all the inciting allegations by IPOB and states that:\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu is not, in any way, maltreated in custody. Accusations of maltreatment negate the Service\u2019s Standard Operation Procedure on the implementation of rights of a suspect;\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu enjoys full luxury in the holding facility incomparable to any of its type anywhere in the country. He is accorded full rights and privileges. He is never denied his right of worship or freedom from his select religious practice.\n\n\u201cAdequate attention is paid to Kanu\u2019s health. He has unhindered access to the best medical care and doctors.\n\n\u201cKanu, himself, has confirmed to his visitors that the Service has never, in any way, maltreated him. He even confirmed this to the quartet of Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinnaya Abaribe; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Nigeria and Co-Chair, Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace and Ambassador Okechukwu Emuchay, MFR, Secretary-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, who saw him on Wednesday, 8th December, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe story of Kanu being starved is fallacious. He could not have been starved as he enjoys meals of his choice. That he is not allowed change of clothing is also false.\n\n\u201cHe is regularly allowed change of clothing as against what is presented to the public by IPOB propagandists. Assuming he is being maltreated, how come his visitors told him he was looking well?\n\n\u201cAll the allegations of violation of his rights as a suspect, victimization and starvation among others are not true.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that some elements have decided to use outright misinformation to represent the state of affairs.\n\n\u201cThose who make these false stories do so to attract undue attention for the singular purpose of achieving a desired end. Rather than focus on how he should get justice, Kanu\u2019s legal team and some mischievous elements among them have chosen to use fake news to mislead the public.\n\n\u201cWhile the Court in its wisdom ordered that Kanu be remanded in the safer DSS Custody, some of his legal representatives, for reasons best known to them, preferred Kuje Prison and have failed to explain the rationale for such choice.\n\n\u201cIt may interest the public to note that a particular lawyer among Kanu\u2019s Team is feasting on the matter such that one can conclude that his interest is beyond getting justice for his client. Be that as it may, the Court has the final say on the matter.\n\n\u201cInstructively, the media is reminded of its duty in national security. As influencers, media practitioners are called upon to use their platforms to pursue peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cThey must commit themselves to the unity of the country and shun misinformation, fake news, hate speech and such other misleading narratives.\n\n\u201cJournalists, while discharging their constitutional roles, are enjoined to be objective, conflict-sensitive and patriotic in their reportage.\n\n\u201cOverall, citizens and residents are advised to cooperate with security and law enforcement agencies for lasting peace in the country.\n\n\u201cThey should be wary of efforts designed from within and outside the shores of the country to misdirect or use them to undermine public order. Therefore, they should exercise caution in the way and manner they may conduct their affairs during the festivities and beyond.\n\n\u201cOn its part, the Service will continue to collaborate with other sister agencies and relevant stakeholders to ensure that all law abiding citizens and residents pursue their legitimate businesses without hindrances.\n\n\u201cWhile it has become expedient to issue these warnings and advisories, the Service maintains that it will not hesitate to deal, in accordance with the law, with those who may wish to test its resolve in ensuring internal security and national stability before, during and after the yuletide.\n\n\u201cFor those that wish to, they must note that nemesis and the long hands of the law will definitely catch up with them.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, no one, no matter how highly placed, will be allowed to take laws into his or her hands.\n\n\u201cFinally, the DG, Management and Staff of the DSS appreciate everyone who has supported the Service in its effort to ensure peace and security in the country.\n\n\u201cLet us remember that security is the responsibility of everyone. Let us support security agencies to achieve the desired peace for our country.\n\n\u201cWe wish every one of you and indeed all Nigerians a hitch free yuletide season. As we look forward to a new year, we wish you a prosperous 2022.\u201d\n\nHealth worker, factory manager killed\n\nMeanwhile, a health worker and a water factory manager kidnapped last month in Tegina, Rafi local government area of Niger state, have been reportedly killed by their captors, who had earlier collected an N8 million ransom for their release.\n\nThe bandits have also asked for a N20 million ransom and a Smartphone to release the corpses and the remaining victim in their captivity.\n\nThe health worker, Sani Garba, a resident of Tegina, was the officer in charge of immunisation in Rafi local government area.\n\nHe was among four residents kidnapped at Tegina November 14 at a water factory. The factory\u2019s manager, Kasimu Lawan, was also killed in captivity.\n\nPremium Times reported how they were abducted in Tegina, the town where 136 pupils of an Islamiyya school were earlier abducted on May 30.\n\nNinety of the 136 students of Salihu Tanko Islamiyya Schoolwere released August 26 after their parents reportedly paid N60 million in cash and five new motorcycles.\n\nWeeks before that incident, bandits had also kidnapped scores of students from a public secondary school in Kagara, in the same area.\n\nOn Tuesday, an official of a road transport union in the town, Bello Muhammad, said the community contributed N8 million ransom to secure the release of the abducted persons.\n\nHowever, after making the payment, the people were told that two of the victims had been killed by the bandits.\n\nMuhammad said another victim, Mas\u2019udu Ibrahim, escaped from captivity, while Bako BK, the owner of the water factory is still being held by the bandits.\n\nMuhammad said the ransom bearer returned with a gory picture of the deceased victims, which made the residents observe funeral prayers (Salatul Ghaib) for the deceased.\n\nThe bandits also requested a fresh N20 million, three new motorcycles and two Smartphones, equivalent in value to the one seen with the deceased health worker, as a ransom for the release of the corpses and the remaining captive, Muhammad said.",

Everybody has been complaining of hunger in the land and it is true,\u201d the Sultan said.\n\n\u201cOne of the major problems we all know is that a hungry man is an angry man.

          "text": "The African Development Bank\u2019s (AfDB) board has offered Nigeria a $210 million facility to co-finance Phase 1 of the Nigeria Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Program (SPAIZ).\n\nThe initiative is expected to unlock Nigeria\u2019s agriculture sector potential and promote industrialisation through the development of strategic crops and livestock.\n\nThe first phase would be implemented with co-financing from other partners at $538.05 million and designed to concentrate production, processing, storage, transport, and the marketing of commodities such as cotton or maize, increase productivity, competitiveness and reduce logistic costs.\n\nOther funding institutions include the Islamic Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development that would provide parallel co-financing while Nigeria\u2019s federal and state governments would contribute both in cash and in kind.\n\nAccording to a statement from the AfDB, the facility represented one of its most ambitious operations in terms of scale and scope to date, stating that the project areas would account for 19 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total land mass and would benefit 50.4 million people.\n\nIt would also target seven Nigerian states and the country\u2019s Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Phase 1 Zone construction is expected to augment the following value chain commodities: Cross River State \u2013 cocoa, rice and cassava; Federal Capital Territory \u2013 beef and dairy livestock; Imo State \u2013 beef and dairy livestock; Kaduna State \u2013 tomato, maize and ginger; Kano State \u2013 rice, tomato, groundnuts and sesame oil; Kwara State \u2013 livestock; Ogun State \u2013 cassava, rice, poultry and fisheries and Oyo State \u2013 cassava, soybean, rice,\u201d it added.\n\nThe project, according to the AfDB, was envisaged to support Nigeria\u2019s efforts to raise agricultural productivity, promote investment, create wealth and jobs, and transform rural areas into corridors of economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWe have several million hectares of available arable land and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones (SAPZs) across the country,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari had told world leaders at the recent Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, adding that, \u201cthese initiatives, we believe, will make it easier for investors in agriculture.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President of the AfDB Group, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, \u201cthis first phase of the program is not government-driven. It is government-enabled and private sector-led. That is the critical way in which you have structural transformation of agriculture.\n\n\u201cIt is impressive to see a strong commitment from the Nigerian government \u2013 a very strong commitment from the Nigerian Minister of Finance and from all of the state governments because they have to give the land, they make sure that all the regulations and incentives are provided.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Director General of the AfDB\u2019s Nigeria Country Office, Lamin Barrow, said: \u201cPhase 1 of the Nigeria SAIPZ program will mobilise private sector investment in the agro-industrial hubs and agricultural transformation centers.\n\n\u201cIt will impact some 1.5 million households as direct beneficiaries, with a target of creating 400,000 direct jobs and up to 1.6 million indirect jobs.\u201d\n\nThe SPAIZ was described as AfDB\u2019s flagship for the implementation of its Feed Africa Strategy.

          "title": "Analysis: Why Buhari Will Sign Amended Electoral Bill Before Dec. 19",
          "text": "Although under intense pressure from different quarters, particularly governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, might have resolved to sign the amended Electoral Bill, forwarded to him by the National Assembly on November 19.\n\nSources within the presidency told THISDAY that the delay had been largely due to pressure on Buhari from governors, who were uncomfortable with the idea of direct primaries and wanted the clause expunged from the amended law.\n\nBut the president, the source said, was convinced by the new electoral bill as proposed and the need to ensure participatory democracy, especially, having promised to leave a legacy of credible electoral system, of which the law is critical.\n\nAccording to the source, who preferred anonymity, \u201cYou also need to understand the process, because there is a process, or if you like, protocol to these things. Remember that immediately the bill was forwarded to the president by the National Assembly, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, wrote to the president and advised against it.\n\n\u201cIt was after this that the governors took up the campaign and asked for the aspect of direct primaries to be yanked off, citing many reasons that could not fly in the face of logic. But if the president was going to listen to his AGF or give in to the pressure by the governors, the process is that he would have instructed the AGF to draft a letter of response back to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThus, if a process like that has been triggered, then you would have known that the president was not going to sign it, following the same channel of communication and as advised by his AGF. But since it was sent to him, the president had just kept quiet. Knowing that signing is just about a small ceremony and solely the call of the president, so, he could choose to delay it and just sign whenever he wants for as long as it is before the deadline.\u201d\n\nCiting another reason why Buhari would sign the bill into law, the presidency source said the National Assembly was going on recess this Thursday, December 16. If there was going to be any communication rejecting the bill, he would have triggered the process before they embark on their recess, as they wouldn\u2019t be back until later in January, and by which time, the process for the Ekiti State governorship election would have begun.\n\nThe source explained, \u201cIt belies logic that the president would write to the National Assembly after they had proceeded on recess. Therefore, if he is not writing them between now and Thursday, when they would go on recess, then, it is a deal. He will sign it, since the signing ceremony is his personal business.\u201d\n\nHowever, listing another equally important reason why Buhari would sign the bill before the deadline, which is Sunday, December 19, the source said, apart from the fact that the diplomatic community was also mounting pressure on the president, his commitment to ensuring a free, fair and credible election was another thing he could not renege on.\n\nThe source explained that at a recent virtual Summit for democracy organised by the United States President, Joe Biden, Buhari in his speech reiterated his commitment to leaving behind a lasting legacy of credible poll for the nation\u2019s democratic development, and this, he added, the diplomatic community would hold him to.\n\nBuhari\u2019s address stated: \u201cI am proud to state that Nigeria has had over two decades of uninterrupted democratic governance and has unequivocally remained committed to upholding the core values and principles of democracy. Since assuming office in 2015, we have been able to introduce mechanisms to ensure free, fair and credible elections.\n\n\u201cWe have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives. However, despite our democratic achievements, Nigeria continues to face the challenge of insecurity, which poses a threat to our democracy. We therefore call on global partners to support our efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\n\u201cAs we countdown to our next general elections in 2023, we remain committed to putting in place and strengthening all necessary mechanisms to ensure that Nigeria will not only record another peaceful transfer of power to an elected democratic government, but will also ensure that the elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\n\u201cYour Excellences, Nigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region West Africa and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\n\n\u201cI will conclude by reaffirming Nigeria\u2019s enduring commitment to upholding, promoting and protecting democratic values and principles and strengthening the institutions that underpin a resilient democratic society.\u201d\n\nWith these, the source maintained that the president would sign the bill before the Sunday deadline as part of his commitment to bequeathing on the nation an enviable electoral legacy.\n\nMeanwhile, those pushing for the direct primaries to be taken out are not resting on their oars. They were said to be mulling their options, too. They were alleged to have recently advised the president, through their inner contacts, to inform the principal officers of the National Assembly that he would withhold his assent and urge them to reconsider the timing for the submission of candidates list from 180 days to 90 days, as it stipulated in the 2010 amended electoral act.\n\nBut others, believed to be interested in the legacy of the president have told him that even if he would return the bill on the grounds of a few contentious clauses, including the direct primaries, he must ensure that the entire effort at amending many other clauses did not go to waste and get the legislature to return it in record time, after their final alterations for his eventual assent.\n\nWhichever way this is programmed to swing, analysts have contended that the credibility and legacy of the president are at stake. He would, therefore, have to choose between his own legacy and the need to please some vested interests.\n\nOlawale Olaleye",
