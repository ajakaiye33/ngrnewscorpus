          "title": "Low turnout, insufficient ballot papers mar Plateau LG election",
          "text": "The Local Government election held in Plateau State on Saturday, was marred by voters\u2019 apathy and insufficient election materials.\n\nThis is as a former governor of the state, Jonah Jang, described the exclusion of the Peoples Democratic Party from the election as shameful and a mockery of democracy.\n\nThe State Governor, Simon Lalong, after voting in Ajikamai, Shendam Local Government Area, said the local government election would consolidate peace in the state.\n\nLalong told journalists that it was usually difficult to transit from one elected government tenure to another, adding that \u201canytime we come to the end of the tenure of local government councils, people become anxious about the caretaker committee.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had fears that the elections might not hold due to the court case instituted by the PDP at the Court of Appeal, Lalong said, \u201cWe had no fear because we know the courts will do justice according to our laws. Even if they had ruled that the elections would not hold, we would have obeyed the ruling.\u201d\n\nLalong also praised voters in his polling unit for their peaceful conduct and large turnout to elect their chairman and councillors.\n\nBut one of our correspondents who visited Alikazaure Tudun Wada, Rayfield, Mai Adikwo, Abattoir, Goradong, Gura Topp, Rukuba Road, and Agwan Rukuba in the Jos South and Jos North LGAs of the state observed that most of the polling units had low turnout of voters.\n\nIn Jos North LGA, the election was characterised by voter apathy as most people stayed away from the polling units.\n\nIn some polling units in Hill Station Junction, Farin Gada, Jenta Adamu, Apata, Tudun Wada and Hwolshe, a few voters were seen after voting had begun, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.\n\nSimilarly, there was poor turnout in some polling units at Busabuji, Laranto, St Murumba and a host of others.\n\nSome of the voter registers had recorded one vote cast, others had three while some did not record any vote at all as of the time of visit to the polling units.\n\nIn Mangu, Pankshin and Kanke LGAs there was low turnout of voters though the News Agency of Nigeria reports the poll was conducted peacefully in the three areas.\n\nAt Sabin Gari, Angwan Hausa II and III and Panyam township School polling units among others in Mangu, the presiding officers were only issued 500 ballot papers each for Chairmanship and Councilorship elections.\n\nMost of the polling polls over 1,000 registered voters especially Angwan Madaki, GSS Pankshin A, Kabwor 1 polling units which polls 1,640; 1,181; and 1,315 registered voters respectively.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we have only two booklets of 500 leaflets each for the election of Chairman and Councillors in this polling unit, \u201d Mr Bello Annas, Angwan Hausawa III Presiding Officer, explained.\n\nAt GSS Pankshin B, the two booklets of 300 leaflets for chairmanship and councillorship poll issued to them got exhausted around 1.50 pm and were waiting for the PLASIEC LG Supervising Officer to supply them with more ballot papers.\n\nThe Presiding Officer of the Polling Unit, Ms Alice Christian, lodged the complaint with the Acting Chairman of Pankshin LGA, Mr Yakubu Isa-Fobur, who assured her of immediately tackling the shortage to ensure smooth completion of the exercise.\n\nThere was a large turnout of voters in some parts of Kwararafa, Konan Soja, Sabon Layi and other areas.\n\nThe Presiding Officer, Kwapkuwa Polling Unit, Pankshom Ward of Shendam LGA, Peter Chintok, said the turnout was encouraging.\n\nJang rues PDP exclusion from Plateau LG polls\n\nMeanwhile, Jang, in a statement, signed by his Media Consultant, Clinton Garuba, noted that it was unfortunate that the PDP did not participate in the poll.\n\nSunday PUNCH reports that the PDP had gone to court to challenge its exclusion by the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission from the LG election.\n\nAfter Justice Ishaku Kunda of the Plateau State High Court upheld PLASIEC\u2019s decision to bar the PDP from participating in the polls, the party filed an interlocutory injunction at the Appeal Court, praying the court to restrain PLASIEC from conducting the council poll pending the determination of the main suit.\n\nOn the eve of the poll, around 10.15pm, the Court of Appeal sitting in Jos rejected the ex parte motion for an order to stop the election from being held.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Moses Ugo agreed with the appellant that it was wrong for PLASIEC not to issue nomination forms to the PDP to contest in the election. He, however, refused to grant the application stopping the election and agreed with the respondent that doing so would violate the spirit of the 1999 constitution given the peculiar situation of the matter.\n\nThe judge then adjourned the case till November 22, 2021 for hearing on the substantive suit.\n\nBut Jang, a PDP leader, said it was unfortunate that an election that should have evoked joy for the people as they filed out to elect their leaders was turned into a charade by the ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf the APC government was as popular as it has portrayed itself to be, the right thing to do was to allow its state-funded umpire to conduct a free, fair and credible election to test its popularity. The Plateau State Government must bury its head in shame. Denying the people their right to choose candidates is the worst kind of impunity and anti-people treatment to receive from those who occupy elective offices.\u201d\n\nSeven political parties \u2013 African Action Congress, Young Progressive Party, New Nigeria Peoples Party, Social Democratic Party, Peoples Redemption Party, Boot Party and the APC \u2013 participated in the polls held across the 17 LGAs in the state.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "PDP screening committee to shortlist three chair aspirants Wednesday",
          "text": "The screening committee for the chairmanship of the Peoples Democratic Party will by Wednesday present a list of three persons from which the party will choose the next National Chairman, Sunday PUNCH has learnt.\n\nA usually reliable party source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confided in our correspondent in Abuja on Saturday, said that each of the three zones which made up the North are to each present a candidate.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWe in the PDP are guided by democratic principles. Each of the three zones has been asked to go and sit among themselves and present a candidate for us to choose from.\n\n\u201cIn the event that they fail to agree, they should put it to vote; whoever wins will be the candidate for his zone. They are expected to conclude that by Wednesday, at the most.\u201d\n\nAnother source, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, \u201cAlthough the former Senate President, David Mark, is the clear favourite, we have people from other parts of the North who have indicated interest.\n\n\u201cFormer Kogi State Governor, Ibrahim Idris; another former Senate President, Iyiochia Ayu, from Benue State; former Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu; and Prof. Jerry Gana also from Niger State, all from the North-Central have shown interest.\n\n\u201cFrom the North-East, we have former Gombe State Governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo, and our Deputy National Chairman (North), Suleiman Nazif, from Bauchi.\n\n\u201cThe North-West has former Kaduna State Governor, Ahmed Makarfi; his Katsina State counterpart, Ibrahim Shema; and Kabiru Turaki, SAN, from Kebbi State.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that the North-Central which is highly favoured to produce the next chairman will meet at the Benue State Governors\u2019 Lodge to take a decision on who to present.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the PDP National Headquarters, on Saturday, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, who is one of those advocating for a consensus candidate, expressed optimism that the North will present a candidate that will lead the party to victory.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cConsensus is normally a process of democratic consultation because democracy is about consensus.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the electoral process can be reduced by having a convergent point on an individual and that would have reduced the disparaging issues within the party.\n\n\u201cI did say we should have a consensus candidate but, where we will not, we will not practice imposition.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved the issue of zoning. The PDP is a mature party. We have always done this within the experience we have garnered over the years. And what we have been able to do for this country.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt from our mistakes; we are not going to play to the gallery the way and manner our distractors or our competitors want us to be.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Secessionist groups wouldn\u2019t emerge if Jonathan\u2019s confab report was implemented \u2013 Alao-Akala",
          "text": "A former Governor of Oyo State, Adebayo Alao-Akala, speaks with OLUFEMI OLANIYI on sundry issues including the 2023 Presidency\n\nThere are fears that if a sitting governor becomes the chairman of a political party, he may not want to relinquish the post easily. Is that what is playing out with the Bauchi State Governor Mai Mala Buni as the caretaker chairman of the All Progressives Congress?\n\nHe is working to stabilise the party. Necessity is the mother of invention and necessity has brought him there, and I do not think he will relinquish the governorship of a state and come and sit tight as the chairman of a party. They don\u2019t pay them there. Let me tell you, we are begging the Yobe State governor to be there because he is working for our party and there is no salary for what he is doing.\n\nAre you satisfied with the way the Federal Government is handling the cases of secessionist agitators, Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho?\n\nI don\u2019t understand what you mean by the way the cases are being handled. It will be very difficult for me to make a categorical statement on the cases because the facts there are not available to me. The cases have to do with security and it will be very difficult for me to comment on them because the facts of the cases are not available to me.\n\nBut what is your view about self-determination agitators?\n\nThey have the right to do that. But another thing is whether they have the capability to succeed. It is their right to agitate.\n\nWhat is your position on quest for a Yoruba nation?\n\nI am for one Nigeria. I don\u2019t know how old you were when Nigeria fought a civil war to maintain our oneness. Are we going to throw away the country just like that? God brought us together and Nigeria is not the only country with many ethnic groups. In the United Kingdom, there are English people, Wales, the Scots and the Irish. The same thing is there in the United States. In Ghana, there are many ethnic groups also. I was brought up in Ghana. There will still be agitation even if we are given Yoruba Nation today. Some people will complain that the Ijebu people are dominating us, while some will say the Egba are dominating us and things like that. So, let us remain where we are and make things work. The only thing I think we should do is to understand how best we can define our coexistence.\n\nSo, how best do you suggest we should define it?\n\nThe best way to do this is to let everybody have a say, just like what was done when former President Goodluck Jonathan was in power. We need to implement those things. Again, our presidential system of government is very expensive.\n\nSo, what system of government will you suggest?\n\nLet us go for a parliamentary system of government, It will save costs. Another important factor is that if we want to operate federalism, let us be federal and if we want to be anything let us remain true to it. Let each of the regions develop at its own pace. I want a system where the central government will be weak and the regional governments will be strong. That will bring about development very fast.\n\nIs that not what those calling for restructuring are agitating for?\n\nYou can call it any name you like, but that will work better for us.\n\nAre you in support of it?\n\nYes, I am in support of it. Not only am I in support, the APC is also in support of restructuring.\n\nBut has the party has not done much about restructuring?\n\nIt depends on how you see it. Southern governors have taken a position that Presidency should shift to the South in 2023 and their northern counterparts have also said they need to negotiate with the North before such can happen.\n\nShould it still be subjected to negotiation in 2023?\n\nI won\u2019t tell you whether it is negotiable or not. Let me take you back to our political dispensation. Power shift is not my own priority, my main concern is to get the best person to do the job for us. Why am I saying this? In 1999, the Peoples Democratic Party went to beg former President Olusegun Obasanjo to come and be president. He did not tell anybody that he wanted to be the president. In 2007, the late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua did not say he wanted to be the president, the ticket was given to him on a silver platter, he didn\u2019t spend money. Goodluck Jonathan was given free of charge. He didn\u2019t have the intention of becoming the vice president when he was given the ticket. Baba [Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd)] said he was done with politics and he even cried. But when the people realised that he was a sellable politician, they went and begged him to come and contest again. When dollars were flying everywhere, he remained calm but he became president. All those who have become President were virtually begged and don\u2019t be surprised that we may have to beg another person to come and be the president in 2023.\n\nBut is that not the reason Nigeria is not being ruled by the best?\n\nI disagree with you. There is a saying in my part of Yorubaland that there is no bad king. Every king is good but their lieutenants are always the problems. There is nobody that will occupy that seat and will not want to do good. But when you are occupying that position, you are shut from seeing what is happening around you unless you are told. Former President Goodluck Jonathan who you mentioned is being touted to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC. Who are the people saying that?\n\nPeople on the street are saying he will contest\u2026\n\nI have not heard that. I am a politician and a very good one for that matter but I have not heard that.\n\nIs he not welcome to join the APC?\n\nIt is his right to join any political party he desires to join.\n\nDo you see him winning if he contests in 2023?\n\nThat I don\u2019t know but it is his right.\n\nBut you were quoted to have said that he would not become president in 2023. Why did you say that?\n\nThey misquoted me. What I said was that he would join the league of those aspiring to be president. We have those aspiring to be president in the APC. When Obasanjo was brought to be president, there were people who were working to be president then and the late Dr Akex Ekwueme was one of them. I said Jonathan would join the queue of those aspiring to be president on the platform of the APC if he joins the party and he has the intention to contest, but they misquoted me. Jonathan has the constitutional right to contest if he so wishes. After all, he contested and won before. Ponder on what I said earlier, maybe the person who will be the president has not even shown interest and he may just be called upon to come and contest, just like it was done before. They would just tell him we want to use your name to sell our product. It has happened before and it can happen again. Look at what happened with the way the past four presidents were produced. None of them came through the correct political process.\n\nDo you believe that the 1999 Constitution is the bane of Nigeria?\n\nI said earlier that we should change our constitution if possible. That we should change to the parliamentary system of government. One thing against the constitution is that the military was in a hurry to hand over power after the death of Chief MKO Abiola and General Sani Abacha. They hurriedly put the constitution together. People were tired of the military and the military hurriedly put that constitution together. When Obasanjo came, he tried to correct it. He instituted a Justice Niki Tobi panel to look into it, but the report was put aside. That is one problem with Nigeria, you spend money on something and the recommendations will not be implemented. When Jonathan came, he organised a confab and a lot of money was spent. The report was put somewhere. That was when we could have done a lot of corrections but the report was put away. The constitution we are using now is even telling lies against us. The opening statement is \u201cwe the people of Nigeria\u201d but we all know that the people did not make the constitution but the powers that be then did it. When the colonial masters wanted to hand over power to our fathers in 1960, there was a constitutional conference before that. They agreed on how they wanted to govern the country. If that was done then, let us talk again now. We have used the constitution for more than 20 years with little success, so let us try another one.\n\nAre you saying the Federal Government should revisit the report of the confab?\n\nDefinitely yes. We have had so many reports that we put some there to gather dust. Jonathan handed the report to President Buhari when he was leaving the office. So let us revisit the report. If the report was implemented then, all those agitating for restructuring or self-determination would not have had anything to say. They would not have been making that noise.\n\nAs a security expert, how best do you think adequate security can be restored to Nigeria?\n\nI have said it many times that the first thing the nation should do is to equip the police very well. Police are in charge of security and if they are given adequate equipment to work with, they will perform wonders. The nation should take care of the welfare of the police. The police have been parading some of the kidnappers they arrested in the past two months or so. They are the people that can do it and not the military. They should stop giving huge amounts of money to the army, instead the police should be heavily funded. I am not saying this because I retired from the police but because the police are the ones that were trained to do that. If anything happens to you now, the first thing you do is go to a police station and not the army barracks. So, why don\u2019t you equip those who the constitution has saddled with the task of providing internal security? Train the police and retrain them regularly; take care of all the training institutions of the police and you will see a great change. We had everything when I was in the police.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the recruitment process into the police now is even wrong?\n\nDuring our time the process was different from what is happening now. In those days, you were not allowed to join the police at 30 years of age. But I have seen a situation now where a son, the father and the mother are in the police. The son is senior to the father not because of his better educational qualification but because the father joined the force after the son had enlisted into the police. That should be looked into. But what is happening in the police is just a reflection of what is happening in other government institutions.\n\nIs the APC in good shape to reclaim power from the People\u2019s Democratic Party in Oyo State in 2023?\n\nYes, the party is ready to do that. The APC will take power from Governor Seyi Makinde in 2023.\n\nAre you saying this despite the crisis within the party?\n\nThere is no crisis in the APC in Oyo State. What is happening is not something unusual. Politics is all about conflict resolution. There will always be conflict of interest and when there is something like that, you move quickly and solve it. That is why we leaders are there. We are very good to take over from the PDP.\n\nWhere will the APC in Oyo State zone the governorship ticket in 2023?\n\nWe will not zone the governorship ticket to any part of Oyo state. Every interested aspirant should be free to contest. Everybody who is qualified to hold the position should be free to apply.\n\nWhere will they apply?\n\nTo the people who will decide during an election. I will make sure that my colleagues in the party agree with me that the governorship ticket should not belong to any part of the state. We are all indigenes of the state.\n\nA PDP chieftain said during your 70th birthday lecture that Ibadan had been dominating the rest of the state for so long\u2026\n\nI put it in my book. It is a chapter there: \u2018Ibadan and the rest of us\u2019. At times they say, don\u2019t contest this position because of their number. They would say this position is meant for Ibadan and others should go and look for something else but I will not be there when it is pronounced that this position is for Ibadan.\n\nIbadan has 16 lawmakers out of 32 seats in the House of Assembly. But it is the same thing that happened in Lagos State. In 1967 when Lagos State was created, it had 20 local government areas and that time Kano State was also created and it had 44 LGAs, Jigawa was created out of it and it has 37 local government areas now while Lagos has remained with the 20 LGAs which it had since that time. That is the creation of the military which we are saying should be corrected. When I was governor, I took the Nigeria Population Commission to court for saying Katsina State is more populated than Oyo State. It is not possible.\n\nThere are claims that you are working for Senator Teslim Folarin. How true is that?\n\nI am a party leader and my interest is the party. Those who are saying that should go and work and stop being lazy. I worked hard before I was asked to be running mate to Senator Rashidi Ladoja. They should also work hard. Those of us who went to the school of Baba Lamidi Adedibu know the importance of hard work. Baba himself was not lazy, he worked really hard.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Before now, don\u2019t forget that in every state and of course every part of this country, we have armed robbers, kidnappers, cultists, and the state governments in South East were able to contend them; we didn\u2019t have this kind of killings. When IPOB came and started agitation with hate speech and killings and formation of militant group and that\u2019s where we are, and the people are beginning to ask, if you are fighting to protect us; why are you killing us? Occasionally, people are imported from outside to do the killings but majorly, like in my state, all the people we have arrested for killings, all came from the South East. The people are beginning to understand and if people understand, then we will be going back to where we were in fighting criminality. We are telling our youths any- where in the South East, whatever are your grievances, come let\u2019s discuss together. But if you say no, that you will continue in the way of criminality, we will isolate you. People are not staying at home out of obedience but out of fear for their lives. If there is enough security, nobody is going to obey any sit-at-home. We will do everything to protect our people because they don\u2019t like the way the agitators of Biafra are going about it. Meanwhile, all elites in South East are not desirous of Biafra; we don\u2019t want Biafra. We want to be treated equally like other regions in Nigeria.\n\nINEC is worried over insecurity in the South East, especially as it concerns the Anambra election. What are the governors doing to arrest insecurity to enable the election hold? We discussed the Anambra elections in our meeting in Enugu. But unfortunately, our col- league, the Anambra State Governor was not in the meeting. Were he present at the meeting, we would have been able to evaluate the stories we are hearing that killings in Anambra State are politically motivated, but on the other hand, saying there should be no election in Anambra State; if we don\u2019t do election, we will run into constitutional crisis. And of course, the National Assembly and Mr President are there to sort that out. IPOB is positioning themselves as the ones doing the killings because they are the ones saying if you come out; they will kill you, and I think Federal Government should do everything possible to show that they are in charge. The election must hold even if it is shifted within the limit of constitutional provisions. But that election must hold.",

          "title": "Ejimakor, IPOB lawyer: I wonder why FG stopped dialogue with Kanu in 2017 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "Yes, I did. But let me put it another way. Even though Kanu was undoubtedly amenable to prosecution or trial based on the charges pending against him from 2015, his subsequent extraordinary rendition from Kenya has changed all that. That\u2019s why I commenced the constitutional suit that is now pending before the High Court of Abia State. But because this question is now subjudice, I cannot comment on its merits but I can give you an excerpt of the case-in-chief that I adduced in the originating processes I filed in court. My case-in- chief is this: That it is fundamentally wrong for the Nigerian State to levy a lethal military attack on Nnamdi Kanu at his home in Abia State while he was free on bond and having failed to kill him, to then pursue him to Kenya and abduct him without due pro- cess of law. The abduction, the torture that followed and the unlawful imprisonment in Kenya, plus his consequent expulsion from Kenya to Nigeria, are manifestly unconstitutional and amount to infringement of his fundamental rights. There\u2019s an unbroken chain of notorious violations that started in Afara-Ukwu, Abia State in late 2017 and culminated in Kenya in June 2021. It is trite that when a state forcibly takes a fugitive suspect from a foreign country to its territory without giving the person the benefit of the extradition process, it amounts to an act of extraordinary rendition that, without more, triggers insurmountable legal barriers to prosecution. Under applicable laws, a renditioned fugitive is entitled to a body of remedies known as collectively reparations, which includes restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. One such law provides that \u2018restitution should restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law. Restitution includes restoration of liberty and return to one\u2019s place of residence.\u2019 In many nations, extraordinary rendition has been held by the courts to be a legal barrier to prosecution. I will give one example with the United Kingdom where the House of Lords held in such a case that \u201cWhere a defendant in a criminal matter had been brought back to the United Kingdom in disregard of available extradition process and in breach of international law and the laws of the state where the defendant had been found, the courts in the United Kingdom should take cognisance of those circumstances and refuse to try the defendant.\u201d I know that Kanu\u2019s case is unique, novel and presents matters of first impression. Yet, it presents a golden opportunity for a Nigerian court to determine whether it\u2019s lawful for the Nigerian state to make an extrajudicial attempt on his life in 2017 and having failed, to then pursue him to Kenya, abduct him, torture him and rendition him to Nigeria without due process of law, all because he is engaged in self- determination, which is a protected political opinion but one which the government of the day is seeking to suppress by means of punishment of some sort. If what they did to Kanu is legal, why did they resort to the extradition processes of Benin Republic and why is America equally applying to extradite Abba Kyari instead of simply levying extraordinary rendition on him? That\u2019s the crux of the matter.\n\nDo you see his non-production in court by the DSS, in recent legal appearances, as a vindication of your statement, or prophecy, as it were? Let me put it this way: Democratic Nigeria has never had a successful treason trial. Since 1960, democratic Nigeria has had many treason trials without any \u2013 except for that of Obafemi Awolowo \u2013 netting a conviction or even coming close. No other person has ever been convicted of treason or its garden varieties like treasonable felony or sedition throughout all the democratic dispensations in Nigeria. Even when that of Awolowo resulted in conviction, it immediately brought many issues that still dog Nigeria to this day. Plus, Awo\u2019s conviction most probably would not have happened had he not overconfidently opted for summary trial when he could have tarried awhile. What\u2019s more? His trial was later found to have been tainted with pro- found judicial bias. And in quick time, his conviction and sentence were commuted. Most remarkably, his conviction convulsed Nigeria to no end, especially Western Nigeria. And it ultimately contributed to the 1966 coups that directly led to the Civil War and its horrendous aftermaths. The lessons from this are not hard to see, and they are: First, treason is a regime-specific political offence. So, unless the trial is dubiously concluded during the life of the extant regime, it sunsets with the coming of a new regime. Second, treason trial \u2013 if pushed too aggressively \u2013 can bring more problems than it initially set out to contain. In some climes, it led to overthrow of the very government in power, such as in the case of Jerry Rawlings who went from being in jail for treason to overthrowing the very government that jailed him. So, Nigeria needs to tread with caution and a keen reference to history as it ramps up on this overly aggressive treason trial of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. When an alpha patriot like Kanu gets so upset with the system that he begins to seek solutions in separation or self-determination, you talk to him; you don\u2019t subject him to trials and tribulations. Simple! As Kanu\u2019s lawyer, how do you see his on-going trial? Any hope of him ever getting freed at the end of the day? Before anybody forms an opinion on whether Kanu should\u2019ve been charged in the first place, not to talk of being actually tried, you need to first understand the position of the law on what he does. A lot of people may not be aware but the truth is that the enterprise upon which Kanu is en- gaged and which grounds his prosecution is known as self-determination which is legal, not criminal; not even unlawful under Nigerian law. One such law, at CAP A9, Laws of Federation of Nigeria states that all peoples shall have the \u201cunquestionable and inalienable right to self-determination\u201d; and that \u201coppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bonds of domination by resorting to any means recognised by the international community\u201d. One of such means is referendum. So, as you can see \u2013 when you express an intention to break away from your country, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong that should warrant your prosecution for treason. Men are known to be stoic as they would not openly cry or shed tears. In your pursuit of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s case, has there been any time you had cause to cry, even if in secret? The truth is this: Defending the right of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB to self-de- termination is tough in any society or with- in a regime that believes that espousing self-determination is a criminal offence, or that those you\u2019re defending are terrorists. For this reason, I have had two horrendous situations with the authorities where I had to also defend myself for merely being a lawyer to Kanu/IPOB. Nnamdi Kanu him- self is personally aware of this. Because of the exigencies of the moment, I can\u2019t say any more on this other than to add that a lot of times, it feels like being marooned between a rock and a hard place. A lot of people are talking about finding a political solution to this impasse so that we can move on as a nation, and, from what we learnt, there are talks going on in that area. If your client is offered amnesty or freedom on the basis that he renounces his political stance, why won\u2019t he accept the offer? You will recall that back in early September 2017, Mazi Kanu was in talks with the Southe-East governors, with the tacit blessings of the Federal Government. Then, all of a sudden, the dialogue was terminated and Python Dance was brought to bear. It was not Kanu that terminated the dialogue. When someone demands self-determination through referendum, he has shown sufficient consideration to the state, such that should warrant some reciprocity that can begin with a dialogue. Kanu has never ruled out dialogue. So, what\u2019s stopping the authorities? Presently, the legal team is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s only link with the outside world. One of the complaints some factions in IPOB allegedly have against you is that it is difficult to know when Kanu is talking and when you are injecting your own thoughts and calling them Kanu\u2019s. Could you react to this allegation? I don\u2019t know of any factions in IPOB, not to talk of any factions having complaints against me or questioning the veracity of what I might\u2019ve discussed with Kanu in private, which, by the way, borders on legal strategies for his defence. I\u2019ve clarified this matter previously that any time you see any of Kanu\u2019s lawyers being attacked publicly, it should be attributed to fifth columnists whose sole intention is to complicate my legal defence for Kanu. In other words, one of the ways you can easily identify the true enemies of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB or those that don\u2019t wish them well is to listen to the words of those attacking his lawyers, his deputies and family members at a precarious moment like this. As for me personally, it seems that those against me are threatened by the merits of the legal manoeuvres I\u2019m currently undertaking in defence of Kanu. A few of them hide under claims of being IPOB members but their words and actions will show that they are not bonafide members of IPOB. I cannot be distracted by such insane antics. Despite the reported directive from Kanu to IPOB to call off the sit-at-home strike, the exercise has continued to hold in several parts of Igboland. What do you have to say to this, and how does that make Kanu feel? It means that the sit-at-home has turned a new corner where it is now possessed of the toga of voluntarism that underscores the widespread discontent in the land. In other words, the sit-at-home speaks for itself. So, instead of criticizing or fighting it, the authorities should see it as a pre-referendum on what is at stake and an opportunity to change course and address the issue constructively. Many people see Nnamdi Kanu as an angry man, always cursing people, always abusing and insulting people. In your interactions with him, has he ever laughed? Mazi Kanu is a rare gem. He\u2019s possessed of many superlative qualities. He has charisma and high intelligence quotient, plus a good heart. He\u2019s emotionally stable, and yes \u2013 he has a lot of laughter in him, and despite his rhetoric, he hates nobody. He hates no tribe. He hates no religion. What he hates is systemic injustice of man against man. That\u2019s what drives his rhetoric. Are you in touch with his wife? What was your last discussion with her? Does Kanu miss them? Yes, I\u2019m in touch with his wife and from what I know, she is a young woman of extraordinary strength, character and intelligence. Like the wife of someone fighting for the freedom of his people, she understands the sacrifices and tribulations that may come. In summary, she is very upbeat and stable. As for Mazi Kanu, yes \u2013 it\u2019s natural that he will miss his family. He loves his wife and his children deeply. There\u2019s no doubt about it. He\u2019s a great family man, a great husband and a great father.",

          "title": "N2.65tn Unremitted Funds: Buhari Approves NEITI, Others\u2019 Plan to Go After 77 Defaulting Oil Firms",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has given the go-ahead to a coalition of anti-graft agencies, including the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to recover about N2.65 trillion unremitted funds by 77 oil companies operating in the country.\n\nBarely two weeks ago, NEITI disclosed that 77 oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria were indebted to the federation to the tune of N2.659 trillion, arising from failure to remit petroleum profit tax, company income tax, education tax, value added tax, withholding tax, royalty and concession on rentals.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja on the status of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation in Nigeria, Executive Secretary of the organisation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, stated that when converted to forex, government was being owed $6.48 billion at today\u2019s official exchange rate of N410.35.\n\nHe noted that a breakdown of the figures showed that a total of $143.99 million was owed as petroleum profit taxes, $1.089 billion as company income taxes and $201.69 million as education tax.\n\nAccording to him, others include $18.46 million and \u00a3972,000 as VAT, $23.91 million and \u00a3997,000 as withholding tax, $4.357 billion as royalty oil, $292.44 million as royalty gas, while $270.187 million and $41.86 million were unremitted gas flare penalties and concession rentals respectively.\n\nBut the NFIU Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Modibbo Tukur, who spoke when he visited the NEITI secretariat to officially sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two government organisations, noted that it was unacceptable that government would be owed such huge funds at a time it was borrowing to fund major projects around the country.\n\nTukur, who broke the news of the president\u2019s nod, pointed out that the Minister of Finance had been directed by the President to oversee the process, including the setting up of a panel of the anti-corruption agencies to recover the unremitted monies.\n\n\u201cAnd that (NEITI\u2019s hard work) has led to some kind of fruition because I briefed him (President Muhammadu Buhari) this morning and you may not be aware of it. This week, Mr. President has officially approved all the recoveries to be done in this area. The Minister of Finance has been directed to set up a recovery panel with the EFCC, NEITI and NFIU in it and even NAPIMS and all the others.\n\n\u201cSo, we are heading to maximum transparency. And there will be consolidation of data coming from NEITI, from NFIU and other agencies and there will be very clear reconciliation with the players and those regulating the sector. So, no more hiding of our national revenues. We all know what we are going through. Nobody wants to see the government borrow,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe noted that although he had done some work in the past with the organisation, this time around, the new NEITI management was raising the standard in the execution of EITI principles, traversing the entire country and getting results.\n\nTukur stated that the NFIU has various departments which will fully analyse every single kobo owed the government, adding that there\u2019s no more hiding place for people who defraud the government.\n\nAccording to the NFIU boss, from the organisation\u2019s in-depth work on analysing the flow of funds, a huge chunk of monies from illegal extractive business was either being moved out of the country illegally or used in financing terrorism.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo this is also a natural environment issue where people hide and they do illegal mining, they exploit, then they do certain things and they move it out of the country without even the Ministry of Mining knowing and sometimes they go as far as using this sector to finance terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe ran into so many cases, in this particular area when we were doing our analysis on terrorism. So, I think today is the day to congratulate you because we are taking off and you will see the results because now we have all seen the zeal.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about N2.6 trillion, then we also reported over $5 billion not paid in the area where the players are, which is the Niger Delta area. And then over N700 billion not paid, and in some cases companies receiving as agents and not even remitting.\u201d\n\nTo achieve greater transparency, the NFIU stated that artificial intelligence must be deployed, because, according to him, it\u2019s almost impossible to get full remittance when human beings are involved in the end to end collection of revenues.\n\n\u201cVery soon, both our teams will move to the Ministry of Finance, where we are going to sit down, call these companies and talk about the real issues. We have walked the walk so that the results will come in. And from that data you have and the one we have, the alert will start coming in very soon,\u201d he assured.\n\nEarlier, Orji stated that the essence of the collaboration was to strengthen partnerships to ensure that resources available in the country are prudently managed in a manner that benefits all Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that the process that culminated in the MoU commenced earlier in the year, with special attention to the management of information and data in the oil, gas and mining sectors because of the strategic importance of the sectors to the economy.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all sit down and watch as a few people will want to fritter the resources that are available to this country. This country is in a haste to develop and needs resources to provide roads, water, electricity, build infrastructure for our people and our teeming youths and make life abundant and to reduce the exodus of our youths to other jurisdictions where they go and even things get tougher.\n\n\u201cWhen we travel around the world and we meet Nigerians, I feel pained because some of them are the best talents and brains that could have been more useful in our country,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrji noted that the relationship between NEITI and NFIU will be underpinned by information sharing, joint preventive and remediation action in governance processes, regular capacity building and training, joint stakeholder awareness creation, intelligence sharing and investigations.\n\n\u201cEveryday, we get reports of illegal mining, extortion and selling of our mineral resources in the international market without any consideration, especially in the area that these activities border on our national security,\u201d he lamented.\n\nWhile expressing joy that the president was acting quickly to enhance NEITI\u2019s work, Orji explained that the organisation had met with the EFCC, ICPC, NFIU for similar engagements which have gone beyond signing papers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Buhari set to make proclamation as exercise gets N178bn in Budget 2022\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nA national population and housing census, which was last held in Nigeria 15 years ago, will hold in the country next year, thanks to the N178.09 billion approved for the exercise in the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who made the disclosure during the public presentation and breakdown of Budget 2022 in Abuja, yesterday, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari would make a proclamation on the planned 2022 headcount soon.\n\nAhmed explained that the recent review of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was motivated by a number of factors, including the need to provide the funds for the headcount.\n\nThe last population census held in 2006, puts the nation\u2019s population at 140 million people, but was plagued by political interference, from design through to implementation.\n\nSince then, Nigeria has not conducted a population census, relying on estimates from Worldometre, an arm of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nIn December 2020, the National Population Commission (NPC) announced that an estimated 206 million people were living in Nigeria, an increase of eight million people in two years, against the 198 million it announced in 2018.\n\nThe finance minister also revealed an additional N100 billion in the 2022 Budget estimates to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) prepare for the conduct of the 2023 general elections.\n\nGiving further insight into why the MTEF was reviewed, the minister said the increase in the expenditure side was also motivated by the need to provide for additional critical expenditures, as well as the need to present a more comprehensive FGN Budget.\n\nOther critical expenditures in the 2022 budget estimates include N400 billion for National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy; N50 billion Police Operations Fund; and N37 billion additional provision for debts accruing from the electricity bills of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).\n\nThe minister further disclosed that N517.5 billion was proposed as additional Multi-lateral/Bi-lateral Project-tied Loans; N54 billion for the National Agency for Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), which represents 1% FGN Share of Federation Account; and N305.99 billion for TETFUND (funded by the Education Tax).\n\nAhmed said the fiscal numbers were preliminary and would be updated \u201cas the reconciliation process is concluded.\n\nShe disclosed further that N2.88 trillion went into debt servicing between January and August this year, out of a total expenditure of N8.14 trillion recorded in the first seven months out of 2021.\n\nThe sum of N2.75 trillion was for overhead cost, while N1.75 trillion was expended on capital projects.\n\nAccording to her report, government generated N3.9 trillion so far this year, comprising Company Income Tax (CIT) of N547.5 billion; Value Added Tax collections of N235.7 billion, Customs collections of N338.6 billion and other revenues which amounted to N1.7 trillion.\n\nShe disclosed that with a debt servicing cost of N2.88 trillion and total revenue of N3.9 trillion, the federal government spent about 73 per cent of its revenue on debt servicing within the past eight months.\n\nShe said, \u201cFor the 2021 performance, between January and August, revenue generated was N3.93 trillion which was 73 per cent of the prorated target. Out of this amount, CIT and VAT collections were N547.5 billion and N235.7 billion respectively, representing 121 per cent in the case of CIT and 148 per cent in the case of VAT of the prorated target.\n\n\u201cOn the expenditure side, N8.14 trillion representing 84 per cent of the N9.71 trillion prorated expenditure from January to August had been spent.\n\n\u201cThis performance includes expenditure estimates of Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs), but doesn\u2019t include project tied loans\n\n\u201cOf the expenditure, N2.89 trillion was utilised for debt servicing, while N2.57 trillion was utilised for personnel cost, including pension and gratuities. As at the end of August 2021, N1.75 trillion had been expended on capital projects, of this amount, N1.723 trillion represents 81 per cent of the aggregate provision for Ministries Department Agencies\u2019 capital prorated, while N36.01 billion is expenditure from GOEs.\n\n\u201cSo the story here is that the revenue performance aggregate is 73 per cent but the fact is that the non-oil revenue is performing very well above the target, while the oil and gas revenue are lagging.\u201d\n\nThe finance minister also revealed that the federal government borrowed a total of N3.65 trillion between January and August to finance its N4.3 trillion fiscal deficit, stressing that the balance was covered by privatisation proceeds and drawdown of bilateral and multilateral-tied loans.\n\nOn the proposed N16.39 trillion 2022 aggregate budget proposal, with N10.132 trillion revenue projection and N6.26 trillion fiscal deficit, the minister said N3.60 trillion was for debt service, N6.829 trillion for non-debt recurrent expenditure, and N4.892 trillion for capital expenditure.\n\nAhmed said: \u201cTo promote fiscal transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness, allocations to TETFUND and the budgets of 63 GOEs are integrated in the FGN\u2019s 2022 Budget proposal.\n\n\u201cIn aggregate, 34.9% of projected revenue is to come from oil-related sources while 65.1% is to be earned from non-oil sources.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, N3.331 is projected for oil-related revenue, N1.816 trillion, independent revenue, N924.31 billion from other revenue sources, and N1.728 trillion retained GOE revenue.\n\nThe minister also disclosed that N23 billion \u201cis proposed for Sinking Funds, N768 billion for Statutory Transfer.\u201d\n\nOn the sectors with the highest allocation in 2022, the sum of N2.41 trillion was proposed for Defence, comprising the military, police, intelligence and paramilitary agencies.\n\nInfrastructure (including Works and Housing, Power, among others) comes next with N1.45 trillion, followed by Youth, Women and Social Development with N921 billion.\n\nA sum of N873.93 billion is proposed for the education sector with another N108 billion for the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

My optimism about the future is resounding. Some may wonder how the future will be rescued.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the determination, resilience and the indomitable spirit of Nigerians. I see hope in their resistance when they are pushed to the wall.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the zeal, commitment and courage in the face of adversity. I see hope in the boundless and incurable optimism of young Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the willingness of Nigerian young, who are resisting with all their might the evil that are being perpetrated.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the unwavering conduct and uncompromising drive of Nigerians in demanding a democratic process.

I see hope in the blending of experience, energy and dynamism of the old and the new.\n\n\u201cI see hope in the dynamism, vibrancy and richness of our culture.

Although, he had humble beginnings, he was armed with unyielding resolve as his children had said and he was determined to surmount life\u2019s challenges and he did.\n\n\u201cHe pushed himself to the limits to attain greatness, building an impressive business empire and transforming the lives of numerous people, many of them of Edo origin.\n\n\u201cA trained pilot, he mastered the air quite early in life and searched for the land in the maritime sectors prevailing in all spheres.\n\n\u201cHe embodied hard work, perseverance, dexterity and acumen which espoused his Edo heritage. Captain was a philanthropist who gave lavishly of himself and his resources.\n\n\u201cHe will be remembered for his undying love for Edo people. His desire for the progress and development of our dear state, the Niger Delta region and Nigeria, as well as his invaluable contributions to building bridges across the country will never be forgotten.\n\n\u201cIn building a vast business empire that spanned maritime, logistics, security, transportation, agriculture and hospitality, he displayed rare business acumen, providing employment for thousands of Nigerians and contributing immensely to our nation\u2019s development and progress. He was a devout family man. Undoubtedly, his exit will leave a gaping hole in the hearts of the people he imparted so dearly.\u201d\n\nOn his part, late Okunbo\u2019s first son, Osahon said his father\u2019s life was guided by two principles which he said were love and mercy.\n\nAccording to Osahon, \u201cHis life is a lesson and every chance you have to spend with him; he tells you a story from his experience and from the Bible. I once asked him, \u2018why do you forgive so easily\u2019? There are so many people around him that hurt him very deeply but still he had them around him and he said \u2018my son, do you know the reason God will always deliver my enemies at my feet? It is because God knows I will have mercy upon them.\u2019 He said his two guiding principles were love and mercy; those were the two principles he lived his life by.\n\n\u201cHe told me something in the heat of this cancer problem. He said, \u2018my son, everybody is not supposed to live long. It is not the length of your life, it is about the impact you leave behind. I have always told you people when you were growing up.\u2019 And all of us, from the first to last will testify to this. He will say, \u2018once I have paid your school fees, everything else is jara. I will sell everything I have to enjoy myself.\u2019 That was what he told us growing up.

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu returned quietly to Nigeria on Friday after spending months overseas for medical care.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported his planned return to a \u201cgrand welcome\u201d organised by his political associates\n\nTinubu in London\n\nHowever, due to his inability to stand the rigours of a physical rally, the ex-Lagos governor quietly entered into the country, shunning any fanfare.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that a grand welcome was being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos for the politician.\n\nHowever, top sources confirmed his \u2018early\u2019 return to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cTinubu has quietly returned tonight. He returned quietly but can\u2019t stand the rigours of a physical rally.\n\n\u201cHe arrived on a Falcon jet with registration number VP-CBT. The tracking for the jet is blocked on aviation tracking platforms,\u201d a source disclosed.\n\nIt was also learnt that among those at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos to meet Tinubu was the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the APC chieftain did not get down from his aircraft after his arrival.\n\n\u201cHis passport was stamped from Quits Aviation but he departed from Evergreen hangar at the airport,\u201d a source said.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in Lagos State had sent out a circular to its leaders across the state informing them that the Sunday welcome party being organised for Tinubu would not be held as earlier scheduled.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the APC sent the circular, signed by Alhaji Tunde Balogun (APC State Chairman), and Alhaji Maroun Are (GAC Secretary) to the party leaders believably at the ward and local government levels, without giving a specific reason for the change of plan.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the cancellation was due to the exclusive report published by this medium, which forced them to abort it abruptly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cancelled the police college event meant to welcome Tinubu back to Nigeria. It was due to the expos\u00e9 of the media report by SaharaReporters,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\nIn the circular obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the APC leaders were told that a new arrangement for welcoming Tinubu would be announced later.\n\n\u201cDear leader/GAC member, you are hereby informed of change in plans/arrival of our National Leader billed for Sunday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the plans/arrival have been put on hold. A new plan/arrival will be unfolded soon. Sorry for any inconvenience this hold may have caused. Thank you,\u201d the notice said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu confirmed that he went through a challenging health crisis, saying his \u201cphysiotherapy was gruesome.\u201d\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus who visited him in London last Friday.\n\nThe former governor, who had been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that Fayemi confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity with him.\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever.

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu returned quietly to Nigeria on Friday after spending months overseas for medical care.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported his planned return to a \u201cgrand welcome\u201d organised by his political associates\n\nTinubu in London\n\nHowever, due to his inability to stand the rigours of a physical rally, the ex-Lagos governor quietly entered into the country, shunning any fanfare.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that a grand welcome was being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos for the politician.\n\nHowever, top sources confirmed his \u2018early\u2019 return to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cTinubu has quietly returned tonight. He returned quietly but can\u2019t stand the rigours of a physical rally.\n\n\u201cHe arrived on a Falcon jet with registration number VP-CBT. The tracking for the jet is blocked on aviation tracking platforms,\u201d a source disclosed.\n\nIt was also learnt that among those at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos to meet Tinubu was the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the APC chieftain did not get down from his aircraft after his arrival.\n\n\u201cHis passport was stamped from Quits Aviation but he departed from Evergreen hangar at the airport,\u201d a source said.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in Lagos State had sent out a circular to its leaders across the state informing them that the Sunday welcome party being organised for Tinubu would not be held as earlier scheduled.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the APC sent the circular, signed by Alhaji Tunde Balogun (APC State Chairman), and Alhaji Maroun Are (GAC Secretary) to the party leaders believably at the ward and local government levels, without giving a specific reason for the change of plan.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the cancellation was due to the exclusive report published by this medium, which forced them to abort it abruptly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cancelled the police college event meant to welcome Tinubu back to Nigeria. It was due to the expos\u00e9 of the media report by SaharaReporters,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\nIn the circular obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the APC leaders were told that a new arrangement for welcoming Tinubu would be announced later.\n\n\u201cDear leader/GAC member, you are hereby informed of change in plans/arrival of our National Leader billed for Sunday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the plans/arrival have been put on hold. A new plan/arrival will be unfolded soon. Sorry for any inconvenience this hold may have caused. Thank you,\u201d the notice said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu confirmed that he went through a challenging health crisis, saying his \u201cphysiotherapy was gruesome.\u201d\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus who visited him in London last Friday.\n\nThe former governor, who had been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that Fayemi confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity with him.\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever. That\u2019s not the reason why we went there.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju had just surgery; it is simply proper etiquette or behaviour both in the part of the country where I come from but also generally that when a friend and elder is undergoing health challenges, it would be improper on your part not to show solidarity and support.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also made a surprise visit to Tinubu in London where he was seen leaning on a walking stick.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu underwent knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, US.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it was learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSources close to Tinubu told SaharaReporters that he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan after rumours of his death spread in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTinubu had his second surgery at John Hopkins University in Maryland recently.

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

It could involve gate-crashing events looking to get noticed by a record label or putting in the effort to gain financial or mentorship opportunities \u2014 basically, trying to get the right contacts.\n\nFor most artistes, balancing creativity and business could be an uphill task. While the former could be what someone likes to do, the latter is not always within the control of an artiste.

However, after running for a little above two years and handling rollout for famous clientele, the business has decided to make communications options open to independent artistes at an affordable rate with the launch of its platform, SpinHeard.\n\nWhy SpinHeard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpinHeard is the next frontier for us. We\u2019re trying to automate what we do for a lot of artists,\u201d former music journalist and founder of Nabsolute, Victor Okpala, tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a person who had to stick his neck out in the early days to get someone to bet on his capabilities, Okpala understands the importance of having a viable platform and the right contacts.\n\nStill, he believes that the times have become nicer such that the deal-breaker could just be time and chance. And the likelihood that exposure could come in easier ways has repeated itself as music becomes mainstream with the Internet.\n\nThis Harvard Business Review (HBR) piece makes a bold statement about the power of luck in any business. And Okpala strongly agrees with this, especially in music.\n\nA more recent case is how 17-year-old Salle\u2019s music broke the Internet and attracted huge attention, even from CNN, in less than a month. The young Nigerian\u2019s short performance was captured and posted by someone who\u2019d heard of her talents, and for her, that was all she needed.\n\nBut what are the odds if artistes leave it all to luck?\n\nWhile Nabsolute leverages storytelling, tech tools, and a network of influencers to amplify and market content within the creative industry, Okpala admits that these services might not be affordable for the average independent artist.\n\n\u201cWe know that an agency like Nabsolute is elite, which means there\u2019s a cost that comes with it if you want us to do a job for you.\u201d\n\nFor instance, running an entire campaign for four weeks could cost up to $1,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that is a fee that a lot of independent artistes cannot afford,\u201d Okpala explains, \u201cThis group makes up a large percentage of the industry. This means we have a big market that we can\u2019t help. We needed to extend our solution to more people.\u201d\n\nGiven what this process entails, the burden would be massive on the agency and might not be economical for someone with a lean budget. Hence, a need to automate all these processes on a platform.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a platform that will help independent artistes to break the barrier to music curators \u2014 journalists, OAPs, influencers, DJs \u2014 across all levels.\u201d After all, for him, \u201cevery song deserves a fair chance of being heard.\u201d\n\nHow SpinHeard works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking coverage across different platforms can be a monumental task. Even though the two-year-old business has built a name for itself and has a ready network of \u2018doers\u2019 that can be onboarded, I expressed my worries about the risk of these employees getting a heavier workload for less pay.\n\nAccording to Okpala, SpinHeard comes with incentives for these curators, especially to simplify their jobs. The web app will include tools that will organise and automatically prioritise requests based on release dates, deadlines, genre, regions, and other sorting attributes.\n\nA SpinHeard account can be owned by an artist, a manager, or a curator.\n\nThink of Upwork but for music creators and curators. A platform where artistes can pitch directly to people to get their content across to listeners. What is more significant than an assurance that people will hear them?\n\nThe platform also contains some starter kits that could help artists present their pitches in acceptable formats. This includes press release guides, pitch templates, and press kit templates.\n\nGiven SpinHeard\u2019s value offering, Okpala says the attached costs will be hugely subsidised compared to the standard PR cost. However, since the product is still in its beta phase, the charge is yet to be defined.\n\nBut Okpala makes an interesting case for getting your craft under the radar of an influencer or an OAP with $1, without having to worry about rejection, as long as the quality of the work is good. If the pitch is ignored, there is also a chance to get a refund.\n\nAsides from that, there is an option to pitch for free, with the decision to feature left to the curator\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor starters, SpinHeard will help independent artistes upload their content to the popular video-sharing app, Triller and get promoted for free, of course, after content vetting.\n\nOkpala talks about how this leverages an existing partnership between the social networking platform and Nabsolute. This would expose these independent artistes to the perks the company already offers clients it runs comms for \u2014 in terms of push notifications, banner support, and other home page features.\n\nOkpala confirms that curators will be onboarded later this month; this will arrive along with payment features.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economics of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s in it for Nabsolute.\n\nLike every new venture, profit isn\u2019t the main goal for now. Okpala believes that starting Nabsolute is risk enough, so the initial focus is on onboarding. Sometimes, the reward might have to come from testimonials telling of the impact on the independent artiste who might have gone unheard without a platform like SpinHeard.\n\nStill, as a business, there\u2019s a plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pad the agency service charge into what users pay to the curators through a percentage share. The model is going to be the typical split-share percentage.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is yet to be decided. The company is still in talks with the curator community, and Okpala can\u2019t confirm if these rates and percentage commission would vary from one curator to another.\n\nWhile his expectations aren\u2019t lofty, Okpala speaks of this product as a risk worth taking since it is the first in the industry, and the company would be willing to experience both the first-mover advantage alongside its disadvantages.\n\nWith an initial focus on Nigeria, the platform would ultimately be open to artists across the globe.\n\nOkpala and his love for music and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a music head,\u201d Okpala recalls.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story, so I probe further. After all, loving music doesn\u2019t always translate to being passionate about telling the story behind a song.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with the way music was being released. I felt like there was no storytelling interwoven in the rollout processes, and people could do better. Rollout felt like an afterthought compared to what happens in the US and other countries,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut he could not act on this until he founded Nabsolute, a story to be told later. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about what he did before then.\n\nOkpala opens up about a phenomenal change that a Kanye West song gave him in 2016 during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cThere was a part in the song, titled \u2018Waves\u2019, that felt like somebody was gasping for air,\u201d he pauses to imitate a beat, \u201cand that particular part of the song felt like it was me trying to find expression for something inside me that there were no words for.\u201d\n\nAnd the song helped him break out of what he would later get to know was depression.\n\nBefore officially becoming a journalist with Lagos-based online news and entertainment company, thenet.ng in September 2017, Okpala reviewed songs on his YouTube channel. He often criticised people\u2019s works, holding strong opinions, which he says have become more objective.\n\n\u201cI have always done my thing on YouTube. Documenting music, doing album breakdowns and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut his issue with the lack of storytelling in music rollout lingered in his mind.\n\nWhile working as a reporter, he felt something was missing, and the void needed to be filled. Okpala decided he had to be more active than just writing about music. So, he took a bold step; at that point, he had made quite a name for himself on the entertainment reporting scene.\n\nFor his first shot, he handled a project by Seyi Shay called Electric Package. He happened to be at the album listening event, where he approached her former manager, Kamal Ajiboye, offering to help them do better. He weaved a story around the EP\u2019s release and rolled it out with a mini-documentary that formed the backstory.\n\nThe success of the project gave him the clarity he had always looked for.\n\n\u201cThat was how I knew that what I was going to do next was to run a communications agency.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, he resigned and founded Nabsolute in July. Nabsolute is coined from the phrase, \u2018Not a Basic Solution\u2019, which he lived by while conceptualising what else to do. So far, the company has acquired notable clients like Runtown, Ycee, Reekado Banks, Skales, Darey Art Alade, K1 De Ultimate, among others.\n\nDespite the success recorded with Nabsolute, Okpala doesn\u2019t expect SpinHeard to be a walk in the park. And, in figuring out how to get things done, he and his team will make peace with the outcome.\n\nSo, fingers crossed. What do you think about this product?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder. (L-R) Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat. Source: Supplied\n\nMoroccan B2B eCommerce startup, Chari, has announced the close of a $5 million seed at a $70 million valuation to expand into more African countries.\n\nThe seed funding saw investments from Rocket Internet, Plug and Play, Y Combinator, and Orange Ventures, among others.\n\nWhat does Chari do? The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now. We\u2019ve seen massive funding and acquisitions like MaxAB\u2019s $40 million funding and its purchase of WaystoCap\n\nChari plans to expand into Francophone Africa and offer more financial services.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s failure to recognise fully vaccinated citizens criticised",
          "text": "Fully vaccinated Nigerians returning to the country from overseas are not recognised by the country\u2019s travel protocol, as they have to take PCR tests and self-isolate for seven days.\n\nTravellers have expressed concerns over why the Nigerian government does not recognise the covid-19 vaccine it has administered to its citizens yet asked the United Kingdom to remove the country from travel blacklists on the back of the same vaccines.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that the travel portal filled on entry into Nigeria doesn\u2019t differentiate between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated.\n\nAll travellers are therefore required to self isolate upon arrival for seven to 14 days whether fully vaccinated or not and are asked to make compulsory payment for COVID-19 tests which must be taken seven days after arrival.\n\nRecall that when the United Kingdom (UK) relaxed its COVID-19 vaccine policy for more than 50 countries, Nigeria was initially missing on the list. This met condemnations from the Nigerian government and travellers.\n\nAfter much considerations, the policy was later reviewed to allow fully vaccinated travellers from Nigeria into the UK without needing to provide a pre-departure test, undertake a day 8 test or self-isolate for 10 days, although will still need to book and pay for a day 2 test.\n\nTravellers are therefore worried that the Nigerian government which criticized UK\u2019s initially restrictions are doing the same to its own citizens.\n\nIkechi Uko, travel and tourism expert described Nigeria\u2019s action towards its vaccinated citizens as \u201chypocrisy,\u201d noting that Nigeria demands reciprocity and respect but we do not even offer such privilege to its own citizens.\n\n\u201cIf the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport is not a racket, then Nigeria should at least recognise its own vaccination process.\n\n\u201cThe biggest disincentive for travelling now is the PCR process. The vaccination cards were introduced to ease these logjams but I guess the Nigerian government knows some people will not vaccinate but get the Card. Like we do with a yellow card,\u201d Uko said.\n\nHe said the PCR tests add a lot of stress and cost to travelling now that it is difficult to put together a group tour for a family without contemplating the cost, time and Inconvenience of the tests.\n\nSindy Foster, principal managing partner, Avaero Capital Partners said Nigeria likes to shout about reciprocity when it feels it is the victim of discrimination; any attempt by any country to create policies that they perceive to negatively target Nigerians is rightly frowned upon but when Nigeria is the discriminator, it is silent on that topic.\n\n\u201cThere was uproar on all fronts when the UK Government included Nigeria in the not fully vaccinated category (before the verification of the vaccination certification process). People were calling for Nigeria to reciprocate! But at the time, I pointed out that Nigeria does not recognise any vaccination program from anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference in the travel requirements for fully vaccinated or non-vaccinated in Nigeria yet there were calls demanding Nigerian government retaliate. In reality, it had nothing to do with the vaccine, or Nigerian or not-Nigerian. The policy affected all travellers from Nigeria equally,\u201d Foster said.\n\nWhile the federal government may argue that it is in the public interest for the status quo to remain so they can continue to keep covid-19 in check domestically, BusinessDay\u2019s checks show that Nigeria only has fully vaccinated 1.1 percent of the population to date, whilst the UK has fully vaccinated 67.2 percent of the population.\n\nRead also: Snag for travellers as UK blacklists Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine certificate\n\nFoster said if Nigeria were to reciprocate, there would be no change to non-vaccinated inbound passengers or indeed the payment they collect for inbound fully vaccinated passengers.\n\n\u201cThey currently collect payment of one test fee for inbound passengers. This would remain the same. But the financial burden would be less for the passenger because of not needing to pay for an initial PCR test before departure to Nigeria or UK,\u201d she explained\n\nShe noted that Nigeria would need to look at the demographic profile of the visitors to Nigeria to work out how many would be fully vaccinated, visitors. Given that ethnic minorities are reported to have below-average uptake of vaccines, it is likely it would not have as big an impact on the relaxation of rules for fully vaccinated.\n\nThe UK policy is expected to see an increase in trips from Nigeria to the UK for leisure and business.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, the National President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies, (NANTA), told BusinessDay that discussions are ongoing to recognise fully vaccinated citizens and there will be some reconsiderations on that because if the UK can consider fully vaccinated travellers and remove some requirements for fully vaccinated Nigerians, likewise all other countries should do same.\n\n\u201cThe UK is trying to encourage more travels from Nigeria and the vaccine campaign and Nigeria should do same,\u201d Akporiaye said.\n\nAccording to Seyi Adewale, chief executive officer \u2013 Mainstream Cargo Limited, Nigeria generally operates from the principle of bilateral reciprocity with the UK, however, this is currently being aligned and the latest information via the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), reveals Nigeria is setting up a single portal to verify fully vaccinated Nigerians.\n\nThe UK Consulate is partnering with the responsible local agencies to assist the country to scale up and fast track this (portal) needs through advisory and technical support, Adewale said.",

          "text": "It is often difficult to get a destination with a mix of nature, modernity, adventure, serenity and preservation of cultural heritage. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\u2019s commercial and cultural hub offers these and more.\n\nAs societies evolve, there have been conscious efforts to move with trends and inculcate some intricacies to appeal to the technology-driven generation whilst paying less attention to nature.\n\nHowever, one destination that has made conscious and consistent efforts to not only upgrade its tourism attractions but invest in technology innovations and yet not lose touch with nature and its beauty is Addis Ababa.\n\nNo doubt, Ethiopia is making consistent efforts to promote its inbound tourism by ensuring ease of travel through its quick-to-process visa on arrival, partnership with its major airline, Ethiopian Airlines to give tourists discounted tickets to encourage more travels into the country, resuscitating its major historic events and promoting its tourists attractions. The country has also opened up its new airport terminal in anticipation for an increased passenger traffic in the near future.\n\nNew terminal at Addis Ababa\n\n\n\nEthiopia\u2019s new terminal at Addis Ababa Bole International is the first terminal in the world to be completed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with a foresight to process arriving and connecting passengers as countries open up for travels.\n\nDesigned, with biosafety and biosecurity in mind, the terminal expansion is one of the pillars of Ethiopian Airlines\u2019 vision 2025 as the new terminal plays a key role in passenger and employee safety as the airport experience becomes contactless.\n\nThe new terminal has a check-in hall with sixty check-in counters, thirty self-check-in kiosks, ten self-bag drop/SBD/, sixteen immigration counters with more e-gate provisions, sixteen central security screening areas for departing passengers are the new faces of the airport.\n\nIn addition, it has three contact gates for wide-body aircraft along with ten remote contact gates with people mover \u2013 travelator, escalator, and panoramic lifts.\n\nIt will house thirty-two arrival immigration counters with eight e-gate provisions at the mezzanine floor level.\n\nVisa-on-arrival\n\nThe airport\u2019s visa-on-arrival counters are open 24 hours, processing a passenger\u2019s visa within three to 10 minutes depending on the queue or number of passengers waiting to process their visas.\n\nTo save the hassle of queuing and applying for a visa on arrival, passengers can apply online for an Ethiopian eVisa in advance as almost all nationalities are eligible for the eVisa and the application only takes a few minutes.\n\nSkylight Hotel\n\nAfter a long flight, most times leading to jet lag, there is no better way to relax, have a good meal and enjoy the serenity of Addis better than what Ethiopian elegant 5* skylight hotel offers.\n\nLocated at the heart of Addis Ababa, just five minutes away from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, the airport meets international standards with outstanding quality of service.\n\nThe high rise edifice has a total of 373 stunning rooms with relaxing and superb designs suitable for both corporate and leisure travellers.\n\nTravellers and guests can enjoy spectacular city views in most of the rooms.\n\nSkylight has three luxurious restaurants, an all-day dining restaurant, the biggest Chinese restaurant in East Africa and bars that heighten guests\u2019 hotel experience.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s front lobby is spacious enough for social and business meetings with a grand ballroom that can accommodate 2000 guests at a time.

The hotel welcomes guests to lunch and dinner with a La Carte menu.\n\nAfter experiencing various dishes at the restaurant, one can tell that the hotel has talented chefs skilled at producing a fine selection of foods, including exotic appetizers, healthy salads, fresh pasta and perfectly cooked grills appealing to people from various countries.\n\nRead also: Google, Yemisi Shyllon Museum of Art leverage technology to go global\n\nNational Museum\n\n\n\nPopularly known as the National Museum of Ethiopia (NME), the building houses Ethiopia\u2019s artistic treasures. Containing many precious local archaeological finds such as the fossilized remains of early hominids, the most famous of which is \u201cLucy,\u201d and the partial skeleton of a specimen of Australopithecus afarensis, the museum takes one down history lane.\n\nAt the basement gallery is a display on Selam, found between 2000 and 2004. This archaic fossil is estimated to date to 3.3 million years ago.\n\nThe NME has four main exhibition sections. The basement is dedicated to archaeological and pale anthropological sections. This area shows the previously mentioned hominids. The first floor contains objects from ancient and medieval periods, as well as regalia and memorabilia from former rulers, who include Emperor Haile Selassie.\n\nThe second floor shows art work in a chronological order, from traditional to contemporary works. Afewerk Tekle\u2019s massive African Heritage is one of the most notable pieces. Another painting depicts the meeting of Solomon and Sheba. The second floor also contains a collection of secular arts and crafts, including traditional weapons, jewellery, utensils, clothing and musical instruments.\n\nThe third floor has an ethnographic display. Here, the museum tries to give an overview of the cultural richness and variety of the peoples of Ethiopia.\n\nAt the entrance of the Museum, there are old tortoises moving slowly around the environment.\n\nThe guides are available for free and help to bring things alive and assist guests understand some of the objects displayed at the museum.\n\nTrinity Cathedral\n\n\n\nTrinity Cathedral is also another destination to visit. The Cathedral\u2019s compound is the burial place for those who fought against the Italian occupation, or those who accompanied the Emperor into exile from 1936 to 1941.\n\nHoly Trinity Cathedral is the highest ranking Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo cathedral in Addis Ababa. It was built to honour Ethiopia\u2019s victory over Italian occupation and is the second most important place of worship in Ethiopia, after the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.\n\nThe Emperor Haile Selassie and his consort the Empress Menen Asfaw are buried in the north transept of the cathedral. Other members of the Imperial Family are buried in the crypt below the church. The High Altar of the cathedral is dedicated to \u2018Agaiste Alem Kidist Selassie\u2019.\n\nThe other two altars in the Holy of Holies on either side of the High Altar are dedicated to St. John the Baptist and to \u2018Kidane Meheret\u2019 (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy).\n\nIn the south transept of the cathedral is a chapel of St. Michael, which houses the Tabot or Ark of St. Michael the Archangel, which was returned to Ethiopia in February 2002 after being discovered in Edinburgh.\n\nWorshippers worship at the cathedral on Sundays while those who feel they are not \u2018holy\u2019 enough to enter the auditorium stay outside the auditorium and join in the prayers.\n\nMeskel festival (Finding of the True Cross)\n\nApart from destinations to visit, Ethiopia also has great historic events which are celebrated with so much vigour, showing some level of patriotism for the country. One of such events is the Meskel festival.\n\nMeskel, also known as \u2018Finding of the True Cross,\u2019 is a Christian holiday for the Ethiopian Orthodox and Eritrean Orthodox churches that commemorates the discovery of the True Cross by the Roman Empress Helena in the fourth century.\n\nHeld in Meskel Square and celebrated on 26th of September, this year\u2019s festival was presided over by religious and civil leaders, and public figures gave speeches, referencing biblical themes and stories. Many Ethiopians who live in cities return to their villages to celebrate the national event. The event was also attended by guests from various parts of the world.\n\nA brief event leading to this festival is based on the belief that Queen Eleni, as she is known, had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the True Cross was buried.\n\nSo she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit, the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.\n\nThis is why till date, the Meskel celebration includes the burning of a large bonfire, or Demera.\n\nAccording to local traditions, this Demera-procession takes place in the early evening the day before Meskel or on the day itself. The firewood is decorated with daisies prior to the celebration. Charcoal from the remains of the fire is afterwards collected and used by the faithful to mark their foreheads with the shape of a cross.\n\nKuriftu Resorts\n\nDo you crave for a destination where nature meets class and elegance? Kuriftu resorts offer guests these and more.\n\nAfter a 45-minute drive from Addis Ababa, guests can expect great atmosphere, great weather, peaceful environment and service at its peak.\n\nWith achingly perfect views, Kuriftu Bishoftu is where luxury reaches its pinnacle and service is simultaneously warm, genuine and sensational.\n\nThe nature themed resort could serve as an ideal gate-away for newlyweds, couples, family or friendly break.\n\nYonaiel Belete, Operations Director, Kuriftu Resorts, said the resort was built to mainly take care of the local market within the country because Addis\n\nAbaba was not so attractive when the resort was built as it is now.\n\nBelete noted that the location was actually made for people who live inside Ethiopia but over the years, new innovations and additions have been made to cater for visitors from various parts of the world.\n\n\u201cWith new packages in Addis Ababa, I see a lot of people combining it with our locations. We are not limited in terms of scope because we have to take care of people\u2019s needs in terms of events and others.\n\n\u201cIn future, if everything goes on well especially with the Covid-19 pandemic and with the proper guidelines and if people are comfortable, there is a lot of potential for tourism to grow especially in Addis Ababa,\u201d he explained.\n\nWith 140 rooms, Kuriftu is fast becoming the biggest and most popular boutique lodging chain in Ethiopia. There are currently lodges in Bahir Dar, Bishoftu, and Adama, and each have their own design and unique charm. Kuriftu Resorts provide a welcome dose of comfort along any adventure in Ethiopia.\n\nKuriftu also offers organic spa and gourmet restaurants which are perfect places to relax as guests prepare to continue their getaway experience.\n\nIn addition, Kuriftu Water Park which spans over 30,000 square meters, features a wide range of activities, such as small water house, medium water house, fikat circus, slides, boomerang slide, wave pool, food court and gift shop.\n\nEntoto Mountain Natural Park\n\nAnother must-visit destination in Addis Ababa is the Entoto Mountain Natural Park. Entoto Natural Park is another nature-themed resort and a unique place to discover the vastest primeval mountain area with streams flowing out from clear springs and waterfall.\n\nEntoto park is a unique natural sight in a mountain area for relaxation and pleasure. Located at the north edge of Addis Ababa, the Park is fully delivering services with many indoor and outdoor adventure and recreational activities. The recreational adventure and tourist attraction sights are also open for visitors. The park is suitable for families or group of visitors to cook by themselves and stay at a tented camp.\n\nWonderful adventuress at Entoto Natural Park include food and accommodation services; adventure and recreations activities such as park walking,\n\nMaya telescope view\n\nart gallery, horse riding, tented camp, zipline, pedal kart, paintball arena, archery and trampoline amongst others.\n\nAddis becoming top destination in Africa\n\nAddis Ababa is making deliberate and consistent efforts to make the destination a foremost tourism destination in Africa.\n\nMahlet Kebede, head Ethiopian Holidays said Ethiopian Holidays, a department which handles inbound and outbound packages, and conference market said the department will continue to unveil more packages.\n\nShe said the plan is to have more transit passengers come for a day, two, or up to seven days as ET Holidays continues to make different package combinations depending on the interest of the customer.\n\n\u201cFor passengers that have decided to travel on Ethiopian Airlines, the only thing we have to do is to convince the passengers to stay for a few days in Addis while transiting.\n\n\u201cOur motto is, \u2018One Trip, Two Destinations\u2019. So we would like to make it a pleasant one and we would not be charging any additional fare for the passenger to come and stop here in Addis. With this provision, people will be comfortable to experience seeing Addis and next time they will be full package passengers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe further revealed that she is putting structures in place to ensure that by 2035, ET Holidays would achieve its target of having 10 million inbound tourists.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 2022 Budget: Where is the Money Going?\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of finance, budget and national planning, Zainab Ahmed, made a presentation Friday on how the 2022 budget will be allocated.\n\nHere are the highlights from the presentation:\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s aggregate expenditure for next year, the total money to be spent on salaries, project-tied loans and government owned enterprise is projected to cost N16.39 trillion.\n\nRecurrent (non-debt) spending on items such as repairs and maintenance, operational costs, administrative costs is estimated at N6.83trillion and makes up 41.7% of the total expenditure.\n\nAggregate Capital Expenditure of N5.35trillion is 32.7% of total expenditure. This is made up of spending on Government Owned Enterprises, Capital and Project-tied loans expenditures and Capital component Statutory Transfers.\n\nAt N3.16tn, the repayment of loans or debt servicing gulps 22% of the total expenditure and 35.6% of total revenues.\n\nThe provision to retire maturing bonds to local contractors/suppliers of 292.7 billion is 1.79% of total expenditures. This is to payoff backlog of contractual arrears dating back over a decade.\n\nThe overall budget deficit is N6.26 trillion. This represents 38% of the total budget and 3.39% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria risks N10.82trn deficit in 2022 on unrealistic revenue target\n\nThe deficit will be financed mainly by borrowings from domestic sources (N2.51 trillion), foreign sources (N2.51 trillion), and Multi-lateral/Bi-lateral loan drawdowns (N1.16 trillion).\n\nThe Defence & Security Sector (at N2.41 trillion) takes 15% of Budget. This amount provides for the Military, Police, Intelligence and Para-Military.\n\nInfrastructure which include the provisions for Works, Housing, Power, Transport, Water Resources, and Aviation sectors account for 8.9% of the budget (at N1.451 trillion).\n\nSocial Development & Poverty Reduction Programmes takes 5.3% of the budget (at N863 billion). This is the amount provisioned to cater for Social Investments and Poverty reduction programmes.\n\nThe Health Sector will be allocated 5% of total FGN Budget (at N820.2 billion). From this 5%, N711.28bn is the amount provisioned for Federal Ministry of Health and its agencies. N54.87bn for immunization funds, including Counterpart Funding for Donor Supported Programmes, and Global Funds.

N108.10 billion was earmarked for Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) and N306.00bn will be given to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for infrastructure projects in Tertiary Institutions.\n\nFrom the Minister\u2019s presentation, increase in national expenditure was stimulated by the need to provide for additional and unavoidable critical expenses as well as the need to present an all-inclusive FGN Budget.\n\nAlso, the IMF posits that low income developing countries\u2019 GDP Growth is projected to accelerate by 3.9% in 2021, and 4.9% in 2022.\n\nThese projections indicate global economy will recover from COVID 19 induced contraction in 2021. Growth is projected to be moderate beyond 2022, thus giving a ray of hope for increase in internally generated revenues.\n\nBorrowings are essential for Capital Expenditure and Human Development, as specified in Section 41(1)a of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. The Federal Government resorts to borrowing to finance fiscal gaps with believing that the debt level is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe purpose for the forum was to harness citizen\u2019s participation and feedback to improve the budget for 2022.",

          "text": "Cloud Exchange, a leading system Integrator in West Africa and a provider of end-to-end Information Technology (IT) system solutions, has officially launched Africa\u2019s first uptime institute tier IV modular prefabricated data center in collaboration with telecommunications giant, Huawei.\n\nThe state-of-the-art data center was unveiled on Thursday, September 30, 2021 at a grand ceremony held at the Oriental Hotel in Lagos, Nigeria. The introduction was in line with Cloud Exchange\u2019s expansion of its service offerings from systems integration, hybrid cloud infrastructure to Tier IV data center colocation, interconnects and cross-connects, managed network and security, private and public cloud services.\n\nSpeaking during the event, Chief Executive Officer of Cloud Exchange, Mr Glad Dibetso said Nigeria\u2019s growing digital economy drove the development of the data center.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe tier IV data center vision was born from the burning platform we were on in 2016. We had an audacious vision to build the first African Tier IV Prefabricated data center certified by Uptime Institute. We wanted to be part of the solution by finding tailor-made solutions fit for purpose and pragmatic for the continent.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure, especially in ICT has continued to hold the continent back. We knew that for African to fully participate in the future, we all need to improve ICT infrastructure as it is the bedrock of digitalization.\n\n\u201cWe did not know how we will accomplish the Tier IV dream; however, we had the will which aligned with the quest to do meaningful work; it always seems impossible until it\u2019s done. The effort of our employees, partners, clients, and industry stakeholders have achieved a green Tier IV data center. We not only achieved the best DC internationally, but we also made sure it\u2019s good for the environment. We have built the very first tier IV Data Centre in West Africa, the first green one free of air and noise pollution and one that is also free of the effects of FM200 contamination,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same vein, Adetoyese Oyerinde, Head, Data Centre and Operation at Cloud Exchange West Africa explained that as a customer-centric company, Cloud Exchange realized that the only guarantee for its operation was to go for the highest level of availability threshold obtainable in the world of Data Centers: A tier IV Data Centre, the facility that promises a minimum of 99.995% availability.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis translates into total redundancy, continuous cooling, fault tolerance and unmatchable reliability that has not been witnessed before in sub\u2013Saharan Africa\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the difference between Tier III and Tier IV Data Centre has always been under-emphasized. \u201cIt is all in numbers, a downtime of 96 minutes compared to 26.3 minutes, a lot can happen in 70 minutes, a lot can be lost in 70 minutes and a lot of money can be made in 70 minutes. Tier IV also promises just more than availability, it promises reliability, it promises excellence, it promises adaptability, and all these have been built into the very first Uptime Institute Tier IV Data Centre in West Africa\u201d, he explained.\n\nMr. Eric, who is the deputy MD of Huawei Technologies Company Nigeria Limited, said\u201d Huawei has been delivering top ICT solutions for over 22 years in Nigeria since 1999. For the past 20+ years, Huawei has been providing and supporting our Partners, Customers and Industries with our unique solutions to build the best practices like Cloud Exchange Data Centre\u201d.\n\nHuawei\u2019s solution uses a 3.6-m high cube and complies with a Tier IV Designed Facility. It includes HUAWEI\u2019s high-efficiency modular UPS, PAC and DCIM+ management system. All these advanced facilities are prefabricated in the factory and pretested before delivery. In addition, Huawei provides exclusive factory acceptance tests (FAT) to guarantee reliability and quality. Huawei\u2019s solution takes the modular architecture and supports expansion in a stacking manner. This modular and scalable design allows it to deploy more racks in the same space and reduce the customer\u2019s initial investment. Besides, the design PUE is lower than 1.5, which will bring tangible benefits to Cloud Exchange in the long run. Huawei\u2019s solution also provides a customized facade with high-level finishing.\n\nMr. Eric added \u201cHuawei will keep innovating on our DC solutions especially the prefab modular solution with the concept of one layer one DC, one rack one DC. Along the lines of electrical and electronic together with digital and AI technologies, we do believe the prefab modular solution is going to be well accepted by our clients. we also believe this solution is going to benefit businesses more because it enables: capacity follows network planning; Investment follows business growth\u201d.",

          "title": "Again, President Buhari Vows To Eliminate Violent Crimes",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said the Federal Government will do everything within the ambit of the law to protect citizens from onslaught of criminals, which include insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and politically motivated killings.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday in Kaduna at Passing Out Parade (POP) for Cadets of 68 Regular Course (Army, Navy and Airforce) of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), the President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, assured that more equipment had been received from some friendly nations to improve security operations in the country.\n\nHe said said the government remains focused on its priority of improving security, bolstering the economy and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, our beloved nation Nigeria is facing many security challenges at this period. We continue to face security threats and violent crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and politically motivated killings which threaten our national integration.\n\n\u201cI assure you that this administration will continue to do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all forms of violent crimes that are creating fear and anxiety among the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state in this regard that, we have received new equipment in our fight against any form of insecurity from our friendly countries.\n\n\u201cThese assets will be deployed to accelerate the fight against insecurity in all parts of the country,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that security had assumed priority in governance and public policy in international scheme of affairs.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we introduced a new Landing Ship Tank early this year to replace the first set of naval ship tanks which were decommissioned by the Nigerian Navy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the Landing Ship Tank is expected to bolster the Navy\u2019s Sealift capability and promote our global maritime commerce, peace and safety within the Gulf of Guinea and our maritime neighbourhood,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President said his administration was poised to eliminate the incentives for corruption by addressing some of the remote causes as part of a long-term strategy for a more effective and sustained war on the menace.\n\nHe said improvement of livelihoods of citizens had been going on in partnership with relevant organised private sector.\n\nAccording to him, some of the interventions by government are, \u201cA smart law enforcement; provision of improved access to education that prepares our youths for global competitiveness; provision of quality health services for improved life expectancy and decent and affordable housing, among others.\n\n\u201cIt is the conviction of this administration that ineffective policies for social provisioning must be redressed in our efforts to tackle the fundamental causes of corruption in our society. This is how best to give vent to the much-cherished values of fairness, equity and justice to the people of this nation.\n\n\u201cI must also emphasize here that, for us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous and democratic country that will attract foreign investors we must be law abiding, committed and promoters of peaceful co-existence. This is a collective responsibility which will definitely yield the Nigeria of our dreams,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nBuhari commended the Commandant of the NDA, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, for the infrastructural upgrade in the military institution, and the colourful parade by the cadets of 68 regular course.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens my heart to see the level of infrastructural development in the Academy. It is a clear testament to the vision, dedication and excellence in the best tradition of NDA.\n\n\u201cNigerians acknowledge that the Academy has consistently justified its existence over the years by turning out well trained and disciplined officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria as well as militaries of allied nations.\n\n\u201cThe NDA has over the years trained and graduated military and paramilitary personnel as well as interested civilians seeking postgraduate education. It is therefore not surprising that the Academy has earned a reputation as an outstanding military Academy in Africa. Let me therefore extend my sincere felicitation to the Commandant, staff and gentlemen cadets of the Academy on this memorable occasion,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President, who was the Reviewing Officer, told the graduating Officer Cadets, that the world they were entering was very different from that which confronted many of their predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe contemporary security environment has been described as violent, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\n\n\u201cYou can therefore expect that the missions that you will be tasked to undertake will be similarly complex. Beyond these significant rationales, I am convinced that we have a real stake, and an abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school children are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of their tribe, faith or political beliefs.\n\n\u201cI believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative, but also a fundamental requirement for our collective safety. I am however delighted with the training you have undergone as you have been well-prepared to meet the challenges you will face in the field.\n\n\u201cYou have all been carefully nurtured by competent instructors and staff during your time in this Academy. In the course of your training, you have been subjected to gruelling regimes of exercises, simulations and bespoke programmes that have prepared you for the tasks ahead. On your behalf, I offer heartfelt thanks to everyone here at NDA for the skills, competences and confidence they have embedded in all of you,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nHe appreciated families and friends of the Cadets for standing by the impressive young men and women who were passing out, urging continued love for them in the course of their career and beyond.\n\n\u201cFamily is the backbone of our Armed Forces; it is the heart of everything we do and your support for them has not only allowed them to succeed today, but will help them to flourish and grow in the coming years.\n\n\u201cOfficer Cadets, my hope is that each of you has a rewarding career, full of opportunities and challenges, which will sometimes stretch you to your limits.\n\n\u201cThough we continue to live in an ever changing, chaotic, unpredictable world, your training here will stand you in good stead to meet whatever lies ahead and will help you navigate through good times and hard times, happy times and sad times, so remember to draw on the valuable lessons you have learned here,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also presented awards to cadets that distinguished themselves in academics and various military trainings, and commissioned all the officers.\n\nIn his remarks, the deputy commandant of NDA, Air Vice Marshal A. I. Ahmodu, thanked the President for \u201cunwavering commitment and support for the NDA\u2019\u2019 over many years.",

The immunisation structure in Nigeria is still evolving and it is a very robust structure.\n\n\u201cThere is routine immunisation for children under five years, there are vaccines for polio, measles, pneumococcal disease, and the COVID-19 vaccines; the next one will be a vaccine for malaria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the next two to three years, we need to build the infrastructure further so that it can accommodate the malaria vaccine, flu vaccine, and other vaccines that are coming. The key issue will be the cost, the call chain, the distribution system. The cost of the vaccine will be the fundamental decider for a country with high malaria burden as Nigeria to push this forward.\u201d\n\nHe expressed confidence that the Nigerian government would agree to use the vaccine and in time, work on how it can accommodate it in the whole immunisation programme.\n\n\u201cAll the diseases facing children are preventable. It is very important to look at the statistics; for instance, pneumonia is another problem which is where the pneumococcal disease is being introduced.

          "text": "According to SaharaReporters, the Federal Ministry of Justice, led by Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami, has spent all of its staff costs in the 2021 budget and is now bankrupt and unable to pay its employees\u2019 wages.\n\nSome federal ministry employees informed SaharaReporters that their lives had become increasingly tough due to their inability to pay their financial responsibilities.\n\nThey questioned how Malami and other senior ministry officials could claim to have spent all of their personnel allocations before the end of the fiscal year, claiming that staff morale had plummeted.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Justice was unable to pay us last month\u2019s salary because the ministry has exhausted its budget according to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation. The Accountant-General had written to call the ministry\u2019s attention to it before, but out of Malami and others\u2019 negligence, they didn\u2019t take it serious, because they refused to act on it,\u201d a female worker told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHence, they couldn\u2019t pay our salaries.\u201d\n\nAnother worker in the ministry stated that if the situation was allowed to continue, their productivity would be affected.\n\nHe added that expectedly, many of them were down with rising debts.\n\n\u201cThe personnel cost of the ministry is exhausted. The top officials have lavished the money and have run down the ministry with wasteful spending. We have not got last month\u2019s salary,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of detailed investigations exposed how the Attorney-General of the Federation acquired several properties whose value ran into billions of naira since being appointed by Buhari.\n\nFor example, Malami has an underground hotel in Sokoto, three houses at Peace Estate, Abuja, a brand new state-of-the-art school in Kebbi, two houses for his sons worth N100million each, and a new hotel under construction in the Jabi area of Abuja.\n\nHe also bought a house in 2020 worth N150 million in the Gwarimpa area of Abuja.\n\nPart of Malami\u2019s assets since becoming a minister is also a newly constructed school which is located at the back of NITEL in Gesse Phase 1, Birnin-Kebbi.\n\nA new house worth N600million on Ahmadu Bello Way, Nasarawa GRA, Kano, was acquired by Malami also after becoming a minister.\n\nMalami also built a N3billion multipurpose event centre in Kebbi state named Azbir Arena for his son in Kebbi.\n\nThis is apart from Rayhaan Hotel located on Zaria Road, opposite Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, which the AGF massively upgraded.\n\nEver since SaharaReporters published a series of detailed reports exposing these illicit acquisitions, the online news medium has been a target for the AGF\u2019s camp.\n\nDespite the open display of unexplained wealth by the AGF and members of his family in recent times, President Buhari, who rode to power in 2015 on the back of a promise to crush corruption, especially in the government circle, has yet to offer any statement on the development.\n\nObservers say Buhari\u2019s silence is an endorsement of the atrocities of one of his most trusted lieutenants, Malami.",

          "text": "\u2026South blackmailing North for power shift \u2013 APC chieftain \u2026PDP\u2019ll re-visit Bala-led c\u2019ttee on zoning \u2013 Spokesman \u2026Every country has its own peculiarities \u2013 Olujimi \u2018\u2026Anti-open grazing law\u2019ll protect citizens\u2019 \u2018\u2026VAT being used for North to cede presidency\u2019\n\nAhead 2023 general elections, the battle of wits has started between the North and the South political elite with governors and ethnic champions fanning the embers of dispute. In this report, BODE OLAGOKE, TAIYE ODEWALE, TOPE SUNDAY, SAMSON BENJAMIN and ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU, dug deep into the agitations and the implications.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 17 Southern governors had demanded at a meeting in Lagos that the South should be allowed to take a shot at the presidency in 2023.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cThe Forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region.\u201d\n\nReacting to their position, their counterparts in the North at a meeting in Kaduna, rejected rotational presidency, saying it was against the constitution of the country.\n\nThe chairman of the Forum, the Plateau state governor, Simon Lalong, said, \u201cSome Northern states governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to the three geo-political zones in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South. The statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected President shall:- score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation.\u201d\n\nGloom\n\nSpeaking on the likely danger of jettisoning zoning or otherwise, a political analyst, Towoju Mercy, said ever since Nigeria gained Independence in 1960, there have been issues of tribalism in the Nigerian presidency.\n\nShe said, \u201cPresidency ought to be based on merit and people\u2019s mandate but it\u2019s had turned to a post which a particular tribe is ready to dominate. The presidential seat is not exclusively reserved for a particular group but for those who merit it and those that can hold the mantle of leadership.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of dangers that are about to set in, one of which is inter-regional or inter-tribal clash. I think it\u2019s high time the Northerners should take a shift from the presidential seat and allow the southern region to enjoy the benefit of being a part of Nigeria. The fact is that it should be accepted that we are divided so let each tribe showcase what they are up to and the package they have for the country.\u201d\n\nAnother political commentator, Success Ohia, said any attempt to jettison the zoning\u2019s unwritten agreement will only further fuel secession agitations and which will endanger the already fragile unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI foresee a great danger in the country, because, it will not be in the interest of the country for the north to hold on to power in 2023, because doing so would be to the detriment of the fragile unity of the country, which is against the constitution in section 15(1) which states that \u2018the motto of the federal republic of Nigeria shall be unity and faith, peace, and progress.\u2019\n\nIn his view, a political scientist and lecturer in the department of political science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Femi Fayomi, noted that the development might lead to a complicated outcome in the ongoing tussles between the regional governors.\n\n\u201cInfact, it\u2019s looking increasingly like this would be a major test and hiccup to our federalism because some certain parts of the geo-political zones are yet to serve in the highest seat of the nation. Consequently, by zoning to other regions other than such regions will ignite and fuel the marginalisation outcry which will be another cog in the wheel of progress of the nation\u2019s development and unity.\n\n\u201cAlso, if we are to look beyond primordialism, I think if any region can present aspirants with proven integrity, records and antecedents good enough to paddle the ship of the nation without any form of fear or bias toward any region. Going by our history, one can easily deduce that ethnicity has done more harm than good to our development taking into consideration failure to adhere to federal character principle in the various political appointments made by the government which has limited the input of other regions hence fuelling the ideology of Right to Rule by a certain region.\n\n\u201cI think the major political parties can make a decisive action towards presenting the best candidate from the geo-political zone that has yet to serve in such capacity to also contest since it\u2019s not that those regions are short of human resources and intellectual capacity to improve the country\u2019s various spheres.\u201d\n\nVAT, open-grazing, restructuring\n\nAside from the agitations for power rotation, the controversial issues of Value Added Tax (VAT) and the open-grazing law have also become tools for negotiation in the hands of politicians, which analysts have said pose danger for the continued peaceful existence of the country.\n\nAs agreed by the Southern governors at their Lagos meeting, most Southern states have enacted laws against open-grazing in the region. This action is also considered a move against the Northern Fulani who are culturally cattle rearers and in the business of moving their cattle about.\n\nSome commentators, however, believe that the growing move against open- grazing of cattle and that of allowing states to collect VAT have been spurred by the body language of the government at the centre which appears to favour the Northern Protectorate.\n\nAgitations for the restructuring of the country in a way that powers are devolved to the regions and states have been on the table for years now with those championing the cause predominantly from the South which makes it look suspicious to the North. Restructuring, as a Southern agenda, is seen by Northern stakeholders as an agenda against their region with the highest voting population.\n\nA security expert\u2019s view\n\nA security expert, Chinedu Okafor, in his reaction, told this reporter that if not politicised, the governors\u2019 decision to ban open-grazing has the potential of curbing farmers\u2019, herders\u2019 violence in across the country. According to him, the ban may have both positive and negative effects.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn one hand, it will definitely reduce the issue of criminal herdsmen kidnapping because the alibi of staying in the forest in the guise of rearing cattle will no longer be there as a cover. More so, it will also put a stop to the herders, farmers\u2019 crises in the South, North and the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if no compromise is reached between the northern governors and their southern colleagues on this issue, it could lead to another bigger crisis altogether. This is besides the Fulani\u2019s expected revolt should the plan come into action. Every side needs to tread softly.\n\n\u201cAside from deaths of different individuals, it has also led to loss of property worth millions of Naira and food shortages due to the neglect of farm lands and destruction of crops.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the executive director of Global Rights Network, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Hafeez Babatunde, said such a legal instrument is needed to stop the menace of herders, farmers\u2019 clashes in the southern part of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cGovernors of the states where the law is yet to take off must be reminded that the anti-open grazing law is undoubtedly the only legal route to protect their people from insidious attacks by criminal herders. It is a timely warning that mere rhetoric and grandstanding cannot curb the killer herders\u2019 wanton campaign of destruction of farms and kidnappings across the southern states.\u201d\n\nFor a former House of Representatives member, Aminu Sani Jaji, the controversy surrounding the collection of VAT is being used to compel the North to cede the presidency to the South in 2023.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen in Abuja, the Zamfara state-born chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) said the North stands to gain bountifully in the long run if states are allowed to reap from the VAT generated in their respective domain.\n\nJaji, who expressed reservations over zoning, however, admitted that rotational presidency would enhance national unity and cohesion in the country.\n\n\u201cEven the issue of VAT or fiscal federalism that people are talking about, all these are because of 2023. They feel the only way they can get the presidency or mandate is through intimidation. It will not work. You can only win somebody\u2019s heart by being polite and friendly. But so long as you continue to pursue somebody with a sort of intimidation with what you have, trying to use your own force, nobody will take it.\n\n\u201cMy take is that whosoever wants to be the president, let the person come and showcase to all Nigerians where he is from the North or South how he wants to be a president. Politics is a game of numbers. There is no way you can take away that word from politics. It must be the number.\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people sit down and talk about zoning, it is about sentiment. In politics, you don\u2019t zone everything. But it\u2019s because we are not yet mature and advanced that the issue of zoning is coming up.\n\n\u201cI think the issue of zoning always comes up because we want to remain as one. Because the political diversity we have today was because of the regional politics we have been playing all the time since 1999 till date.\u201d\n\nAs far as a former governor of Nasarawa state and the lawmaker representing Nasarawa West in the Senate, Abdullahi Adamu, is concerned, the right to field a presidential candidate solely rests with political parties.\n\n\u201cThose nursing the idea of zoning or rotational presidency should jettison it since it is not provided for by the 1999 Constitution. No part of the Nigerian constitution provides for zoning or rotation of political offices, meaning that for anybody to become president must be ready to go through the ballot box.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just whisk away a position that is fundamental to the life of a country. You can\u2019t talk of merit and talk of zoning. The issue of rotation, let\u2019s just go by merit. Let every party find a way of selling itself in a manner as to garner the kind of votes to deliver the presidential result. It is as simple as that,\u201d he said.\n\nConvention\n\nIn her reaction, a PDP senator representing Ekiti South, Biodun Olujimi, said people tend to mix up the issue of zoning and rotational presidency.\n\nShe said zoning in political parlance may not be written or recommended anywhere in the constitution but the principles of Federal Character are enshrined in the constitution.\n\n\u201cAs provided for by the principle of federal character, public offices cannot be occupied or dominated by one section of the country at the exclusion of others, which made political parties in Nigeria right from the first republic to reflect federal character in their compositions as far as membership and executives are concerned and even as far as public offices are concerned for anyone of them in power.\n\n\u201cRotational presidency on the other hand is more of convention anchored on gentlemanly agreement written or unwritten between the North and the South in addressing the peculiarities of the country called Nigeria. This debate as regards where power should shift to in 2023 between political actors from the South and the North is unnecessary going by the already analysed trend from 1999 till date.\n\n\u201cEvery country has its own peculiarities, rotational presidency between the North and the South is one of the ways of addressing the peculiarities of a highly diversified entity called Nigeria, and there should be no heated debate or argument across the divides on it.\u201d\n\nPGF boss\u2019 warning\n\nIn his reaction, the director-general of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, has warned that moves by some leaders in the APC to push negotiation for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate for 2023 elections outside the structures of the party is a threat to internal unity among APC members and leaders.\n\nHe also canvassed for a strong and functional internal consultative mechanism to address differences and disputes between APC-controlled governments in the interest of the party.\n\nBlaming the development on what he called \u201cexcessive politicisation\u201d in a statement titled: \u201cAPC and struggle for New Nigeria\u201d in Abuja, the APC chieftain said campaign and negotiation for power shift should be carried out within the party structures.\n\nHe said, \u201cPart of the challenge of excessive politicisation is that it also threatens the internal unity of APC members and leaders. For instance, excessive politicisation in the country is influencing the decision of some APC leaders to push negotiation for the emergence of the party\u2019s Presidential Candidate for 2023 elections outside the structures of the APC.\n\n\u201cThis is now threatening the unity of leaders of APC. Around the whole question of power shift, some leaders of the APC have gone outside the structures of the party to mobilise support for the party to zone its presidential candidate for 2023 to the Southern part of the country.\u201d\n\nPDP spokesman\u2019s view\n\nWhile the APC is yet to decide on zoning, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has disclosed that its national executive committee (NEC) \u201cshall at a later date revisit Governor Bala Mohammed committee\u2019s recommendation on zoning.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of PDP Zoning Committee, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu state last week recommended that \u201cconsequently, the current offices being held by officers in the Southern zones of the country, namely; South-west, South-east and South-south zones, should swap places with the offices currently in the northern zones of Nigeria, namely, North-west, North-east and North-central zones.\u201d\n\nBefore the Ugwuanyi\u2019s committee, the Governor of Bauchi state, Senator Bala Mohammed-led committee to review party\u2019s performance in 2019 had earlier recommended that the 2023 presidential ticket be thrown open.\n\nBut briefing the newsmen after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the party\u2019s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the NEC has unanimously adopted the Ugwuanyi committee report on zoning of the party\u2019s national offices.\n\nOn the 2023 presidency, Ologbondiyan said NEC \u201cshall at a later date revisit Governor Bala Mohammed committee\u2019s recommendation on zoning.\u201d\n\nCalculations\n\nDespite the regional and ethnic political calculations, event watchers believe that when the chips are down some of the governors in the forefront of the regional interest will be forced to dance to the tunes of their political parties, bearing in mind that only political parties have the constitutional powers to present presidential candidates.",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday said improving security, the economy and fighting corruption are still the core priorities of his administration, six years after the triad of promises first won him the presidential election.\n\nThe President made the remark in Kaduna at the Passing Out Parade for Cadets of 68 Regular Course (Army, Navy and Airforce).\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, our beloved nation Nigeria is facing many security challenges at this period. We continue to face security threats and violent crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and politically motivated killings which threaten our national integration,\u201d he said, according to a statement signed by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu.\n\n\u201cI assure you that this administration will continue to do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all forms of violent crimes that are creating fear and anxiety among the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state in this regard that, we have received new equipment in our fight against any form of insecurity from our friendly countries.\n\n\u201cThese assets will be deployed to accelerate the fight against insecurity in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that security had assumed priority in governance and public policy in international scheme of affairs.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we introduced a new Landing Ship Tank early this year to replace the first set of naval ship tanks which were decommissioned by the Nigerian Navy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the Landing Ship Tank is expected to bolster the Navy\u2019s Sealift capability and promote our global maritime commerce, peace and safety within the Gulf of Guinea and our maritime neighbourhood.\u201d\n\nThe President said the administration was poised to eliminate the incentives for corruption by addressing some of the remote causes as part of a long-term strategy for a more effective and sustained war on the practice.\n\nHe said improvement of livelihoods of citizens had been going on in partnership with relevant organized private sector.\n\nAccording to him, some of the interventions by government are: \u201cA smart law enforcement; provision of improved access to education that prepares our youths for global competitiveness; provision of quality health services for improved life expectancy and decent and affordable housing, among others.\n\n\u201cIt is the conviction of this administration that ineffective policies for social provisioning must be redressed in our efforts to tackle the fundamental causes of corruption in our society. This is how best to give vent to the much-cherished values of fairness, equity and justice to the people of this nation.\n\n\u201cI must also emphasize here that, for us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous and democratic country that will attract foreign investors we must be law abiding, committed and promoters of peaceful co-existence. This is a collective responsibility which will definitely yield the Nigeria of our dreams.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari commended the Commandant of the NDA, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, for the infrastructural upgrade in the military institution, and the colourful parade by the cadets of 68 regular course.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens my heart to see the level of infrastructural development in the Academy. It is a clear testament to the vision, dedication and excellence in the best tradition of NDA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigerians acknowledge that the Academy has consistently justified its existence over the years by turning out well trained and disciplined officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria as well as militaries of allied nations.\n\n\u201cThe NDA has over the years trained and graduated military and paramilitary personnel as well as interested civilians seeking postgraduate education. It is therefore not surprising that the Academy has earned a reputation as an outstanding military Academy in Africa. Let me therefore extend my sincere felicitation to the Commandant, staff and gentlemen cadets of the Academy on this memorable occasion.\u201d\n\nThe President, who was the Reviewing Officer, told Graduating Officer Cadets, that the world they were entering was very different from that which confronted many of their predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe contemporary security environment has been described as violent, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\n\n\u201cYou can therefore expect that the missions that you will be tasked to undertake will be similarly complex. Beyond these significant rationales, I am convinced that we have a real stake, and an abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school children are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of their tribe, faith or political beliefs.\u201d",

If he fails to do that, the law will take its course, fully. 2Baba will not dissipate energy engaging Brymo in media exchanges.

          "text": "Ethiopian troops and allied forces have intensified air and ground operations against Tigrayan forces in the northern region of Amhara, according to reports.\n\nThe bombardments hit several areas of Amhara on Thursday and Friday, humanitarian sources told AFP news agency, amid growing speculation of a major push by government forces against the Tigrayan forces.\n\nGetachew Reda, spokesman for the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), told AFP there is a \u201cmassive move\u201d against the Tigrayan forces, which have been locked in a brutal conflict with pro-government troops in northern Ethiopia for more than 11 months.\n\nGetachew said there had been \u201cmostly air, drone and artillery bombardment\u201d of TPLF rebels, and reported a major troop build-up, saying \u201ctens of thousands are amassed\u201d in northern parts of Amhara including the North Gondar and North Wollo zones.\n\nSeparately, Getachew told Reuters news agency the air raids were clustered around three areas: near the towns of Wurgessa, Wegel Tena and on the road linking the region of Afar to Amhara. A diplomatic source confirmed to Reuters that there had been air raids near Wurgessa.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we will thwart the offensive in all fronts and more,\u201d Getachew said. \u201cWe will stand our ground until the siege is lifted.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from Amhara, as well as federal and military officials, did not respond to requests from news agencies for comment about the reported military operations, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe reports come just days after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was sworn in for a new term on Monday, promising to stand strong and defend \u201cEthiopia\u2019s honour\u201d despite mounting international criticism of the conflict and alarm about the humanitarian crisis it has triggered.\n\nThe war erupted in November when the prime minister sent troops into Tigray to remove the TPLF, the regional ruling party that dominated national politics until Abiy came to power in 2018, a move he said came in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF said the federal government and its allies, including Eritrea, launched a \u201ccoordinated attack\u201d against it.\n\nAlthough government forces quickly took control of Tigray\u2019s cities and towns, the TPLF recaptured most of the region including the capital, Mekelle, by late June. Fighting has since spread to the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions, and caused what the United Nations has called an \u201cimmense humanitarian crisis\u201d with hundreds of thousands of people driven into famine-like conditions.\n\nThousands of civilians have been killed, nearly two million have been displaced, and there have been many reports of atrocities including massacres and mass rape.\n\nThere has been speculation that the fighting could pick up now that the rainy season is ending, and with mass mobilisation throughout the country and in Amhara in particular.\n\nOn Thursday, Amhara spokesperson Gizachew Muluneh tweeted, \u201cIn order to liberate our people who are suffering due to the terrorist TPLF, there might be irreversible operations in all fronts, at any time or hour.\u201d\n\nLast week, Abiy\u2019s government expelled seven senior UN officials from Ethiopia for \u201cmeddling\u201d in the country\u2019s affairs, exacerbating concerns about the humanitarian response in Tigray.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres, who has said more than five million people need humanitarian assistance, on Wednesday urged the Ethiopian authorities to allow the UN to deliver aid \u201cwithout hindrance\u201d.\n\nTigray is under a de facto blockade that is preventing most aid from getting in, according to the UN.

          "text": "One of 2021\u2019s most anticipated bouts will roar into action in Las Vegas on Saturday as heavyweights Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder meet for a third time.\n\nBritain\u2019s Fury will defend his WBC crown against the American, who he stopped in the seventh round during their second fight 20 months ago.\n\nIt was Wilder\u2019s first defeat of a 44-fight professional career and sparked him into accusing Fury of cheating.\n\n\u201cDeep down in his soul, he knows he lost and he\u2019ll lose again,\u201d said Fury.\n\n\u201cAfter this fight, he\u2019ll be back working in that fast food chain that he was working at earlier on in his career. It\u2019s retirement for him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in denial and you\u2019re getting knocked out. Do yourself a favour and retire \u2013 your legacy\u2019s in bits, all the excuses, you\u2019ve been destroyed. No one\u2019s even believed you, everyone\u2019s laughing at you. You\u2019re a weak man.\u201d\n\nIn the weigh-in both were the heaviest they have been for a professional fight with Fury at 125kg and Wilder coming in at 107kg.\n\nThere was no face-off as usual, with promoter Bob Arum having said he felt the process treats fighters like \u201canimals\u201d and that he did not want them getting hurt before their bout.\n\nThe pair first met in December 2018 in a bout that ended in a controversial draw, but Fury was rewarded for taking the fight to his opponent last time out.\n\nAfterwards, Wilder blamed the weight of his ring walk costume for draining his energy but also suggested Fury\u2019s gloves were tampered with.\n\nSince then, the 35-year-old has parted ways with coach Mark Breland, who threw in the towel against Fury, and brought in former heavyweight opponent Malik Scott.\n\n\u201cI ask the question, if I only won because I cheated, what was the point of changing everything and doing all this other work?\u201d said Fury in a heated final news conference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care because obviously it\u2019s coming from an unwell person. He accused me of everything: His team, his trainer, the suit, injuries, the State Athletic Commission of Nevada, the referee.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019d have come out with one of these excuses, it would have been believable but not 50 of them. He can believe what he wants, what it tells me is that he\u2019s a weak person who I\u2019m going to knock spark out on Saturday night.\u201d\n\nFollowing the coronavirus pandemic, Fury was set to take on Anthony Joshua \u2013 who has since lost his belts to Oleksandr Usyk \u2013 in an all-British undisputed contest in the summer.\n\nBut Wilder\u2019s team took their case for a rematch clause to court and an arbitration ruling stated Fury had to fight the Alabaman again.\n\nThe trilogy bout was then delayed in July after Fury contracted coronavirus, meaning one year, seven months and 18 days after they last entered the ring the pair will finally meet again on Saturday.\n\n\u201cDeontay\u2019s dream is to get this match and I don\u2019t usually act arrogant, but I do believe Deontay is going to knock him out this time,\u201d Wilder\u2019s manager Shelly Finkel told the BBC\u2019s 5 Live Boxing podcast.\n\n\u201cThere is no rematch, this is it \u2013 anything is open to negotiation. After the fight, I don\u2019t think Fury will want any more of Deontay \u2013 but if he does and we can\u2019t get Joshua or Usyk because they are fighting each other, who knows? But my gut is we will have seen the last of each other.\u201d\n\nFormer undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis believes Fury is the better boxer and is backing him to win if the fight goes the distance \u2013 but if it comes down to a knockout, he is going for Wilder.\n\n\u201cI believe that Tyson Fury has a lot more tools and weapons that he can use in his arsenal,\u201d he told BBC Sport.\n\n\u201cI think if Deontay went back and learned a couple of tricks he can put to use, he\u2019ll have a good time in there as well. So all around, it is going to be a good fight.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Frank Bruno, who won the WBC heavyweight title in 1995, is confident his fellow Briton can get the job done.\n\n\u201cI think Tyson won\u2019t just beat him again \u2013 he\u2019s a much better boxer than Wilder and he\u2019ll school him,\u201d said Bruno.\n\n\u201cFury will be going in nearly five stone heavier than Wilder and, if he boxes smart, and wears him down, that will make a big difference.\n\n\u201cBut you have to be wary of Wilder\u2019s windmill punch. He\u2019s got a big punch, not much else, but you have to give him a puncher\u2019s chance.\n\n\u201cAs long as Tyson Fury doesn\u2019t get involved with this guy, a very dangerous hard puncher\u2026 don\u2019t get stupid. This guy\u2019s got pure power but nothing else.\n\n\u201cI think Tyson\u2019s got it under control. I hope so. I think Tyson Fury will knock him out.\u201d\n\nIn new trainer Scott, Wilder has brought in someone he says he \u201cloves deeply\u201d and makes it a \u201cfamily team\u201d but also someone he defeated in a first-round knockout in 2014.\n\n\u201cI am a student of boxing, Deontay ruled the division and was using one weapon but sometimes two or three,\u201d said Scott.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched him in the gym for 10 years, sparring guys from different walks of life stylistically, and watched him be creative but when he gets in the fight, he\u2019ll use just one or two tools.\n\n\u201cHe got content using one weapon to knock people out \u2013 I went into his tool box and made sure we drilled it over and over again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have him doing choreographed pad work, ducking down to the ground \u2013 he is fighting a tall guy. I don\u2019t want my fighter catching punches, I want him to slip punches, parry punches.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more dynamic, more open-minded and this is the best Deontay Wilder people are going to see.\u201d\n\nTwo-time world heavyweight champion Joshua said he was \u201cnot too bothered\u201d who won this bout but tipped Wilder for a knockout. However, British fans have been longing to see him face off against Fury.\n\nJoshua\u2019s loss to Usyk complicates matters further, with the winner on Saturday likely to want a chance to unify the division by fighting the Ukrainian.\n\nLewis, the last man to hold all the heavyweight belts at the turn of the century, believes Fury\u2019s goal is \u201cbecoming undisputed heavyweight champion of the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe he will go for Usyk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Joshua fight will always be there but Usyk is there and that\u2019s the ultimate goal right now, to get all the belts.\n\n\u201cJoshua is part of the top five, top six, so he can fight any of those guys.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that the fight never came when they were champions, I think people are still excited by that fight, want to see that match up and still want to see who will win.\u201d",

          "text": "A national population and housing census, which was last held in Nigeria 15 years ago, will hold in the country next year, thanks to the N178.09 billion approved for the exercise in the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who made the disclosure during the public presentation and breakdown of Budget 2022 in Abuja on Friday, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari would make a proclamation on the planned 2022 headcount soon.\n\nAhmed explained that the recent review of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was motivated by a number of factors, including the need to provide the funds for the headcount.\n\nThe last population census held in 2006, puts the nation\u2019s population at 140 million people, but was plagued by political interference, from design through to implementation.\n\nSince then, Nigeria has not conducted a population census, relying on estimates from Worldometre, an arm of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\nIn December 2020, the National Population Commission (NPC) announced that an estimated 206 million people were living in Nigeria, an increase of eight million people in two years, against the 198 million it announced in 2018.\n\nThe finance minister also revealed an additional N100 billion in the 2022 Budget estimates to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) prepare for the conduct of the 2023 general elections.\n\nGiving further insight into why the MTEF was reviewed, the minister said the increase in the expenditure side was also motivated by the need to provide for additional critical expenditures, as well as the need to present a more comprehensive FGN Budget.\n\nOther critical expenditures in the 2022 budget estimates include N400 billion for National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy; N50 billion Police Operations Fund; and N37 billion additional provision for debts accruing from the electricity bills of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).\n\nThe minister further disclosed that N517.5 billion was proposed as additional Multi-lateral/Bi-lateral Project-tied Loans; N54 billion for the National Agency for Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), which represents 1% FGN Share of Federation Account; and N305.99 billion for TETFUND (funded by the Education Tax).\n\nAhmed said the fiscal numbers were preliminary and would be updated \u201cas the reconciliation process is concluded.\n\nShe disclosed further that N2.88 trillion went into debt servicing between January and August this year, out of a total expenditure of N8.14 trillion recorded in the first seven months out of 2021.\n\nThe sum of N2.75 trillion was for overhead cost, while N1.75 trillion was expended on capital projects.\n\nAccording to her report, government generated N3.9 trillion so far this year, comprising Company Income Tax (CIT) of N547.5 billion; Value Added Tax collections of N235.7 billion, Customs collections of N338.6 billion and other revenues which amounted to N1.7 trillion.\n\nShe disclosed that with a debt servicing cost of N2.88 trillion and total revenue of N3.9 trillion, the federal government spent about 73 per cent of its revenue on debt servicing within the past eight months.\n\nShe said, \u201cFor the 2021 performance, between January and August, revenue generated was N3.93 trillion which was 73 per cent of the prorated target. Out of this amount, CIT and VAT collections were N547.5 billion and N235.7 billion respectively, representing 121 per cent in the case of CIT and 148 per cent in the case of VAT of the prorated target.\n\n\u201cOn the expenditure side, N8.14 trillion representing 84 per cent of the N9.71 trillion prorated expenditure from January to August had been spent.\n\n\u201cThis performance includes expenditure estimates of Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs), but doesn\u2019t include project tied loans\n\n\u201cOf the expenditure, N2.89 trillion was utilised for debt servicing, while N2.57 trillion was utilised for personnel cost, including pension and gratuities. As at the end of August 2021, N1.75 trillion had been expended on capital projects, of this amount, N1.723 trillion represents 81 per cent of the aggregate provision for Ministries Department Agencies\u2019 capital prorated, while N36.01 billion is expenditure from GOEs.\n\n\u201cSo the story here is that the revenue performance aggregate is 73 per cent but the fact is that the non-oil revenue is performing very well above the target, while the oil and gas revenue are lagging.\u201d\n\nThe finance minister also revealed that the federal government borrowed a total of N3.65 trillion between January and August to finance its N4.3 trillion fiscal deficit, stressing that the balance was covered by privatisation proceeds and drawdown of bilateral and multilateral-tied loans.\n\nOn the proposed N16.39 trillion 2022 aggregate budget proposal, with N10.132 trillion revenue projection and N6.26 trillion fiscal deficit, the minister said N3.60 trillion was for debt service, N6.829 trillion for non-debt recurrent expenditure, and N4.892 trillion for capital expenditure.\n\nAhmed said: \u201cTo promote fiscal transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness, allocations to TETFUND and the budgets of 63 GOEs are integrated in the FGN\u2019s 2022 Budget proposal.\n\n\u201cIn aggregate, 34.9% of projected revenue is to come from oil-related sources while 65.1% is to be earned from non-oil sources.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, N3.331 is projected for oil-related revenue, N1.816 trillion, independent revenue, N924.31 billion from other revenue sources, and N1.728 trillion retained GOE revenue.\n\nThe minister also disclosed that N23 billion \u201cis proposed for Sinking Funds, N768 billion for Statutory Transfer.\u201d\n\nOn the sectors with the highest allocation in 2022, the sum of N2.41 trillion was proposed for Defence, comprising the military, police, intelligence and paramilitary agencies.\n\nInfrastructure (including Works and Housing, Power, among others) comes next with N1.45 trillion, followed by Youth, Women and Social Development with N921 billion.\n\nA sum of N873.93 billion is proposed for the education sector with another N108 billion for the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",
