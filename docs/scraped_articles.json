          "text": "\u2022 List: Imported rice, 10 bags; local rice, 20 bags; beans, 20 bags; Maggi, 10 cartons; 10 kegs of oil\n\n\u2022 PTA, school raise fund, items ready for delivery, bandits\u2019 call being awaited, prayers hold today\n\nThe parents and management of the Bethel Baptist High School, Maraban Rido, Kaduna State, have raised money to buy foodstuffs being demanded by abductors of the 121 students of the school.\n\nA father of one of the abductees, who spoke to one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity on Thursday, said the school asked parents to pay any amount they could afford.\n\nAccording to him, there was panic among the parents when they heard that the bandits threatened to starve the students if the items were not provided.\n\nThese came to the fore on Thursday as The PUNCH learnt that the bandits contacted the school management on Wednesday evening and specified the quantity of foodstuffs they wanted.\n\nAn official, who confided in one of our correspondents, said the bandits said the parents must supply 30 bags of rice, 20 bags of beans and 10 kegs of palm oil.\n\nRecall that the bandits had at 1am on Monday invaded the school and kidnapped 121 students, who are mostly in Senior Secondary School 2 and 3.\n\nThe PUNCH on Tuesday reported that the bandits contacted the school management and demanded food to feed the abductees.\n\nThe Vice-Principal of the school, Wakili Madugu, during an interview on Nigeria Info Abuja 95.1FM on Thursday, which was monitored by The PUNCH, confirmed the quantity of food the bandits were demanding.\n\nMadugu said the gunmen rejected nine bags of rice as well as other food items offered by the school.\n\nMadugu said he received a call at 7.30am on Tuesday shortly after the students had been abducted and was assured of their safety.\n\nHe further stated that the bandits said authorities had blocked their access to food and therefore demanded that the school and the parents make food items available.\n\nThe vice-principal stated, \u201cThey said we should bring 10 bags of imported rice, 20 bags of local rice, 20 bags of beans and then 10 cartons of Maggi (seasoning) and then 10 kegs of oil as well as two bags of salt. These were the items they demanded.\u201d\n\nMadugu, however, said the school did not have all the items demanded because it had exhausted almost all their foodstuffs ahead of the school\u2019s closure this week.\n\nBut the father of one of the abducted students said the school had appealed to parents to donate money which would be used to buy the foodstuffs.\n\nThe man stated, \u201cThe school has asked us to donate any amount we can afford. It is not compulsory but many parents are eager to pay because the bandits threatened to starve the children. There are fears among parents when they heard that the hoodlums threatened to starve the students.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday evening, a source in the school said the foodstuffs had been bought and that the telephone call from the bandits was being awaited.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cWe are waiting for their (bandits) call now to know where they want us to deliver the foodstuffs to them.\n\n\u201cWe (management) have bought the rice and other foodstuff (food items). We are waiting for the call from them (bandits) for direction for where we will meet. We have been waiting for their calls since morning. We have bought all the foodstuffs and all is set. The school didn\u2019t make it mandatory for parents to pay, but some of them volunteered to give for the purchase of the foodstuffs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, all parents would dress in black attire today (Friday) for a special prayer session that will last for four hours.\n\n\u201cThere will be special prayers tomorrow and all of parents are going to wear black attires to last for four hours,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019ve become helpless under this regime, says ACF\n\nMeanwhile, the apex socio-cultural organisation in the North, the Arewa Consultative Forum, has said it has become helpless in the face of growing insecurity in the region.\n\nIt said while it was not opposed to dialogue as a way of seeking for a solution to the banditry and sheer criminality in the North, it was totally against the payment of ransom.\n\nPublicity Secretary of the ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, said this in a telephone interview with The PUNCH, in Abuja, on Thursday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese abductions have certainly taken a toll on not only education but also the economy of the North. As a group of patriotic Nigerians who are northerners, it is glaring to everyone that the fact that we have a President from this region, we are not having the best of times.\n\n\u201cWe believe in dialogue because a sizable number of the people doing this are Nigerians. Let us treat those involved in crime the way criminals are dealt with, those with genuine cases who desire to be heard should be heard.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening has affected us badly. Parents are no longer taking their children to schools; farmers no longer go to the farms for fear of being killed or kidnapped.\n\n\u201cSometimes we wonder whether the President or the Presidency read our statements because nothing appears to have changed.\n\n\u201cThere was a time Mr President said the kidnapping we saw the last time was going to be the last but since then, kidnappings have increased, we are really afraid of what is happening to the north.\u201d\n\nAsked what the ACF was doing or planning to do to stem the tide, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t control the army, police or any of the security services. All we can do is to continue to draw attention to the problem. There are people elected to deal with such issues, we expect them to rise to the occasion.\n\n\u201cWe also expect the military to step up intelligence gathering because it beats the imagination that 200 or 300 people will move from one point to another on motorcycles to kidnap school children and disappear into thin air.\u201d\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Federal Ministry of Education said the rescue of the 348 students still held in captivity was the responsibility of security operatives.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that no fewer than 348 students were still being held by bandits.\n\nOut of the 348 students, three categories numbering 227 had been languishing in bandits\u2019 dens many weeks after they were abducted from their schools in Niger, Kebbi and Kaduna states.\n\nOn Monday, the situation worsened when hoodlums stormed the Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State, abducting 121 students.\n\nDifferent organisations such as UNICEF, UNESCO had expressed worry over the increased abductions with pressure groups such as the National Union of Teachers calling for the resuscitation of Safe Schools Initiative Programme to end the spate of abductions in schools especially in Kaduna state.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, who spoke in an interview with The PUNCH said it was the exclusive duty of security agents to rescue the victims.\n\nHe said \u201cSecurity operatives are saddled with the responsibility of rescuing the abducted students. It is in no way the responsibility of the federal ministry of education.\n\n\u201cWe are all sad, worried and we understand that the parents are mourning, however, we can\u2019t do anything about it.\n\n\u201cSecurity operatives are already aware and we can\u2019t say this is what we are doing because we don\u2019t know the plans of the security agents. It is their duty and not ours.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nFormer Nigeria Ambassador to Argentina, Ambassador Empire Kanu, has lambasted the federal government for the alleged abduction and extradition of the Leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe ex-diplomat argued that instead of persecuting Kanu, the Nigeria Authorities should be concerned about addressing the germane issues he is raising.\n\nHe warned Government against hunting Kanu as if he were the problem of Nigeria, saying he has the right to demand a better treatment for his people.\n\nThe first republic House of Representatives member, challenged the federal government to demonstrate genuine efforts towards addressing the grievances of agitators of self-determination in the country and see if the agitations would not cease.\n\nHe wondered why the federal government is so worried about Kanu who is only agitating for equity and justice while doing little to rein in Fulani herdsmen and bandits ravaging the country.\n\n\u201d Why is the federal government so worried about Nnamdi Kanu. What has he done to warrant all this apprehension?\n\n\u201d When you have herdsmen and Miyetti Allah ravaging the country, why is Government not going after them? If you want a fair deal, round up others too.\n\n\u201d This union was forced on us by the British. The military twisted the constitution in favour of the North. Since then things have not been right.\n\n\u201d So Nnamdi and millions of other youths like him are not happy that they are being treated as second class citizens in their own country.\n\n\u201d Easterners have been marginalised and if your rights are being taken away and you continue to endure it but your children come up and say no, that they can\u2019t tolerate it anymore, what do you do?\n\n\u201d The question is: what is Nnamdi asking for? Is it not simple referendum? Why is Government afraid of giving referendum to him and others who believe in the cause he is championing to determine whether or not they want to continue in this union?\n\n\u201d Yugoslavia had referendum and today they have their separate countries living in peace. Germany had referendum. Even Britain that put us into this union also had referendum and opted out of European Union.\n\n\u201d Why is it that Britain allowed Island and Scotland to have referendum but is unwilling to allow Eastern region to have referendum?\n\n\u201d Britain should talk now and leave us alone. If you give us referendum nobody will agitate again because the outcome of the referendum will solve this quarrel.\n\n\u201d So, what is the problem in asking for referendum? Is Government not the one harrasing Nnamdi Kanu? They are the ones harrasing the poor boy.\n\n\u201d He was arrested and granted bail. He was enjoying his bail when soldiers raided his home and he fled. It\u2019s only a tree that they came to cut down and it remained where it was.\n\n\u201d Now that they have abuducted him back to the country they should respect his rights and follow the rule of law. They should allow him access to his family, doctors and lawyers.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Kanu argued that the agitation for self determination is fueled by injustice perpetrated against South Easterners, adding that Kanu only represents millions of others who are yelling for Justice.\n\n\u201d Do they think we are blind? Why is their attention on oil? They are mining gold in the North and who is auditing them? Look at how the Petroleum Industry Bill was messed up? Host communities now to scramble for 3 per cent while 30% is for exploration of oil.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\nBy Chris Onuoha\n\nKehinde Akinyemi-Okomah is a passionate leader, with a long track record of successful business management.\n\nThough coming from a finance background, she has been in the Oil & Gas industry for over 18 years before delving into snacks and juice production as the founder, TemnnysFoods. In this interview, Kehinde talks about the effects of GMO food, eating habits and other things.\n\nSpeaking about eating habits generally, what do you consider harmful in the way people eat?\n\nA vast majority of people give little or no attention to proper eating habits or even study about eating habits and what it entails. Poor eating habits are detrimental to the body.\n\nThe risk of poor nutrition also has its roots in our eating habits. A very common bad eating habit is snacking round the clock on high calorie, unhealthy and junk foods.\n\nThis habit can pose a threat to one\u2019s health in the long run. Snacking on organic, gluten-free, non-GMO foods is highly recommendable and body-friendly.\n\nWhen you say, snacking on organic, gluten-free, non-GMO foods is highly recommendable and body-friendly, what do you mean?\n\nIt\u2019s very important that I explain the term \u2018GMO\u2019; that way you would understand clearly. GMOs, short for genetically modified organisms, are subject to a lot of controversies. In the food industry, GMO crops have had genes added to them for various reasons such as improving their growth, nutritional content, sustainability, pest resistance and ease of farming.\n\nWhile GMO crops make farming much easier, there is some concern around their potential effect on the environment and their safety for human consumption \u2014 specifically surrounding illnesses and allergies.\n\nWe keep our products non-GMO and gluten-free because we ensure the use of natural plants whose genetic components have not been altered.\n\nIn Nigeria, foods such as fufu, garri, yam and others are taken as satisfying meals. Will your non-GMO snacks ever replace major meals in this clime?\n\nWe understand the love that Nigerians have for their conventional meals and we are very much aware that Nigerians have some of the best of meals in the world.\n\nHowever, snacking will never replace the delectable Nigerian heavy meals but rather complement them. We also understand the importance of a balanced diet. Eating healthy shouldn\u2019t be hard and it should not hold you back from doing what you love.\n\nWhat are the challenges of doing business in Nigeria?\n\nNigeria as one of Africa\u2019s major players in commerce and industry is faced with some challenges that may overwhelm the operations of businesses. These challenges include the current security issues plaguing the country, poor electricity supply and lack of adequate infrastructure.\n\nIn what way do you think government can be of assistance to the food manufacturing industry?\n\nNo business can succeed very well without the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring a good environment and business policies for all forms of businesses to thrive.\n\nGovernment and business have a relationship with the action of one imposing a resultant effect on the other.\n\nThe best way the government can be of assistance is to create enabling and sustainable business policies and regulations that would encourage business activities in the country.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has again called on President Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from an imminent collapse.\n\nThe apex christian body in a statement by its General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, yesterday, in Abuja said it was time government rose to the menace of criminals operating with impunity as terrorists, killer herdsmen, bandits and armed robbers.\n\n\u201cThe impression that is being created in the mind of the people is that government knows these criminals but only refused to bring them to book but rather, treats them with kids gloves.\u201d\n\nIt called on the president to direct the military, police and other security agencies to effect the safe release of kidnapped Pastor Popoola David Kayode of Calvary Baptist Church, Kurmin Mashi, Kaduna State. Kayode was kidnapped by unknown gunmen barely 24 hours after the abduction of 140 students of Bethel Baptist High School, Damishin, in Chukun Local Government Area also in Kaduna State.\n\nIn warned that the case of Pastor Kayode should not be like that of Rev. Lawan Andimi, district chairman, Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN) and CAN Chairman of Michika Local Government Area who was abducted and killed by Boko Haram some years ago without any intervention by the government to save him.\n\nCAN called on Nigerians, Christians and non-Christians, to join in a seven days intercessory prayers it has declared to ask to God to stop further attacks on the country by bandits, kidnappers and terrorists.\n\n\u201cTo us in CAN, we believe that the freedom of the pastor is a litmus test for the service chiefs, especially the new Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Yahaya Farouk and Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. The whole world is watching whether they will live up to the expectations or not. If the then U.S President, Donald Trump, could put his acts together from far away America and ordered his military to rescue only one kidnapped American in Nigeria, then, our President has no excuse not to act decisively and rescue this servant of God.\n\n\u201cWhy should the government leave Nigerians to be at the mercy of insurgents, bandits and kidnappers? What is the essence of having a government in place? The government that did everything to ensure that leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, was brought back to the country is strong enough to stop these criminalities if the political will is there.\n\n\u201cMr. President, where shall we go from here? Have the criminals taken over where there is legitimate government? Though, we are praying earnestly continuously, we know faith without hard work from the side of government is vain. While we are aware you are doing your best, but your best is not good enough to Nigerians and in the eyes of the whole world. The bitter truth is that no place is safe again in this country.\u201d\n\nCAN requested that Nigerians pray to God to help the government to be sensitive to the ordeals and yearnings of the people and end bandits\u2019 attacks on schools and colleges where the innocent children are being exposed to psychological trauma, thus creating phobia for the young ones who are eager to acquire education.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye and Fred Eze, Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2 in the country.\n\nThe NCDC Director-General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu confirmed this Thursday evening, urging Nigerians that given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place.\n\nThe Delta variant which has been detected in over 90 countries is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant is expected to spread to more countries.\n\nThe variant has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation. There are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nIhekweazu noted that as part of the country\u2019s COVID-19 response, the agency had been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response activities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis, he said includes the introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern. The national travel protocol which includes compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, are in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.\n\nThe NCDC stressed that it was very important that this was strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.\n\nIhekweazu said: \u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID- 19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, states are urged to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population,\u201d he advised.\n\nThe NCDC boss added that \u201cAlthough we have seen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly important that we do not forget to be careful. The surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face.\n\n\u201cPlease protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures, getting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant continue to be testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel and public restrictions.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe British government has warned the rise in conflicts can destabilise Nigeria\u2019s democracy in the run-up to the 2023 elections.\n\nThis is even as governors on the platform of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum have declared that the level of insecurity across parts of the country is not only eroding citizens safety and peoples means of livelihood, but also threatening the expression of the rights of all Nigerians.\n\nBoth spoke at the launch of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative (PISI) in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nDevelopment director, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), Chris Beecroft, in his good will message blamed the frequent crisis across the country on injustice and impunity, as well as weak justice institutions in the country, noting however, that peace and stability could be achieved when the causes of conflict in society are managed through strong, fair, and responsive governance mechanisms at community, state, or federal level.\n\nHe stressed that the conflict represents an existential threat to Nigeria\u2019s unity and its development.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe rise in conflict risks destabilising Nigeria\u2019s democracy in the run-up to the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThere is an active insurgency in the North East; farmer-herder conflicts are extending across the country; resource conflicts in the Delta; tension in the South-East; and banditry in the North West.\n\n\u201cConflict destroys lives, destroys livelihoods, destroys hope and ambition for the future. Conflict represents an existential threat to Nigeria\u2019s unity and its development.\u201d\n\nBeecroft explained that the use of the police and army would only be part of the solution, and called for greater emphasis \u201con reconciliation, mediation, arbitration, and access to justice \u2013 all vital components of a vibrant, resilient, and effective social contract.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, proliferation of small arms and weapons and the weaponisation of social media, are drivers of conflict and instability.\n\nHe called for job creation for young Nigerians \u201cso they have a stake in a prosperous and peaceful Nigeria,\u201d adding however, that \u201cwith the right commitment, dedications and support, there are solutions.\u201d\n\nBeecroft stated that the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office recognised the important role the NGF plays in setting the peace and security agenda, and in building state and community level structures and institutions to reduce violence and respond to conflict and insecurity across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe UK is pleased to have been able to support this initiative and is committed to continue working with the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) in advancing its peace and security agenda.\n\n\u201cThe UK is engaged in supporting Nigeria to reduce violent conflict in a number of areas. We promote a regional response in the North East and Lake Chad Basin through our contribution to the Regional Stabilisation Facility (RSF) and delivery of programmes on peace building, humanitarian assistance, protection of civilians, human development, good governance and accountability.\n\nFormer head of state and Chairman of National Peace Committee Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd), in his remarks, expressed worry over what he called \u201cthe instrumentalisation of violence,\u201d noting that \u201cviolence has become a commodity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAbubakar, who was represented by Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, said Nigerians are in denial of the diagnosis.\n\nAccording to him, poverty is not the cause of violence in Nigeria, arguing that China has about 300 million unemployed.\n\nChairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), and governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi said Nigeria, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues, noted that the spate of violence and coordinated criminal activities have undermined government authority and waned public trust in recent times.\n\nHe attributed the current security crisis in the country to several factors, \u201cincluding an oversized population that the government is unable to cope with, a large number of poor people estimated at over 40 percent of the population who are living below $1 per day, and indeed, desertification which has affected over 60 percent of Nigeria\u2019s land, as drought and climate change has continued to aggravate land deterioration in the country.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman also blamed the situation on proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which he said worsened and exacerbated the level of violence and fatalities.\n\nHe said, \u201cbetween May 2011 and February 2021, over 76,000 deaths were reported.\n\n\u201cThis number also includes persons who have been killed by a state actor.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the proliferation of arms is an undertone of rising ethnic conflict, with different ethnic groups subsumed in conflicts and pitched against one another.\n\nNGF\u2019s Director General, Asishana Okauru, explained that the launch forges a significant step in the life of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum as \u201cwe strive to build a nation where safety of lives and property is guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative is a consequence of our determination to contribute to the conversation on inclusive security and add the leverage of the sub-nationals to the efforts to secure the lives and property of our country men and women.\n\n\u201cWith the support of the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), we have been able to set up the Peace and Security Desk at the NGF to help in driving the dialogue around keeping the country safe and bringing all State and non-State actors together around one table to frame a sustainable resolution to the series of security challenges confronting our national experiment.\n\n\u201cI can assure you of the commitment of States not only to the objectives of the PIS initiative but to sustainable peace in the country. The presence of some of our principals today is a testament to this commitment and resolve.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Everyone wanted to move as closer as possible to catch a glimpse of the deceased.\n\nThe cleric, who is the founder of SCOAN, died on June 5, after he had ministered in one of the church\u2019s programnes a day earlier.\n\nJune 8 is the lying-in-state as the day four of the activities marking the burial ceremony of the departed prophet.\n\nAs they bid Joshua farewell, the church\u2019s ushers had a hectic day in calming and consoling people whose voices went above the speakers.

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2 in Nigeria.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility A statement issued Thursday night by the Head of Communications at the NCDC, Dr. Yahaya Disu, said the variant was detected in a traveler to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travelers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nAs part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response, NCDC said it has been working with the Nigerian\n\nInstitute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases\n\n(ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic\n\nsequencing.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response\n\nactivities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global\n\nmechanism for sharing sequencing data.\n\n\u201cGiven the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly,\u201d it said.\n\nNCDC said that given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria,\n\nall Nigerians should ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures\n\nin place.\n\nIt added, \u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent\n\nhandwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-\n\n19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the Centre urged states to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public, adding that public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nAccording to the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, \u201cAlthough we have\n\nseen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly\n\nimportant that we do not forget to be careful.\n\nThe surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures,\n\ngetting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nThe Centre said that the recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant \u201cis to continue to\n\nbe testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel\n\nand public restrictions\u201d.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of\n\nconcern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90\n\ncountries and is expected to spread to more countries. The variant has also been linked\n\nto a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nThere are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and\n\ntherapeutics.\n\nNCDC further said that government had through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC)\n\ninitiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the agency this includes introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern..\n\nIt also said that the national travel protocols including compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, were in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus.

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, Thursday said the service had appointed some commercial banks as agents to recover the sum of N1.82 trillion from accounts of Messrs Multi-Choice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and Multi-Choice Africa (MCA).\n\nHe said the decision to appoint the banks as agents and to freeze the affected accounts was as a result of the group\u2019s continued refusal to grant FIRS access to its servers for audit.\n\nAccording to him, it was discovered that the companies persistently breached all agreements and undertakings with the service and would not promptly respond to correspondences.\n\nNami, in a statement by Director, Communications and Liaison Department, FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, said Multi-choice, the owners of DSTV, \u201clacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records\u201d.\n\nNami stressed that it was important that Nigeria puts a stop to all tax frauds which had been going on for too long.\n\nHe said all companies must be held accountable and made to pay their fair share of relevant taxes including back duty taxes owed, especially VAT for which they were ordinarily agents of collection.\n\nSpecifically, he said MultiChoice Nigeria had avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nHe also accused the companies of being involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company.\n\nThe statement also pointed out that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in its tax obligations and compliance level in Nigeria.\n\nNami said:\u201dThe level of non-compliance by Multi-Choice Africa (MCA), the parent Company of Multi-Choice Nigeria (MCN) is very alarming. The parent company, which provides services to MCN has never paid Value Added Tax (VAT) since its inception.\n\n\u201cThe issue with tax collection in Nigeria, especially from foreign-based companies conducting businesses in Nigeria and making massive profits is frustrating and infuriating to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cRegrettably, companies come into Nigeria just to infringe on our tax laws by indulging in tax evasion. There is no doubt that broadcasting, telecommunications and the cable-satellite industries have changed the face of communication in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said:\u201dHowever, when it comes to tax compliance, some companies are found wanting. They do with impunity in Nigeria what they dare not try in their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FIRS, Nigeria contributes 34 per cent of total revenue for the Multi-Choice group followed by Kenya with 11 per cent and Zambia with 10 per cent.\n\nThe rest of Africa where they have presence accounts for 45 per cent of the group\u2019s total revenue, he added.\n\nNami said information currently at the disposal of the service revealed a tax liability of N1.822 trillion for relevant years of assessment including $342.53 million.\n\nHe explained that \u201cUnder the FIRS powers in Section 49 of the Companies Income Tax Act Cap C21 LFN 2004 as amended, Section 41 of the Value Added Tax Act Cap V1 LFN 2004 as amended and Section 31 of the FIRS (Establishment) Act No. 13 of 2007, all bankers to MCA and MCN in Nigeria were therefore appointed as Collecting Agents for the full recovery of the aforesaid tax debt.\u201d\n\nHe added:\u201dIn this regard, the affected banks are required to sweep balances in each of the above-mentioned entities\u2019 accounts and pay the same in full or part settlement of the companies\u2019 respective tax debts until full recovery.\n\n\u201cThis should be done before the execution of any transaction involving the companies or any of their subsidiaries.

          "text": "By Olawale Ajimotokan\n\nThe Federal Government has asked Germany to ensure a full and unconditional return of\n\nthe 1,130 Benin artefacts that were looted from the country in the 19th century and domiciled in German museums.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the demand on Wednesday during meetings in Berlin with German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Monika Grutters, and Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas.\n\nHe insisted the return should be whole rather than substantial on the heel of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u2018substantial return\u2019 of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nHe also said the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the art works.\n\n\u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin)\u201d, Mohammed said.\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, Mohammed also reiterated that no conditions should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the Benin Bronzes in addition to concluding all necessary negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe said the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the art works was not the end of an era but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy, between both countries.\n\nHe thanked Germany for taking the lead in the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts that were looted from Nigeria and the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead,\u201d he said\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation, said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum was being built in Benin city to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nHe said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the federal government of Nigeria, the (Benin) royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nOn his part, the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar, said the issue of the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes should be seen as an opportunity to take the cooperation between Nigeria and Germany to a greater height.\n\nHe also commended the government of Germany for taking the lead in the repatriation process.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, said \u201cthe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from the beginning of 2022.\n\nShe noted that the fact that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, saying all the Museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani and Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace turned museum in the heart of Berlin that houses art works from around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

So, Tinubu jetted off to God knows where (someone said London) to escape public humiliation.\u201d",
          "summary": "SaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us.\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses.\nWard con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.",

No 3000/FCT/X/D9/ VoL 62/38, dated July 8, 2021.\n\nThey accused him of inciting public disturbance.\n\nThe letter read, \"This office is investigating a case of inciting public disturbance wherein your name featured prominently. In view of the above, you are kindly requested to interview the undersigned through the officer in charge of Gender Section, Criminal Investigation Department, Abuja today 8/7/2021.\n\nSaharaReporters also learnt that the report of an autopsy conducted at the instance of the police confirmed that Karen was raped and sodomised.\n\nHe died from a sepsis infection caused by the condom which was left in her uterus by yet-to-be-identified persons in the school.\n\nThe police last week commenced an investigation into the matter to unravel the cause of the death of the pupil.\n\nSurprisingly, the police, through Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Fom Pam Joseph refused to release the copy of the medical report to the police-appointed pathologist, which eventually stalled the scheduled autopsy.\n\nThe principal pathologist at the Maitama General Hospital, Dr. Desmond Ike Okonkwo was appointed by the police to conduct the autopsy. He had demanded from the police a copy of the medical report on the death of Keren-Happuch.\n\nThe pathologist said having a copy of the medical report was a pre-condition for him to conduct the autopsy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Responders who have been following the matter compelled the DCP to release the documents after being pressured by his superior.\n\nThe group in a statement issued in Abuja accused the police of handling the matter with levity and lack of professionalism, noting that the attitude of DCP Fom Pam Joseph\n\nwas an indication that the police had no regard for cases of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nThe school authority in an attempt to conceal the truth claimed that no such incident occurred in the school premises adding that Keren was diagnosed with having diabetes when she was 9 years old but was mismanaged by her doctor and parents.\n\nThe group has vowed to continue with the rally and not to be cowed or intimidated by police invitation in demanding justice for the SS1 student whose life was cut short.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director, Make a Difference Initiative, and a member of the group, Lemmy Ughegbe, the group will stop at nothing in ensuring that those who perpetrated the act are brought to justice.\n\nHe said, \"The cry for justice for the late schoolgirl, Karen, is on, and we will continue to stay on the story until the right thing is done until justice is done. Coalition of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Responders is committed to this and we are continually seeking safe spaces for our children.\n\n\"Remember one out of ten boys before their 18th birthday get violated and one out of three girls get violated before their 18th birthday. So this is serious and we must seek justice for Karen-Happuch Akpagher.\"",

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "text": "Our people have a saying, when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. This is indisputable. Six tons of hard muscle and bones will do a cruel number on any lawn, no matter how stubborn the grass is\u2014it just has to bow down to the ancestors.\n\nBut what happens when the elephants in question are not two, but three of the biggest Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) platforms in Africa!\n\nWhat\u2019s the big news?\n\nWell, the grass just got greener on the Netflix side of town.\n\nNextflix just announced a mobile-only subscription starting at $3.99\u2014 that\u2019s more than half the price of its basic subscription plan.\n\nSomebody play Dorime.\n\nThe new plan caters for the majority of its African audience who stream Netflix from their mobile. And is currently available to users in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and other SubSaharan countries.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.\n\nNetflix also launched a Play Partial Download feature that allows users to play Netflix videos which haven\u2019t downloaded completely.\n\nThis means that if your connection cuts off while you\u2019re downloading an episode of Blood and Water, you can still watch the fraction that actually entered your device, and resume your download when you get a stronger connection.\n\nAre you excited? Because we are!\n\nBut this news isn\u2019t exactly unexpected, given the fact that Netflix\u2019s been in a streaming battle with two other African SVOD elephants, iRokoTV and Showmax.\n\nIn fact, with each party trying to outdo the other with more customer-friendly updates, it was actually pretty predictable, and we\u2019ll show you why.\n\nNetflix\u2019s streaming tussle in Africa\n\nWhen Netflix arrived in Africa in 2016, everyone anticipated a struggle with reigning SVOD champion, iRokoTV, even though Netflix offered mostly foreign movies and while iRokoTV focused on Nollywood.\n\nAs expected Netflix proved its mettle by edging into the African movies market too with blockbuster movies like October 1, Lion Heart, The boy who harnessed the wind, Azali, amongst others.\n\nWith Netflix pushing on one end, and a decline in the spending income of its primary market, Nigerians, iRokoTV faced its abroad audience\u2014who can blame them, really?\n\nAnd just when Netflix thought it was its turn to hog the spotlight, boom!\n\nAnother bull elephant in the ring\n\nIts name? Showmax.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

They set up the company to eliminate fragmented distribution networks and stores they observed in small retail establishments.\n\nThe company employs fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution networks to distribute digital financial services and FMCG goods because many Kenyans go to these stores for their financial need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, the stores serve as points of distribution for financial services.\n\nThese stores also help customers access various forms of financial services such as payments, savings, remittances, and insurance.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the retail startup got into Y Combinator because they utilise FMCG distribution networks.

The founders believe that RejaReja represents most of the company\u2019s best opportunities.\n\nIn June 2021, Digiduka, a retail platform founded in Kenya, was acquired by MarketForce.\n\nDigiduka makes it easy for retailers of digital services such as airtime, electricity tokens, and bill payments to resell their products on the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketForce\u2019s acquisition of Digiduka allowed it to fully integrate with RejaReja, which provides a mobile wallet for retailers to act as agents for payments and collection via a mobile app, WhatsApp bots, and USSD shortcodes.\n\nMarketForce intends to launch RejaReja in Nigeria and then expand its product to more East African towns throughout.\n\nRejaReja is currently operating in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, where it claims to process thousands of orders daily on behalf of over 15,000 retail customers.\n\nAs computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech, Mbaabu and Sibuti found it difficult to scale the company initially; however, the company claims to have experienced team members.\n\nAlthough retail distribution is a core business, the CEO stated that finding the right talent and individuals willing to innovate and revolutionise the space has been an interesting challenge.",

Source: Maxime Bayen\n\nWith the coronavirus pandemic expected to affect investment activities, in May 2020, AfricArena, an African tech accelerator, projected that startups on the continent would receive between $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion in venture funding in 2020. Partech Africa and Briter Bridges reported that African startups ended the year with $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n\nExpectedly, things picked up this year as more people were vaccinated.\n\nData from Digest Africa, an investment news platform, seems to support Bayen\u2019s conclusions.

Things picked up again in May, with investments going from $78 million in April to $208.5 million in May.\n\nAccording to Digest Africa, the largest investments went to Expensya ($20 million), Gro Intelligence ($85 million), TymeBank ($109 million), and Flutterwave ($170 million). Comparing the amounts raised by African startups since 2019, it took nearly 11 months for funding in Africa to hit the billion-dollar mark in 2019, 9 months in 2020, and 5 months in 2021.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing lockdown contributed to a slump in investment activities as investors\u2019 interests dwindled due to uncertainties.

The service means applicants can upload a suitable digital photo from their smartphone or tablet, making applying for a passport quick and simple. In total, the whole process takes 10 minutes.\n\nAregbesola is introducing a host of new tech projects under issuance of passport, and he hopes to complete and implement most of these very soon. The most crucial one, already in its pilot stages, is the integration.\n\nIntegration with the database that can make verification a much less tedious task for the passport authorities, This integration will help Nigerians with establishing identity by verifying even the biometric match.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has disclosed that:\n\n\u201cWe have created special centres for expedited services. These special centres will run on public-private partnership basis. This has already taken off in Abuja and 10 more will be opened in coming weeks as more of such centres will be opened all over the country. Our goal is to have one in each local government, university campuses, institutions of higher learning and other places.\n\nA timeline will be fixed for every application i.e., a collection date. This will be six weeks, comparable to what obtains in other countries. This is to allow for enough time to investigate and validate personal information supplied by the applicants. What we are driving at is the peace of mind that comes from assurance of certainty. If there are circumstances that will make the date to change, it will be communicated to the applicant one week before the collection date.\n\nApplicants will have no basis for further communication with officers, other than to complete their application process and leave the venue. The date for the collection of their passports or any challenge to the application, will be communicated to them. The technology for the efficient running of this system has been acquired and will be deployed.\n\nWe are publishing on our website the list of the backlog of passports that are ready which are yet to be collected by the owners. They will be required to go to the state commands to collect them.\u201d\n\nTo permanently curb the complaints of difficulty in obtaining Passports from the NIS, Aregbesola has came up with several innovations that all pending passports will be Issued on or before May 31st, 2021 and starting from June 1, 2021, a new regime will begin. It has become imperative that we review our operations and rejig our system, in order to be able to offer excellent services to our clients. We need to review a system from time to time to see if it helps best to serve and realise the objectives. One, Aregbesola has declared a zero-tolerance stance to all forms of touting. No applicant will be made to pay any illegitimate fees. We are going to embed security operatives \u2013 seen and unseen \u2013 in all our passport offices. They will wear body cameras.\n\nThe Federal Government has said that at least 45,000 Passport Booklets are yet to be collected by applicants at the various Nigeria Immigration Service enrolment centres worldwide. This is coming as the government extends the deadline for clearing Passport Backlog initially for 31st May by one week. The new date for the beginning of the new Passport Regime is now June 8. At a review meeting with the management of the Service, it was revealed that 230,000 Passport Booklets have been produced so far and members of the public enjoined to visit their enrolment centres for collection.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola had at a meeting with Passport Control Officers and Attaches of the Service from across the world on April 22 rejigged the Passport Application Processing by announcing sweeping reforms. However, before the beginning of the new passport processing regime, a promise was made to Nigerians to clear all passport backlog.\n\nMinister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola, has said through a public-private partnership, government would establish at least one special centre in each local government area, beginning with Abuja, to speed up passport processing.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Abuja\n\n...",

          "text": "Two Haitian Americans, James Solage and Joseph Vincent were among the six suspects arrested by Haitian police in connection with the assassination on Wednesday of President Jovenel Moise.\n\nFour other suspects were killed in a standoff between the police and the suspects.\n\nAnd latest reports said as many as 28 suspects have been identified, with eight declared wanted.\n\nPolice chief Leon Charles said on Thursday, the country is also looking for the masterminds behind the killing that stunned the impoverished Caribbean nation.\n\nMoise, 53, was shot dead early on Wednesday at his home by what officials said was a commando of apparently foreign, trained killers, pitching the poorest country in the Americas deeper into turmoil amidst political divisions, hunger, and widespread gang violence.\n\nLeon Charles said in a televised briefing on Thursday that authorities had tracked down the suspected assassins to a house near the scene of the crime in Petionville, a northern, hillside suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince.\n\nA fierce firefight lasted late into the night on Wednesday and six suspects were taken in custody, while four corpses were retrieved, authorities said.\n\nOfficers were heavily patrolling the area from early on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have the physical authors, now we are looking for the intellectual authors,\u201d Charles said.\n\nHaiti\u2019s minister of elections and interparty relations, Mathias Pierre identified one of the arrested Haiti Americans as James Solages.\n\nHe did not identify the second American. But Miami Herald identified him as Joseph Vincent. He is about 56 years old.\n\nCharles said the local population had helped police track down the suspects but he implored residents in the sprawling seafront city of one million people not to take justice into their own hands.\n\nWho is James Solage?\n\nMeanwhile the American media have been profiling James Solage, arrested in connection with Jovenel\u2019s assassination.\n\nSolage in a profile published by heavy.com, was a former chief commander of guards for Haiti\u2019s Canadian embassy.\n\nHe is self-employed and had Skills in \u2018Military Police\u2019 & Was Living in Fort Lauderdale.

He was the chief commander of body-guards for The Canadian embassy in Haiti. Currently, Mr. Solages works as a corporate executive serving as a consultant in different locations throughout South Florida.

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced Thursday night that it has detected a confirmed case of the Delta variant of COVID-19, also known as lineage B.1.617.2.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said the variant was detected in a traveler to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nThe agency has urged Nigerians to step up the COVID-19 safety protocols. It also urged state governments to ensure sample collection and testing for the virus is accessible to all.\n\n\u201cGiven the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, NCDC urges all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place.\n\n\u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, states are urged to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population\u201d.\n\nRead the rest of the statement:\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility.\n\nThe variant has been detected in over 90 countries and is expected to spread to more countries. The variant has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nThere are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nAs part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response, NCDC has been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing. This is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response activities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travellers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly.\n\nThe Government of Nigeria through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. This includes the introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern. The national travel protocol which includes compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, are in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus. It is very important that this is strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.\n\nGiven the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, NCDC urges all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. Proven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease.\n\nAdditionally, states are urged to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nAccording to the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, \u201cAlthough we have seen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly important that we do not forget to be careful. The surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures, getting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nThe recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant continue to be testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel and public restrictions.",

It is purely a dangerous signal to our democracy,\n\n\u201cWhy on earth will the presidency hail the crude attack by the DSS? It is an infringement on his rights as a person. It is also an indication that the nation is drifting towards a tailspin.\n\n\u201cAs a group that is determined to secure the South-West region, we will not fold our arms and allow the criminal Fulani herdsmen to overrun our communities. We also will not relent in our efforts in ensuring a safe region,\u201d Ireti said.\n\nThe SSSG appealed to prominent Yoruba leaders, including traditional rulers, not to leave Igboho alone to suffer injustice against the Yoruba race.",

He moved the motion in terms of the motion paper.\n\nBut the Prosecution\u2019s lawyer, Shogunle, opposed the bail application, arguing that while Ojerinde was in their custody, they granted him administrative bail, but that he breached it.\n\nShogunle supported his argument citing paragraph 5 (e, f, g) of his counter-affidavit.\n\nHe also feared that if released, (The Defendant) could influence the witnesses and the ongoing investigations.\n\nHe argued further that the claim of ill-health which Ojerinde was relying on as a ground for the bail application was not supported by a medical report.\n\nIn his objection, Ojerinde\u2019s lawyer said they have filed their reply to the prosecution\u2019s counter-affidavit, saying if they had not concluded their investigations they would not charge Ojerinde to court.\n\nIn his ruling, the presiding Judge, Justice Obiora Egwuatu who granted him bails in the sum of N200 million with two sureties in like sum gave terms to the bail application.\n\nAccording to the bail terms, one surety must be a professor in a Federal University and the other must be a property owner in Abuja.\n\nNot only that, the court also held that their residences must be verified.\n\nThe court equally ordered that the defendant in the matter must deposit his passport with the court registrar.\n\nThe matter has since been adjourned till July 22 and 23 for trial.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

This Party finds the action absolutely unacceptable, totally condemns it and unequivocally urges those responsible for the ill-advised suspension to rescind the decision and recall the lawmakers without any delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImo PDP recognizes that the suspended lawmakers are elected representatives of Imo people. The Party notes that to a very large extent the lawmakers are answerable to the people, whose mandates they are exercising, and should seamlessly be exercising. We are quite aware that the rules and regulations of the House does not envision the witch-hunt of the lawmakers by their equals that are privileged to be organizing the running and working of the House as is the case in the 9th Assembly.\n\nOur Party considers as not cogent enough the reasons floated by the leadership of the House for the act of suspension of elected lawmakers. They are simply too vindictive, high-handed, dehumanizing and provocative The legislature is an arm of Government and not a department of the executive arm of Government. The system in Imo State where the executive arm arrogates so much power and authority over the legislature is undemocratic and must be jettisoned, to allow democracy to blossom and flourish in the State.\n\nWhile our Party studies further the circumstances that led to the show of shame in the Imo Assembly, we keenly observe how the powers that be in the House are going to handle and manage the latest slap on democracy. We would, therefore warn that the executive arm of Government should desist from its meddlesomeness in the affairs of the legislative arm. That warning is coming because of our privileged information that the leadership of the House is composed by rubber stamp stooges of the executive in the State.\n\nImo PDP frowns at the prevarications of Governor Hope Uzodinma, who pontificates on the need for peaceful atmosphere in the State, but directly and indirectly continually sponsors acts that are capable of breaching the peace of the State and the people. Governor Uzodinma should leave Imo State House of Assembly alone to make useful laws for Imo people. Witch-hunting and hounding elected lawmakers, particularly those of the opposition PDP, is not in tandem with the governor\u2019s much talk about restoring peace in the State. Let there be genuine efforts to keep Imo State peaceful.\n\nSigned:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgubundu Nwadike,\n\nState Publicity Secretary,\n\nImo PDP.",

          "text": "Health authorities in Nigeria have detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2.\n\nThey urged citizens to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures given the deadly nature of the variant.\n\n\u201cThe variant was detected in a traveller to the country, following the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing\u201d, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said in a statement Thursday. The tests were conducted at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility. It has been detected in over ninety countries and is expected to spread to more countries.\n\nThe variant has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response, NCDC has been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing,\u201d Yahya Disu, NCDC\u2019s head of communications said in the statement.\n\nHe said the move is \u201cto enable the detection of variants of concern and initiate response activities\u201d.\n\nMr Disu added further that \u201call data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travellers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly\n\n\u201cThe Government of Nigeria through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. This includes the introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern.\u201d The NCDC urged citizens to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures given the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant.\n\n\u201cGiven the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, NCDC urges all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place,\u201d the agency said.\n\n\u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement quoted the Director-General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu as saying, \u201calthough we have seen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly important that we do not forget to be careful.\n\n\u201cThe surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures, getting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

It is however not clear if she has deregistered herself before the appointment or screening.\n\nShe has been a vocal and ardent supporter of Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari, the APC and a strong critic of the PDP and other opponents of the country\u2019s leader.\n\nShe\u2019s the presidential aide on new media and is being screened as an INEC commissioner.\n\nThe Nigerian leader nominated her for the role in October 2020 but the senate only began working on his request for her confirmation in June. Her nomination has widely been condemned by people on the grounds that she is partisan.\n\nLast week, the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) staged a peaceful protest to the National Assembly to demand the rejection of Onochie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no partisanship in my blood. I have seen many petitions against my nomination not only from the PDP but also from some APC members,\u201d she told members of the panel during the screening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not partisan. They know. It is about the law. No one has any reason to fear for my nomination as INEC commissioner representing Delta. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m madam due process. That\u2019s why all the attacks. I follow due process, I follow the law.\u201d\n\nDissatisfied lawmakers on the panel however demanded Onochie reject the nomination and \u201cprotect the integrity of the president\u201d.\n\nIstifanus Gyang, senator representing Plateau North, presented an affidavit in which Onochie had said she is an APC member.\n\nResponding to the claims, she said \u201csince Buhari was elected as president for the second term, I have removed myself from everything about politics.\n\n\u201cSince 2019, I don\u2019t have anything to do with politics.
