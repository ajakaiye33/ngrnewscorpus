          "title": "We felt overwhelmed, tempted to kill our babies \u2013Women who suffered postpartum depression",
          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nIn commemoration of the 2021 World Mental Health Day celebrated annually on October 10, we focus on the experiences of survivors and persons battling mental health conditions. LARA ADEJORO in this report writes on the experiences of women who suffered postpartum depression\n\nAfter surviving nine months of disrupted sleep and tiring days, Mrs. Aronke Feyi-Emmanuel thought taking care of her baby after delivery and managing the home front was going to be easy.\n\nFor the first few days, everything went as expected. Her daughter was a healthy bundle of joy who took to nursing right away, slept soundly, and hardly ever cried.\n\nBut gradually, Mrs. Feyi-Emmanuel started to feel sad, overwhelmed, and consistently tearful. She frequently felt irritable and on edge.\n\nEverything changed\n\nShe had limited support\u2014her parents were in another country and the family she was staying with had to go to work.\n\n\u201cI began to feel overwhelmed at first. I had thoughts of throwing the baby against the wall or even dropping her on the floor.\n\n\u201cOf course, those were not normal thoughts. I loved my baby and the idea of being celebrated for having the baby but the responsibilities of care for the baby at that time overwhelmed me and opened the gateway to those thoughts,\u201d she said.\n\nShe felt utterly incapable of soothing her baby and would get frustrated and tearful, especially when she\u2019s alone with the baby.\n\nOpening up to PUNCH HealthWise, Mrs. Feyi-Emmanuel said not getting enough rest and having to do a lot of chores triggered her depression.\n\nAccording to experts, first-time mothers have a higher risk than other new mums for developing postpartum depression.\n\nA psychiatrist, Dr. Obi Igbokwe says postnatal depression is a type of depression that can affect either the mother or father after having a baby.\n\n\u201cThe symptoms include constant sadness, lack of energy, and difficulty bonding with the baby.\n\n\u201cThere is no single known cause for postpartum depression but there are several risk factors that predispose one to develop the condition, such as hormonal changes,a history of mental health problems, and poor social support network.\n\n\u201cOther risk factors include a strenuous relationship with a partner, recent stressful life events, such as bereavement, physical or psychological trauma, such as domestic violence, and having the baby blues,\u201d Igbokwe said.\n\nThe psychiatrist, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of WellNewMe, explained that baby blues is the emotional upheaval that commonly follows the birth of a child and is caused by the sudden change in hormones after delivery, combined with stress, isolation, sleep deprivation, and fatigue.\n\n\u201cIt usually lasts no longer than two weeks, unlike postpartum depression that lasts longer, often more severe, and can sometimes get progressively worse with time,\u201d he added.\n\nA rollercoaster experience\n\nThe Medical Director and Psychiatrist-in-Chief, Pinnacle Medical Services, Lagos, Dr. Maymunah Kadiri, said having a baby is stressful, no matter how much one looks forward to it or how much one loves the child.\n\n\u201cConsidering the sleep deprivation, new responsibilities, and lack of time for oneself, it\u2019s no surprise that a lot of new mums feel like they\u2019re on an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nThe normal part of the challenging transition into motherhood is called baby blues; it affects half of the newborn mothers and starts three to four days after childbirth, and generally subsides by the time the child clocks 10 days.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression, on the other hand, may share many symptoms with baby blues, but its symptoms are more severe and last longer than two weeks and can interfere with a mother\u2019s ability to function and care for her baby. It affects about one in 10 mothers. Therefore, postpartum depression is different from baby blues, \u201d Kadiri said.\n\nSpeaking further, Feyi-Emmanuel said \u201cI was thankful when my husband became available to help but it was only for three weeks, as he needed to return to work and end his vacation.\n\n\u201cI would sometimes stay up late in the night just crying. Those thoughts crept in mostly when I was alone with the baby. I blamed myself for having the baby when I was not quite mentally or emotionally ready. I felt ill-prepared for motherhood, and depression set in. I lost my zeal for work and had to quit my job four months after my baby arrived,\u201d she said.\n\nHer experience with depression lasted for 12 months and overcoming it was not quite instant.\n\nNow, a mother of two children, she is thankful that she was able to overcome her episodes of extreme mood swings that vary from depressive lows to manic highs.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is God loves me because the depression lasted one year after I had my baby.\n\n\u201cI made sure to constantly talk about how I was feeling either to my husband, mum, or friends. I just always talked. I got help too; not being alone with the baby helped. I got a live-in helper.\n\n\u201cI prayed about it. I told God what I felt and what I wanted. I specifically told him I wanted a break of five years from having more children, which He granted.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of research too about postpartum depression and the resources I found online, as well as following some psychiatrists, helped me get out of it. This also helped me when I was ready for my second child to have an entirely different and better experience,\u201d she narrated.\n\nShe urged mothers, especially first-time mothers, to take care of their mental health.\n\n\u201cAs a mum, taking care of your mental health is your primary responsibility.Look out for yourself, spot the signs early and seek help.\u201d\n\nPrevalence rate\n\nIgbokwe noted that it is estimated that the prevalence rate of postpartum depression in Nigeria is around 14 percent in women that have just given birth, which is in line with the 13 percent rate seen globally.\n\nKadiri, who is also a psychotherapist, said studies showed that first-time mothers have a higher risk for postpartum depression than other mums, and their risk is greatest during their first three months of parenthood.\n\nShe said having postpartum depression after the first child raises the likelihood of having postpartum depression after subsequent pregnancies.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression is also more common in certain groups, such as first-time mothers, mothers of preterm babies, women with a prior history of depression, and those who lack a strong support network.\n\n\u201cThe reported rate of clinical postpartum depression among new mothers is between 10 percent to 20 per cent. One recent study found that one in seven women may experience PPD in the year after giving birth,\u201d she said.\n\nTormenting moments\n\nJust like Mrs. Feyi-Emmanuel, Adetoun Afolabi had imagined how happy she would be when she finally had her baby. She could not wait to see him, hold him and give him kisses.\n\nA week after her bundle of joy arrived, however, she felt that it was a constant race against the clock \u2013 with nursing, breastfeeding, and changing.\n\n\u201cI think what triggered it was the sleepless nights and stress from taking care of my baby. It got worse when I was alone with my baby without help and no one to talk to.\n\n\u201cI had unexplainable sadness, loneliness, stress, and fears. I had negative thoughts running through my mind like I couldn\u2019t take care of my baby. What if I made mistakes? What if I was not a good mum?\n\n\u201cI was just crying for no reason. I felt my baby was too demanding, so I hated him,\u201d she said.\n\nThe depression got worse, the symptoms tormented her each day she wakes up and it continued for three months when she finally sought medical help.\n\nBetter days\n\n\u201cAt first, I thought it was just stress, until when I had to talk to a doctor who suggested I move to where people can help and people I can talk to, and those I can trust my baby with.\n\n\u201cHe also advised that I should have alone time and rest. So, I had to move to my parents\u2019 house, where I had people to help me with lots of things, even taking care of me. Then people to talk to, and I could go out alone to do some things on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, gradually, that terrible, hovering feeling of sadness and anxiousness started to lift. It was as if the sun had finally come through the dark clouds that surrounded her.\n\nReflecting on her experience, she said she didn\u2019t believe she was going to have an experience with depression after delivery.\n\nNow, Mrs. Afolabi says she\u2019s doing well and enjoying watching her son grow up. She has come through the experience with an understanding that she can cope with any change life throws into the mix for her.\n\nShe advised: \u201cPostpartum depression is real get help when you need it, be around people, talk to people.\n\n\u201cMake out take time for yourself. Bottle-feeding or exclusive doesn\u2019t determine whether you are a good mum or not. Babies will cry. They are meant to cry; that\u2019s their major means of communication. So don\u2019t get hard on yourself,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Igbokwe also advised mothers to seek help from medical professionals who will be best placed to determine the severity of the condition and what adequate treatment will be needed.\n\nKadiri added that it is important for mothers to recognise the signs and symptoms of postpartum depression so that they can access help as early as possible.\n\n\u201cThe severity of it depends on the number of symptoms, the intensity, and the extent to which they affect mother\u2019s day-to-day life,\u201d she noted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Evans Akere: Innovating African Traditional Wear",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nSince launching his fashion line, Creative Director and CEO of Vanskere, Evans Akere, has become one of the major brands saddled with the responsibility of making African traditional wear acceptable worldwide.\n\nA lawyer by training, his passion and love for fashion, has made his home-grown brand a premium lifestyle brand for men. Renowned for its obsession with craftsmanship, the basic goal Evans says has always been to make stylish and comfortable clothes, a major factor for the brand\u2019s success so far.\n\nWith a clientele list that boasts of politicians, corporate executives and A-list celebrities, Vanskere continues to bridge the market gap for classic, yet, in-trend occasion wear garments tailored for today\u2019s man. Here, he talks about switching from law to the needle profession, the birth of his latest Afro-Athleisure collection- Signore Fusion by Vanskere, (a collection inspired by the COVID19 lockdown) that is now a brand on its own, challenges in the industry and the Nigeria of his dreams.\n\nYou read law in the university, at what point did you embrace fashion?\n\nThat was when I was studying law. I found out that something was not right. I found it difficult to fit in as a law student because I was too elaborate in my dressing. Back then, as a law student, you had to dress corporate in black and white but I like to express myself in my dressing. I like colours.\n\nI remember when I was in law school during my compulsory court attachments, I was actually walked out of court by a Senior Advocate because of the way I was dressed. I wore a purple shirt and a purple tie to court. The judge wanted to take it up that I will not graduate from Law School. I never practiced law or went to court.\n\nI finally made up my mind to do fashion after my call to the Bar. I did not practice.\n\nHow did the VANSKERE brand come to be and how has the brand evolved over the years?\n\nThe VANSKERE brand came to be as a result of my love for fashion. Although I was trained as a lawyer, my passion for fashion supersedes that of law, which made me abandon law. VANSKERE is an abbreviation of my first and last name. It was my nickname from my teenage days. So when it was time for me to set up, it was only logical that I registered the name as the brand name.\n\nThe brand has evolved over the years from a basic fashion brand, to a Luxury fashion brand, with emphasis on modern African traditional wear.\n\nWhat have been your weirdest sources of inspiration for your brand and design direction?\n\nLike I have always said, inspiration is divine, it\u2019s indescribable, and it comes naturally. For an artist, anything can be a source of inspiration. For me, my weirdest source of inspiration has been from lines, curves, and angles.\n\nThe Vanskere brand is fun, but there is also a classic appeal to your apparel. How do you strike an appropriate balance between classic and contemporary?\n\nIt has been easy striking a balance between classic and contemporary fashion because we understand the brand, its core value, and target market. We know it\u2019s imperative that we maintain and sustain our conservative nature, while also meeting the needs of our fashionable customers.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge as a fashion entrepreneur?\n\nMy biggest challenge from day one has always been how to manage my tailors. In Nigeria, there is a lack of efficient tailors, the few available ones are either not loyal or are badly behaved.\n\nHow have you managed this problem over the years?\n\nManaging tailors is a big challenge like I said, the majority of them are not loyal. If you are lucky, you might have one or two who are, but majority of them are not. It\u2019s more challenging when you have a big factory with many of them; you\u2019ll need to be strong mentally and physically to survive each day. Even when you have a factory manager, majority of the issues still end up on your table.\n\nTo stay above board, I see it as a business hazard that I have to endure daily. So, I\u2019m prepared and ready to face them when I come to work each day.\n\nYou have worked in the fashion industry for quite some years now, what is the best lesson you have learned along the way?\n\nMy best lesson so far would be never to design clothes that suit only my personal style.\n\nHow would you describe the fashion industry in Nigeria today? What would you say are the challenges and way forward?\n\nThe industry has definitely grown over the years, more Nigerians are beginning to appreciate locally made clothes and this has increased the level of patronage. The majority of Nigerian designers have stepped up their game, creating beautiful designs with impeccable finishing. But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

          "title": "Abike Dabiri-Erewa: On Nigeria @ 61",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAs Nigeria gets set to celebrate her 61st independence anniversary on Thursday, 1st October, Nigeria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Diaspora Comission (NIDCOM), Hon Abike Dabiri Erewa in this exclusive interview, speaks on some salient issues currently plaguing the country.\n\nThe former House of Representatives Member, who was one of the most vocal voices, especially on the issues of women and children, also opens up on the place of women in politics today, her role and challenges as head of NIDCOM, the issue of migration and of course, the Nigeria of her dreams.\n\nNigeria will on October 1, turn 61 as a nation. At a time like this, do you think there is anything or reason to celebrate?\n\nOf course, there is every reason to celebrate; that we are alive today, that we have a country, and I tell you, it is a country to be proud of. There are challenges no doubt, but we must look at our strengths, rather than our weaknesses. We should look at what unites us rather than what separates us. So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there. But it\u2019s not about government alone, it is about every one of us, at home and in the diaspora, working together to build this great country of ours.\n\nMany Nigerians who trusted your party the APC to bring about change and move them to the next level have had their hopes dashed, with many opting to migrate to other countries. How can hope be rekindled again?\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate. You can\u2019t stop migration, legal or illegal. But, try to avoid irregular migration. And also, when you are in another man\u2019s country, it is important that you try to obey the laws of that country. In the UAE for instance, we are bombarded every day with complaints that UAE is not renewing work permits. But we went to see the UAE Ambassador, and he made it clear that there is no official policy from the UAE government about not renewing work permits. But Nigerians are still being denied work permits. In this situation for instance, it\u2019s a case of the bad now affecting the good.\n\nWhen you are in another man\u2019s country and you go to rob a bank in broad daylight in a place like UAE, I condemned it and I listed the names of the four Nigerians who committed the crime. I was criticized for mentioning their names. People felt it was because they were from a particular section of the country, but when you are out there, you are seen as Nigerian first before any tribe.\n\nThis is a country with laws and zero tolerance for crime. Now those guys are serving life imprisonment. In the same UAE, our brothers took cultism there, and they were killing themselves openly. We have seen a lot of things happen and now the bad is affecting the good.\n\nSo what I am telling Nigerians in UAE that are being affected now is, you go out there condemn bad behaviour. Let it be known that those few do not represent who we are as a people. But when you sit down there and you don\u2019t call out those who do these things, then, the bad will definitely affect the good. But I am hoping that the issue of the UAE can be dealt with at the ministerial level, not at my level. However, UAE has said that there is no official policy on the issue.\n\nIn UAE and in other countries, no Nigerian will be allowed to be treated anyhow as instructed by Mr. President and we\u2019ve had a lot of interventions.\n\nBut NIDCOM does not deal with consular issues, it is basically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that deals with consular issues. So, in terms of being treated anyhow, once you don\u2019t commit a crime, we will intervene. But you cannot commit a crime, or break the laws and expect that we are going to beg for you.\n\nThe economic situation in Nigeria has made Nigerians endure indignities in different countries across the globe. How easy or difficult has this home situation made your work as head of NIDCOM?\n\nThis question is general. I\u2019ll take specific cases. In South Africa with the issue of xenophobia, Mr. President intervened himself, it was dealt with.\n\nWe dealt with the issue of Traders in Ghana and the President also sent a delegation.\n\nThe issue of Libya, and Nigerians languishing in Libyan detention centers for years, Mr President set up a committee headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go into detention camps in Libya. We brought thousands of Nigerians back. But guess what, despite all that, people are still going. We need massive awareness campaign. In Lebanon for instance, we brought stranded Nigerians back and one of the girls said to me \u201cI will rather be selling guguru (popcorn) under the bridge than go back there.\u201d\n\nSo, I think if people know that where they are running to is worse than where they are running from, they will have a rethink.\n\nWhat can be done to stem the rise of abuse of Nigerians by their host country?\n\nAny Nigerian, if you are unjustly abused, we will definitely intervene. We have intervened on many occasions. We will not allow you to suffer for a crime you didn\u2019t commit, period. We work with the missions to ensure that no Nigerian is treated unjustly and we also reject stereotyping of Nigerians. If A commits a crime deal with it, don\u2019t say because A committed a crime, you punish B for that because he is a Nigerian. That is not going to happen. We as Nigerians must reject that stereotype.\n\nBut, please, if you don\u2019t obey laws in your own country, you can\u2019t go to another man\u2019s country and disobey. It is as simple as that, but we have definitely been intervening in cases where Nigerians have been affected. Many of them are not even in the media. When we get complaints, we work directly with the missions and a whole lot of times, we get results.\n\nNigeria hasn\u2019t been this divided since Independence, and fingers point at what is generally regarded as poor leadership at the center. What do you make of it?\n\nLeadership has its own role, followership also has its own role. So, let\u2019s look at it holistically. I think as a people, what are our values? What are our morals? What are the things that matter to us? So, I look at it holistically, yes, leadership is a problem, but so is followership. There has to be better participatory democracy, and for the elites in particular who sit back and say \u201coh, I won\u2019t get involved,\u201d to know it is wrong. It is also important for the citizens to demand the best of their leaders.\n\nDo you share the growing notion that Nigeria may cease to exist if current multifaceted problems are not addressed urgently?\n\nI hope not because, Nigeria will emerge strong, but it has to be a united Nigeria, where merit counts, where it doesn\u2019t matter who you know or where you come from and one that will expose the best of your potentials.\n\nI believe that the kind of democracy, or system of government we are practicing now is not meant for us, but we are in it. What do we do to make it better? There has to be devolution of powers to the local and state levels. The strongest arm of government should be the local level. What would the federal government be doing with education in a local community like Imota for instance? I believe in devolution of power. Let powers devolve to the local level, and at that stage, you can have the very strongest in the community head the local government. I mean that is what federalism should be about. The kind of system we are operating now is not working for us, and will not not work for us until we take certain measures and that rests with the National Assembly. The National Assembly needs to look at both the exclusive and concurrent list in the constitution and review them such that more powers go to the local government. If you have a strong local government that is empowered and funded, we will solve a lot of problems.\n\nWhat would you say are the challenges you face as head of NIDCOM and how do you overcome them?\n\nThe greatest challenge is funding, you know it is a new agency, but we don\u2019t let that stop us. We are trying to work on gathering data but Nigerians abroad don\u2019t want to share their data. But we are working at building trust and confidence of Nigerians abroad knowing that it helps in planning.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the ways to help a country like Nigeria help itself, and relieve some of the pressures for emigration?\n\nMr. President is concentrating a lot on infrastructural development, creating the kind of environment where jobs can be created. This is what government is doing under the office of the Vice President, to encourage small businesses and startups. Although not everybody is looking for a job, because from the experience I have had, even if you have the jobs, there are some people who just believe that their destiny is abroad. Why would somebody that has three trailers, sell them for about 10 million naira, decides that he wants to relocate to Europe, gets stuck in Libya and then, comes back with nothing? We need a lot of awareness. It is not rosy out there. Go to the streets of Greece and see Africans including Nigerians, just roaming about; no jobs, they can\u2019t even speak the language and then, they are hawking and not selling anything. Like the lady from Lebanon said, she is better off selling guguru (popcorn) somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of education that we are providing is not making graduates startup on their own. So, the government has a role to play, but we also have our own roles to play too in letting that young person know not to fall victim of traffickers. So, a lot has to be done by government and us, but you can\u2019t stop migration. If I am below 30 and I find opportunities abroad, of course, I am going to go.\n\nSince your time at the National Assembly, female legislators have not been very vocal. What is happening with the women?\n\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal. There is a bill in place now to create over 100 seats dedicated to women and I think it was sponsored by Hon. Nkiruka. So I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number. When I was in parliament, we were 27; but now, I think they are just half the number both in the House and the Senate. Also, there are less women in political space in terms of leadership. We need to work at making it better.\n\nHow far would you say women have come in terms of politics, since independence?\n\nWe can do better and beyond tokenism which is what the two major parties- APC and PDP are doing now. You know there is no level- playing field, so, I encourage women, If you want a change, you need to leave your comfort zone and be part of politics. I don\u2019t mean you have to contest elections, just let your voices be heard. I started at the local level, attending ward meetings, before I decided to contest elections. If you know it is in you, you need to venture out to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are some cultural issues that still make it difficult for women in politics. But we can\u2019t give up, more women need to participat. So, join a political party, be a leader in your community, go to your ward level, get to know the grassroots, mingle with them, and get to know what is going on. The more women you have in the system, no matter what anybody says, when you give them a task, they deliver.\n\nYou are obviously a very busy woman when you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nI like to be home and to spend time with my family. I love music so I like to sing and dance. Music relaxes me and I try to exercise but a lot of times, you get to lazy to do it. But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",

          "title": "Abike Dabiri-Erewa: On Nigeria @ 61",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAs Nigeria gets set to celebrate her 61st independence anniversary on Thursday, 1st October, Nigeria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Diaspora Comission (NIDCOM), Hon Abike Dabiri Erewa in this exclusive interview, speaks on some salient issues currently plaguing the country.\n\nThe former House of Representatives Member, who was one of the most vocal voices, especially on the issues of women and children, also opens up on the place of women in politics today, her role and challenges as head of NIDCOM, the issue of migration and of course, the Nigeria of her dreams.\n\nNigeria will on October 1, turn 61 as a nation. At a time like this, do you think there is anything or reason to celebrate?\n\nOf course, there is every reason to celebrate; that we are alive today, that we have a country, and I tell you, it is a country to be proud of. There are challenges no doubt, but we must look at our strengths, rather than our weaknesses. We should look at what unites us rather than what separates us. So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there. But it\u2019s not about government alone, it is about every one of us, at home and in the diaspora, working together to build this great country of ours.\n\nMany Nigerians who trusted your party the APC to bring about change and move them to the next level have had their hopes dashed, with many opting to migrate to other countries. How can hope be rekindled again?\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate. You can\u2019t stop migration, legal or illegal. But, try to avoid irregular migration. And also, when you are in another man\u2019s country, it is important that you try to obey the laws of that country. In the UAE for instance, we are bombarded every day with complaints that UAE is not renewing work permits. But we went to see the UAE Ambassador, and he made it clear that there is no official policy from the UAE government about not renewing work permits. But Nigerians are still being denied work permits. In this situation for instance, it\u2019s a case of the bad now affecting the good.\n\nWhen you are in another man\u2019s country and you go to rob a bank in broad daylight in a place like UAE, I condemned it and I listed the names of the four Nigerians who committed the crime. I was criticized for mentioning their names. People felt it was because they were from a particular section of the country, but when you are out there, you are seen as Nigerian first before any tribe.\n\nThis is a country with laws and zero tolerance for crime. Now those guys are serving life imprisonment. In the same UAE, our brothers took cultism there, and they were killing themselves openly. We have seen a lot of things happen and now the bad is affecting the good.\n\nSo what I am telling Nigerians in UAE that are being affected now is, you go out there condemn bad behaviour. Let it be known that those few do not represent who we are as a people. But when you sit down there and you don\u2019t call out those who do these things, then, the bad will definitely affect the good. But I am hoping that the issue of the UAE can be dealt with at the ministerial level, not at my level. However, UAE has said that there is no official policy on the issue.\n\nIn UAE and in other countries, no Nigerian will be allowed to be treated anyhow as instructed by Mr. President and we\u2019ve had a lot of interventions.\n\nBut NIDCOM does not deal with consular issues, it is basically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that deals with consular issues. So, in terms of being treated anyhow, once you don\u2019t commit a crime, we will intervene. But you cannot commit a crime, or break the laws and expect that we are going to beg for you.\n\nThe economic situation in Nigeria has made Nigerians endure indignities in different countries across the globe. How easy or difficult has this home situation made your work as head of NIDCOM?\n\nThis question is general. I\u2019ll take specific cases. In South Africa with the issue of xenophobia, Mr. President intervened himself, it was dealt with.\n\nWe dealt with the issue of Traders in Ghana and the President also sent a delegation.\n\nThe issue of Libya, and Nigerians languishing in Libyan detention centers for years, Mr President set up a committee headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go into detention camps in Libya. We brought thousands of Nigerians back. But guess what, despite all that, people are still going. We need massive awareness campaign. In Lebanon for instance, we brought stranded Nigerians back and one of the girls said to me \u201cI will rather be selling guguru (popcorn) under the bridge than go back there.\u201d\n\nSo, I think if people know that where they are running to is worse than where they are running from, they will have a rethink.\n\nWhat can be done to stem the rise of abuse of Nigerians by their host country?\n\nAny Nigerian, if you are unjustly abused, we will definitely intervene.

          "title": "Mmekidmfon Umanah\u2026Building a healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWith Africa\u2019s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, Nigerian born UK based Mmekidmfon Umanah, is on a mission to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system via his project company; Aimcare Health Limited a product sourcing company that is building the healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa by connecting European health startups to the unique market opportunities in West Africa.\n\nA Chevening alumnus with an MSc in International Development from the University of Birmingham, with an incoming PhD in Business and Management candidate at the King\u2019s College London, Mmekidmfon also serves as the Executive Director of WaterEase Organization, a nonprofit using resource mobilisation and advocacy to help underserved communities have better access to clean water in Nigeria.\n\nSo far, through his advocacy work, four communities in have been provided with clean water, with a community in Bauchi as the latest beneficiary.\n\nMmekidmfon shares his motivating factor and overall mission for his work.\n\nWhat is the motive behind the creation of Aimcare? What inspired it?\n\nThe truth is that the African healthcare system is simply broken, and this cost me my mother\u2019s life in 2013. For 80% of people in Africa, their community pharmacy and patent medicine stores are the frontlines of their health system and, yet they routinely stock out of essential medicines, incur significant losses to expiry, and struggle with substandard and falsified drugs and medical consumables. Where immunizations, contraceptives, anti-infectives, essential devices, and diagnostics, or chronic-care at the local clinic or pharmacy are expired, too expensive, or simply unavailable, providers, patients, and whole communities pay the price; we are currently working to prevent these. . Hence, I am committed to tackling this issue through Aimcare, working our way up from just inventory access and financing to infrastructure financing.\n\nWe are ensuring that consumers have access to the best and most innovative products in the market regardless of their location or economic status.\n\nAnd how do you go about achieving your goal?\n\nAimcare Health Limited\u2019s mission is to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system by providing pharmacies, primary healthcare centres, patent medicine stores and hospitals with the most innovative, user-friendly, and affordable products in the global market. We are currently doing this by connecting global health start-ups to unique and high-potential opportunities on the African continent. We focus on non-clich\u00e9 opportunities in the healthcare ecosystem from piloting disruptive technology to marketing innovative consumer products and wearables. By leveraging on our unique partnership channels, we have built access to 1000 pharmacies, 200 patient medicine stores and 50 clinics.\n\nDot Glasses is one of the foreign start-ups we are working with. We are their sole partners in Nigeria and we are enabling the facilities as listed above to get access to this affordable yet quality vision care solution.\n\nHow is Aimcare financed?\n\nAimcare is a for-profit startup and primarily we make money from our services. For a while, people used to erroneously think we are a non-profit, and possibly this came from the fact that we are involved with a lot of impact projects. For instance, we have a project that involves distributing birth kits to pregnant women in rural communities through the traditional birth attendant homes and distributing hygiene kits to boarding secondary schools. The reality though is that these projects are now part of our non-profit vehicle\u2019s (Waterease) value proposition and no more Aimcare directly.\n\nAt what point did the Dot Glasses project come in and what informed it?\n\nAimcare currently has an exclusive partnership with a Czech based company called DOT Glasses, tell us about it?\n\nDOT Glasses is a Czech-based vision Care Company that has developed proprietary on-spot testing that allows us to test, diagnose and provide our customised prescription lenses on the spot all in less than 4 minutes for a total cost of $4. DOT Glasses is the first sustainable solution to the world\u2019s vision problem. With their patented, snap-together, adjustable frames designed by a subsidiary of Mercedes Benz; Impact and scratch-resistant lenses; simple proprietary vision testing tools; and extraordinarily robust 100% injection-molded ABS plastic, they ensure the end-user has access to quality prescription lenses at an ultra-affordable rate.\n\nTell us your achievement with DOT glasses project in Nigeria?\n\nFrom inception to-date we have sold about six thousand five-hundred DOT glasses and partnered with some non-commercial partners like Akwa Ibom State government and the Ini Ememobong Foundation to distribute 500 for free. We have in the process provided eye tests for one thousand people. We\u2019ve partnered with the government and private companies to distribute 7000 pairs of these glasses since March this year\n\nFrom all you have done, your projects seem to focus more on the northern part of Nigeria, why is that so and when are you extending to other parts of the country?\n\nWe do have some presence in the North. We have partners in Kebbi, Zaria and Abuja. Also, A few months ago, Aimcare\u2019s non-profit vehicle; Waterease Organisation, provided clean water to the good people of Dasham Community in Bauchi State by building them a borehole. That project will provide water to 700 people in and around that community. However, our biggest business comes from Lagos. Most of our commercial partners are in Lagos.\n\nWhat is your future projection for Aimcare?\n\nAs far as future projections go, our midterm goal is to disrupt the industry by helping primary healthcare facilities avoid stock outs and have uninterrupted access to inventory. We want to be able to improve access to medicines and medical products by providing innovative financing and inventory management solutions to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.\n\nOur long term goal is to be able to facilitate healthcare investment to the continent by financing infrastructure.\n\nYou are gradually bridging the gap in the healthcare sector, using Aimcare in providing opportunities, what have been the challenges you have encountered so far?\n\nThe challenges we are facing are perhaps not significantly different from the challenges many businesses in Nigeria are facing. For instance, our business is very reliant on FX and a few months ago we were doing business at N400 to $1. Currently we are doing business at N510 to $1. This makes things very difficult especially for companies like us aiming to ensure the prices of our products are super affordable.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and what events shaped you into the person you are today?\n\nGrowing was fun. We did not have a lot, but my parents ensured I got the best education I could possibly have gotten. I attended private schools at both nursery and primary and secondary school levels. I remember that my secondary school was quite pricey at the time, and it makes me wonder how my parents were able to afford, as I look back in retrospect.\n\nI generally had a slow start in life; I could not read a timepiece until I was about 10, 11 years old. But as an only child, my mother\u2019s support was relentless. She used to call me Doctor and always wanted me to be a Doctor. I hope as she looks down from heaven, she is proud that I am on my way to getting a Doctorate and I\u2019ll truly be called a Doctor even though it is not medical. But even importantly, I hope she is even more proud that I am running a successful healthcare start-up that is tackling some of the things that cost her life.",

          "text": "Truck drivers plying Maiduguri \u2013 Konduga \u2013 Bama \u2013 Banki Road, which is approximately 150km are said to be spending an estimated Seven Billion and Five Hundred Million Naira yearly on the deplorable roads burdened by constant attacks by Islamic State for West African Province, ISWAP fighters and members of the Jama\u2019atul Ahalil Sunnah also known as JAS.\n\nSheikh Abdallah Yerwama, a Borno indigene who made the observation from his research on spending by the truck drivers said the Federal government can save the future of the Nigerian youths if it takes into consideration ways to secure the road and also generate revenue from them.\n\nHe said \u201cIf I were the Federal Government, I will rent out the entire highway to willing investors since I cannot invest, officially, put up levies to increase revenue instead of allowing the money to go into few hands of uniform and un-uniform men that are in charge of these roads on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nTaking a measurement and evaluation analysis of the amount of money spent on the road, he calculated the average mean per day to arrive at N250,000.00, each for 250 truck, translated to N62,500,000.00. Adding that, in x 10 days the result could be as much as N625,000,000.00 and in x 12 months getting to an estimation of about N7,500,000,000.00 (Seven Billion and Five Hundred Million Naira).\n\nHe said, \u201cthis is approximately what is being generated along that route alone. And if other routes are to be put together with the data available of what these truck drivers spend daily, Borno State can comfortably reduce burdens on other project seeking government attention where the resources are limited for the execution of such projects.\u201d\n\nOur Correspondent also spoke with some citizens who shared the same view as observed by Mr. Abdallah Yerwama looking at the statistical presentation of his argument on the need for government to look into this source of revenue generation for the state.\n\nWhile speaking on the observation, Adamu Ibrahim an M&E Specialist in Borno said with the deplorable condition of the roads in Borno and the increasing insecurity on the road, the government maybe thinking differently but this is an opportunity for government to look into this observation and beginning to make sense of it to generate more revenue for the state.\n\n\u201cI believe there are investors who may be willing to invest their monies onto ventures like this. And this is not about the short term but looking at the long term plan. If these roads according to the observation and evaluation made can bring this amount of money on a year, I can tell you that this is good business.\n\n\u201cBut the problem with our business men is that no one wants to take such risk and if any investor come now and begin to make money out of this, they will come with hammer on such investor especially if he is not an indigene or even if indigene there would be attacks from some quota by vested interest who wants to go into such businesses because it is succeeding.\u201d He said.",

          "text": "Former Minister of Youth Development and Sports, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, has advised the Kwara State government to dump its plan to appeal the judgment of the High Court in Ilorin which sacked the 16 Local Government Transitional Implementation/ Caretaker Committees in the state.\n\nIt would be recalled that the State High Court on Friday delivered judgment on the case initiated by a state-based civil society group, Elite Network for Sustainable Development, ENETSUD, against the state government for sacking the democratically elected officials of the state local governments and replacing them with appointed officials of its own.\n\nDelivering judgment in favour of the plaintiff, the Court described the government\u2019s action as \u201cexecutive rascality.\u201d\n\nThe state government, speaking through the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Barrister Salman Jawondo, had however promptly responded to the judgment, declaring it as \u201creasoning of the court\u201d and promised that the state government was ready to file an appeal.\n\nHowever, in his reaction on the issue, Abdullahi, urged the state government to obey the court ruling and abandon its plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement issued in Ilorin on Sunday, the former Minister described the government\u2019s plan to appeal as a \u201cclassic filibuster act, calculated to waste everybody\u2019s time even at tax payers\u2019 expense.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe judgment of the High Court on the issue of local government administration in Kwara State has been widely hailed by majority of Kwarans and all lovers of democracy everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State Government would therefore do well to obey the court ruling and call for an election immediately.\n\n\u201cHowever, going by the posturing of the state government since the judgment was issued, it does appear that for whatever reasons, government would rather persist on what the court has rightly described as \u201cexecutive rascality\u201d rather than submit itself to any kind of democratic assessment.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State Attorney General already described the High Court judgment as a \u201creasoning of the court\u201d and promised to pursue the matter to the appellate courts. But this is a case that the Supreme court itself had already settled.\n\n\u201cIn a similar case in 2019, the Supreme Court had this to say: \u201cAn elected person is not an employee of anybody except the electorate that voted him into office. It is only the electorate who can fire him.\n\n\u201cIn the instant case, Councilors derive their mandate from the people who voted them in and are accountable to them\u2026 Since Section 7(1) of the 1999 Constitution guarantees a system of Local Government Councils, then dissolution of Local Government Councils by Governor of a State and the appointment of Caretaker Committees to replace same is inconsistent with that section and is therefore null and void.\u201d\n\nFollowing the declaration by the Supreme Court, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami in a January 2020 memo notified the states that the practice of running Caretaker Committees in place of elected officials at the local government level is illegal and that in view of the Supreme Court ruling on the matter, it has become \u201cobligatory\u201d for all the states concerned to \u201cimmediately disband all Caretaker Committees and restore democratically elected representatives to man the Local Government.\n\n\u201c By way of emphasis, the AGF concluded as follow: \u201cThe common practice by some State Governors in dissolving elected local government councils is unconstitutional, null and void\u2026So, also any system of local government run by Caretaker Committees are outrightly illegal and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the Kwara State Government must be aware of the Supreme Court ruling of 2019 as well as the memo issued by the Federal Attorney General of the ruling party that they both belong.\n\n\u201cTherefore, if the Kwara State Government proceeds to appeal the High Court ruling even in the face of this overwhelming evidence, it would be clear that the government only wants to play for time.\n\n\u201cIt is a classic filibuster act, calculated to waste everybody\u2019s time even at tax payers\u2019 expense,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe former sports minister, said the next step is for the state government to apply for injunction to keep its illegal TIC in place while it lounges its way through the courts, armed with the spurious argument that every case is unique, but the government knows it cannot win this case.\n\nHe said it was not too late to change course, adding that the State Government should abandon the wooden headed plan to appeal the ruling of the High Court and call for an election without any further delay.",

In the process, the animals utterly destroy the crops as they voraciously eat the leafy greens.\n\nSo, when in May 2021, Southern governors met in Asaba, the Delta State capital, and passed a resolution announcing a total ban on open grazing of cattle in their states, they also set September 1, 2021 as deadline for each state to pass laws to authenticate the ban. With the exception of just a few, several Southern states have enacted laws against open grazing.\n\nHowever, in terms of implementation of the anti-open grazing laws, reports from various states showed that the new laws appear to be mere window dressing aimed at appealing to the electorate, given that the states lack capacity to enforce them. The laws placed on the police and other security agencies the burden of enforcing the ban. In essence, the ban on open grazing has been akin to the case of the toothless bulldog that can bark, but not bite, as the power of enforcement still lies with the Federal Government due to its exclusive control over the Police and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nRIVERS\n\nIn Rivers State, Livingstone Wechie, a community leader and public analyst, opined that the law cannot be truly enforced as the Commissioner of Police is not legally bound to carry out the directives of the state governor without clearing from the Inspector General of Police in Abuja.\n\nWechie said that compliance with the law has been very low as there have been several confrontations between the farmers and herders in Eleme and Ahoada areas of the state.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected the southern governors to work and build security systems with community-based structures to protect our farmers from these marauding attacks. We still hear cases of the farmers being killed by these terrorist-herders the Federal Government claims are foreigners,\u201d Wechie said.\n\nReports gathered from several communities alleged that some of the herders are being escorted by the military, thereby instilling fear in the community dwellers. Some rural dwellers confided in Sunday Sun that the so-called herders have the full protection of \u201cpowers from above.\u201d\n\nThey frowned at the energetic efforts of the Federal Government in opposing the ban on open grazing without seeing anything wrong in the horrendous damage being done to crop farmers by the herders.\n\n\u201cThe cattle are more protected because the cow\u2019s life matter more than human lives. This stance of the Federal Government has continued to embolden the herders knowing that the government has assured them full protection. This may force the communities to resort to an avoidable option.\n\nIMO\n\nEncouraged by the position of Governor Hope Uzodimma, Fulani herders still openly graze their cattle in the streets, roads in the state as well as uncultivated farmlands.\n\nAlthough reported cases of herders-farmers clash have subsided, most residents in the state still express fears that the present calm may be transient as the armed marauding herders may revert to their old ways without real provocation.\n\nOne of the residents who simply gave his name as Mr Collins said: \u201cWe have not experienced trouble from these people for some time, they move about on the roads and in my area, Oforala in Owerri-West Council Area, we have not had any trouble with them. But we don\u2019t know how long this will last; maybe tomorrow they will go back to their old ways. The state government should join other Southern governors in condemning open grazing in Imo.\u201d\n\nOn the presence of vigilante in the state, a farmer acknowledged that there is no strong vigilante service in the state. \u201cThey were scared away by the state government which promised to float local vigilante in the rural areas. We are still waiting for that to happen,\u201d the farmer said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ebubeagu security outfit announced by the Southeast governors with fanfare is yet to commence operation in the state.\n\nEBONYI\n\nThree years before the Southern Governors Forum resolved to ban open grazing of cattle, Ebonyi State had since 2018 enacted the Ebonyi Miscellaneous Offences Law against it.\n\nSunday Sun learnt from the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Cletus Ofoke, that the enactment of the law followed a meeting between the government and the leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), to deliberate on ways of ending attacks by herders on farmers.\n\nOfoke, chairman of the Ebonyi State Committee on Herders and Farmers Relationship, noted that the 2018 law addressed all the salient issues relating to farmers and herders activities in terms of open grazing and underage grazing.\n\nDespite the existence of the 2018 law, herders have continued to clash with farmers in some parts of the state. Then in April 2021, herders killed over 30 persons in Egedegede community in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe incident, it was gathered, followed a clash between the Fulani herders and farmers in Ishielu communities. The incident generated a lot of concern across the country, prompting the herders in the state to leave on their own accord for fear of repraisal attacked.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, Governor David Umahi said that security reports confirmed that the herders had left Ishielu. Since that unfortunate incident there has been no clash between herders and farmers anywhere in the state since May this year.\n\nANAMBRA\n\nIn a seeming act of defiance, herdsmen still move around various parts of the state, including Awka, the state capital, to graze their cattle at night when the roads are virtually empty. Most residents only see the cow dung litter the paved roads in the morning.\n\nChairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Southeast, Gidado Siddiki, told Sunday Sun that the arrangement put together by the Anambra State Cattle Menace Committee was still operational and would likely remain so until a bill, entitled: \u201cOpen Grazing of Cattle and Other Livestock Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Bill,\u201d which has been before the House of Assembly, is passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor. It is aimed at banning open grazing in the state.\n\nUnder the arrangement, herdsmen pay compensation to farmers whenever their cattle stray into the farms and destroy crops. It\u2019s the same way when a farmer kills a cow.\n\nHe, however, told Sunday Sun that his people became confused when the bill surfaced in the state House of Assembly.\n\nHe said that they are confused on the next step to take or what would happen when the bill becomes a law.\n\n\u201cEverybody is confused. First of all, a bill has been proposed and our people have no alternative. They have been doing this their business for years. So, they have no alternative because the bill will soon become a law.\n\n\u201cFor now, we have no challenge, but what we are scared of is, you know that some people are ignorant of what the bill is. So, when they hear that the House of Assembly has passed a bill, some people may use that opportunity to attack our people.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened yet. I am not saying that they\u2019re attacking our people, no! Nobody has attacked our people, but we don\u2019t know what the consequences of that bill will be when it becomes a law\u201d, Siddiki said.\n\nOSUN\n\nHerdsmen in Osun State are not fully obeying the anti-open grazing law signed by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, Sunday Sun has gathered.\n\nThey still move around with their cows and no punishment has been meted out to any violators of the law. However, there appears to be a good relationship between the government and the herders, and there is relative peace.\n\nThe chairman, Committee on Fulani/Bororo and Crop Farmers, Hon. Mudashiru Togun, who spoke with Sunday Sun, said that there has been no confrontation between farmers and herders in the state.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any problem in Osun with or without anti-open grazing law. There is no issue at all. Osun has been peaceful and will continue to be peaceful. As far as herders/farmers are concerned, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d Togun stated.\n\nA farmer at Antakiti farm, along Ikirun road, Osogbo, Mr Isiaka Isamotu, confirmed to Sunday Sun that the herders still move around with their cattle.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have had issues and we fought seriously. But now, they are very careful to avoid entering farms. Though they still move around, I doubt if they are aware of the said law.\u201d\n\nThe Seriki Fulani in Osogbo, Ibrahim Babatunde, said that his members are moving about with their cattle because there has been no issue with the people, even before the law.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem between my members and the farmers. We have warned our people not to go to the major roads and they should not enter peoples\u2019 farms. If not because of strangers that are causing the problem, we don\u2019t have issues with farmers because we know that we are going to pay damages if our cattle eat crops in farms.\u201d\n\nThe Special Adviser to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Civic Engagement, Hon. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, who held a stakeholder meeting with Serikis and all herders to sensitize them on the law, said that the level of compliance has been commendable.\n\nHe attributed the success of the peace to the continuous engagement and sensitization, adding that a mechanism has been put in place to receive complaints from farmers.\n\n\u201cThere is continuous engagement with all social strata, non-indigenes, particularly the Fulani. We are seriously having a good relationship with them. We swing into action immediately we receive any report about any issue between farmers and herders. This has helped us a lot,\u201d Oyintiloye told Sunday Sun in a chat.\n\nThe Chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAM), Osun State chapter, Alhaji Sulaiman Araokanmi, said that the herders have complied to some extent, saying that farmers have not been complaining the way they used to lament before the law was signed.\n\nHe said that the farmers are also planning to select 10 representatives while the herders will also present 10 in each local government to discuss and agree on terms to complement the effort of the government at sustaining peace.\n\nOGUN\n\nThere has been observable reduction in open grazing in Ogun State, even though enforcement of the law against it, recently signed by Governor Dapo Abiodun, is yet to commence. The new law made provision for a six-month transition period. Open grazing is becoming minimal. Before the signing of the law, herders were often sighted grazing their cattle in residential areas and farms, particularly those close to the rivers. The law allows people or corporate bodies to obtain permits from the state to set up ranches.\n\nA resident of the state, Abayomi Arabambi, a public affairs analyst, told Sunday Sun that people are waiting for the expiration of the six months grace period to see how effective enforcement of the law would be.\n\nDELTA\n\nThere appears to be a lull in the clashes between crop farmers and herdsmen across communities in Delta State. Yet, herders still move about with cattle in residential areas particularly within semi-urban areas in the state, even though Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has signed the \u2018Delta State Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Law 2021.\n\nThe enactment of the law has created confusion among Hausa/Fulani community in the state as they claimed that they have not been adequately educated on the subject matter.\n\nThere appears to be apprehension among the Hausa/Fulani that they might be attacked by overzealous members of local vigilante in attempt to enforce the law.\n\nChairman of the Cattle Dealers Association in the state, Musa Shuwa, said that they have been kept in the dark as far as the new law is concerned, noting that the development was creating panic among those in the marketing of cattle.\n\n\u201cThere is a big problem, now many people want to return, our traders and others, it is a very serious matter. The situation is very dangerous, we are afraid of these local vigilantes, maybe our people would be attacked.\n\n\u201cThe business is under serious threat. Before now, cows will come from Cameroon to Adamawa and then we bring them to the South for sale. But now from Adamawa, cows are being returned to Cameroon.\n\n\u201cThe people are afraid because if we bring cows to the Southeast, we might be attacked and our cows rustled. We are traders, the market they give us is too small, so we told our people to stop bringing cattle. But I have told my people to hold on and observe the situation because we don\u2019t have any other place to go from Delta. I have been doing my business in Asaba for over 40 years, most of us have investments here and our children attend schools here.\n\n\u201cHowever, as we speak now, government has not shown us any designated area for our business; they just left us in the dark. I appeal to government to critically look into these issues and invite us for discussion,\u201d Shuwa said.\n\nAlso, Mr Maikudi Ningi said that the people have not be properly educated on the new law and what is expected of those in the livestock business, noting however that as residents, they were prepared to obey the laws of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the state government said that the enforcement of the law might not commence immediately.\n\nThrowing light on this, Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, said that it would take another period of time before implementation could start properly.\n\n\u201cNo state can even start implementation immediately because after passing the bill and assenting to it, you need to give people time to adjust. You need to give the herders time to either return their cattle or build ranches,\u201d Aniagwu explained.\n\nCorroborating Aniagwu\u2019s views, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Okowa, Olisa Ifeajika, said that a lot of sensitisation would be carried out to properly educate the people before full enforcement would start.\n\nENUGU\n\nFollowing the passage of the \u201cBill to Prohibit Open Grazing, Regulate Cattle Ranching and for Connected Purposes,\u201d into law on Thursday, September 2, by the Enugu State House of Assembly, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi assented to it on Tuesday, September 14.\n\nSince the law came into force, the state has not recorded any incident between herders and farmers.\n\nAccording to some natives in the rural areas where the menace of the herders used to be pronounced, though the Fulani herdsmen have not stopped open grazing, they seem to be more careful and cautious now.\n\nA farmer from Ukpabi Nimbo in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area, Chief James Enechi said that since the attack at Adani by unknown gunmen where some soldiers were killed and a Police Station burnt, they have not been seeing the herdsmen again around their area.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor some time now the herdsmen are no more seen around our place here and that was since that problem at Adani. Fulani herdsmen are no longer here. Since that incident, we don\u2019t hear of them again.\u201d\n\nAnother farmer from Opanda who pleaded anonymity said that \u201cpeace has returned to our area for some time now maybe it might be because of the new law. We don\u2019t see the herdsmen often like before; these days they graze slightly along Opanda and then move into Kogi.\u201d\n\nSome other people said that the herders were still grazing openly around the bushes and forests of the state without any question.\n\nBut speaking about the mood among the herders since the bill was signed into law, the Chairman Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Southeast Zone, Alhaji Gidado Siddiki said that it has not been easy for them.\n\nHe, however, confirmed that they were still grazing openly, but with serious caution to their members to avoid destruction of food crops.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe life is not easy, everybody is in fear, but nothing has started happening, our people are just grazing as they were doing before. We have told them that they have to be careful about destruction of food crops. We said that if they did not destroy anything, all these things will not even arise.\n\n\u201cThe law has been passed, we are law-abiding citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we have to abide, but we are scared, let some people not use the opportunity because there is a law and start attacking my people. But as at now nothing is happening.\n\n\u201cAlready there is an existing Committee in the Government House Unit which the governor appointed which is always mediating between the herdsmen and the farmers and up till now they are resolving matters.\n\n\u201cSo what we are saying is that we are not against the law, but what we are saying is that we need to get another alternative. If you say stop what you are doing then you need to get something that we will be doing. If they can get us how we can drop our cow, we will train our people, but it will take a long time at least five or six years to train our boys for them to acquire lands where they can build this modern system. Things have changed and we most change, but it has to be gradual, it cannot be done abruptly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, nobody has been arrested over the anti-open grazing law and nothing has been seen in the area of any move to make ranches.\n\nABIA\n\nDespite Governor Okezie Ikpeazu signing the bill on anti-open grazing, passed by the state House of Assembly, into law, Fulani herdsmen are still moving about with their cattle in every nook and cranny of the state as if there was no law against the practice.\n\nThe most worrisome aspect is what is happening in the heart of the commercial city of Aba. In the Waterside axis of the city, the herders intermittently march their animals along the stretch of Ikot Ekpene road, a major entry point to the city.\n\nMovement of cattle on this popular road from where they get to their various grazing points, apart from creating an eyesore with the dung splattered along the road, they equally constitute enormous nuisance to the commuting public, with the attendant hazards as most accidents that occur on that portion of the road, 80 per cent are attributed to the movement of these animals on the road.\n\nApart from enacting the law and tinkering with the idea of relocating the abattoir at Waterside and re-establishing the cow market there at Ukwa West, which it has lacked the political will to actualize, the state government has actually not done much to enforce the law, and no violator has been arrested for contravening the law.\n\nThe state government has, however, extricated itself from blame in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, it was the duty of security agencies in the state to enforce laws of the land, including the anti-open grazing law. But this is not being done. The result is that the people are still at the mercy of the herders in the state.\n\nA farmer from Umuobasi Ukwu, Ozuitem, in Bende Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Maduka said they were still suffering in the hands of the herders as their cows continue to destroy their crops. He said they chose to keep quiet for peace to reign because the last time the villagers had issues with the herders, police supported the herders.\n\n\u201cThat we kept quiet this while doesn\u2019t mean all has been well with us. The last time we had issues with them, the police was on their side, so we have decided to apply wisdom this time around.\u201d\n\nAnother farmer, Peter Egbuta from Umuhu Ezechi, one of the communities serving as pasturing fields for the herders, their crops are being continually destroyed by cattle. He appealed to the government to do something to save them from the herders.\n\nAs the anti-open grazing law is not being enforced, coupled with the \u201csuffering and smiling\u201d attitude of the natives, having been so presented with conducive atmosphere in Abia, the herders have nowhere to relocate to but are instead occupying deeper portions of the forests of Abia North and grazing their cows along which ever route they choose, unhindered.\n\nWith the free hands given to herdsmen to operate in the state, they go to any length with their cattle in search of fresh grasses.\n\nCROSS RIVERS\n\nHerders in Cross River State are still moving around with their cows grazing openly in defiance of the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum.\n\nThey have been emboldened in this regard by the fact that Governor Ben Ayade has not yet signed the Anti-Open Grazing Bill passed by the House of Assembly in 2017 into law.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. William Jonah Eteng, had disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass law against open grazing.\n\nHe said the House still stands by the law and urged the governor to sign it into law considering the security situation in the country.\n\nThe absence of the law has caused some confrontations between herders and farmers in some communities in the state.\n\nInvestigations by Sunday Sun revealed that there is a feud between cattle herders and youths of Nde community in Ikom and in Biase communities.\n\nThe youths of Ikom and some community leaders are said to have risen against the massive destruction of farmlands in their place and, therefore, gave the herders ultimatum to evacuate their cattle.\n\nThere has been tension since the ultimatum expired on September 30, 2021, with the youths insisting that the herders must leave their land.\n\nVillage source said the security operatives give cover to the herders and even manhandle the youths in the community for daring to confront the herders.\n\nThe lawmaker representing Ikom II State Constituency in the State Assembly, Hon. Elvert Ayambem, admitted that there is growing tension in the community due the clashes between the herders and the youths and if not handled urgently it may escalate.\n\nIn Biase community, the story is the same as herders and farmers have also clashed and the community have also asked the herders to leave the community.\n\nA community leader in Obubra, Chief Samuel Agbor, said that it is surprising that the herders are just moving freely in the state as if nobody matters.\n\nOYO\n\nThe convener, Igangan Development Advocates (IDA) in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state, Diran Oladokun, told Sunday Sun, that for the past few months, there has not been open grazing of cattle in Aiyete, Tapa and Igangan.\n\nHowever, there has not been implementation of the anti-Open Grazing Law in the state, adding that the pressure from the powers that be from the federal level is applying.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nHe stated that the state government needs the support of all and sundry to implement the anti-Open Grazing Law, which according to the Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Security Matters, Mr Fatai Owoseni, a former Commissioner of Police in Lagos and Benue states, was already in existence before all the governors in the Southern part of Nigeria, agreed to ban open grazing in their states.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Geoffrey Anyanwu (Enugu), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), George Onyejiuwa (Owerri), Okey Sampson (Umuahia) and Obinna Odogwu (Awka)\n\nMany families are in grief in Ohaozara and Onicha Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State, following the bloody invasion of Isu and Onicha Igboeze communities by murderous gunmen on Thursday, October 7, 2021.\n\nNo fewer than 10 persons lost their lives in the bloody attack, including two policemen killed by the daredevils when they attacked Isu police station.\n\nA young lawyer, Aja Ogbonnaya Aja, his client; Ogbonnaya Abani and another person, from the neighbouring Okposi community in Ohaozara LGA, who were heading for the High Court at Obiozara were marched out of their vehicle and shot dead. Not even the pleas of the lawyer who just wedded in April this year with his wife said to be carrying about seven months pregnancy could save them, as the heartless criminals pumped hot bullets into their victims.\n\nThe gunmen were said to have burnt the Lexus sports utility vehicle they came with and left the area with the lawyer\u2019s vehicle.\n\nThere have been killings in Onicha Igboeze in the last three months by gunmen and security agents.\n\nLast month, a 27-year-old woman and daughter of the traditional ruler of the community, Elizabeth Agwu, was hit by a bullet when policemen invaded the community to arrest a suspect. She died as a result of the bullet which got her on the abdomen.\n\nBefore this period, yet-to-be identified gunmen had on Monday, August 9, 2021, the first day of the sit-at-home order called by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to press for the release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, killed at least eight persons at Anike Onicha in Onicha Igboeze.\n\nThe killings took place at about 6:00a.m on that black Monday: the victims were going about their normal businesses when they were accosted, attacked, killed and their vehicles, motorcycles and other valuable property burnt.\n\nTwo of the victims were natives of Anike Onicha, while one hailed from Ezza North Area of the state, but resident in Onicha where he traded in household items. The rest were people from different parts of the country passing through Onicha. The incident had caused serious panic and fear within the community and its environs especially as the identity of the perpetrators were not ascertained.\n\nHowever, police in the state accused the pro-Biafra group, IPOB, of masterminding the killing while enforcing its sit-at-home order in the area.\n\nA family member of Eze Nwangwu, who was among the people killed in the attack told our correspondent on phone that investigation conducted by the community indicated that the attack was properly planned.\n\nThe family source who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cThat day at about 6:00a.m our brother was attacked and killed alongside seven other persons. The incident happened within 30 minutes. The criminals camped inside the bush along the road. One of the survivors who narrated the story told us that they had blocked the road and were taking people into the bush where they killed them. They wore masks and dressed in black overall. At the end, two youths were killed in Anike.\u201d\n\nAsked if the victims had been buried, he said no, adding that the delay was occasioned by the inability of the police to release their bodies.\n\n\u201cThey have not been buried because the police refused to release the bodies to us. But I can confirm to you now that all that have been resolved and they will be buried on 26 and 27 of October,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the bereaved families mourn their beloved ones whose lives were cut short be some bloodthirsty goons, the Police in Ebonyi State said they were on the trail of the assailants.\n\nConsultant to Ebonyi State Government on Internal Security who is also in charge of the South East Security Network, Ebubeagu, in the state, Chief Stanley Okroemegha, told Sunday Sun that the outfit has been working in harmony with other security agencies to arrest the situation.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe efforts of the police and Ebubeagu have paid off as some of the perpetrators of that killing have been arrested. Our men are always patrolling all parts of the state to ensure that people are not harassed or attacked by unknown persons. And I can assure you that we will continue to do our best to ensure the security of lives and property in the state.\u201d\n\nThe foregoing scenario clearly showed that the security situation in the Southeast has almost deteriorated. Policemen and other security agents are randomly attacked and killed at checkpoints and in their stations. Civilians are equally attacked and killed by rampaging gunmen.\n\nIn fact, no state can be said to be free from the growing bloodbath in the region and security agencies are apparently not on top of the situation. As gunmen continue to spread sorrow in the Southeast, the people of the region are living in fear and uncertainty.\n\nAnambra: A new killing field\n\nSince this year, more than 20 people including policemen, naval officers, a staff of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) and civilians have been killed by gunmen in parts of Anambra State.\n\nAlso, property worth several millions including police stations, patrol vehicles, and others have been destroyed by the attackers even as guns and other security gadgets belonging to the security operatives were taken away.\n\nThe first attack by gunmen in Anambra this year was on February 24, when four policemen said to be on duty in Mkpologwu and Omogho communities in Aguata and Orumba North Local Government Areas respectively were dastardly killed and their patrol vehicles set ablaze. The attackers also reportedly made away with their victims\u2019 guns.\n\nBut while the matter was still raging, gunmen struck again on March 18, killing three policemen on duty at a location in Neni community, Anaocha LGA of the state and carted away their rifles. They also set their patrol vehicles ablaze.\n\nOn the same day, three naval personnel on duty at Awkuzu, Oyi LGA were attacked and killed. Their guns and other military equipment were equally taken away by their killers.\n\nOn March 19, gunmen attacked a vehicle belonging to the Nigeria Correctional Service on court duty, killing one staffer and a policewoman who joined the vehicle from the court in Ekwulobia.\n\nThese killings and burning of police stations continued until about three months ago when there was what looked like a break. Within the short period of the break, the residents of Anambra with the exception of Awka which witnessed a few more cult related killings, had some reprieve.\n\nHowever, there was a resurgence last month, in what could be termed the return of gunmen in Anambra. This time around, security operatives were not just targeted, eminent persons and politicians were not spared.\n\nDr. Chike Akunyili, the husband of the erstwhile Director-General of the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the late Prof. Dora Akunyili and his colleague, Dr. Lawrence Ezenwa, were among high profile murders in two separate attacks by gunmen lately. Also, the convoy of House of Representatives member, Chris Azubuogu, was attacked and his driver killed, within the same period. A police station was attacked in Ajali, also in the state, among others.\n\nOne of the latest victims whose death deeply pained Anambra people and Nigerians generally was Dr Akunyili.\n\nThe medical doctor was said to be returning from an event in Onitsha axis where he had received a posthumous award on behalf of his late wife before the gunmen killed him around Nkpor.\n\nBefore the killing of Akunyili and Ezenwa, the traditional ruler of Mkpunando community in Aguleri, Anambra East LGA, Igwe Alex Edozieuno, was assassinated alongside his driver whose name was simply given as Chukwuemeka.\n\nThey were killed on September 10, 2021 after Ezu River Bridge along Onitsha-Otuocha-Adani Road while returning from a visit.\n\nEven, his son, Prince Chinedu Edozieuno, has, since, raised the alarm over threat to his own life. Chinedu told newsmen that those who killed his father were trailing him. He said that he had received a number of threat messages from the suspect who had asked him to stop searching for who killed his father.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has since tagged the former monarch\u2019s death a politically motivated one.\n\nDirector General of Andy Uba Campaign Council, Paul Chukwuma, and the state chairman of the party, Chief Basil Ejidike, at a press conference in Awka, said that the deposed monarch was killed not long after he publicly joined the APC.\n\nThe attacks by gunmen in the state last Sunday also consumed the Nnewi residential home of Chief Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the APC and aide to the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nOn the same day, the attackers equally set the Nnewi office of the Directorate of State Service (DSS) ablaze. Igbokwe said no life was lost, but that his property was burnt down.\n\nAlthough some groups have been suspected to be behind the evil act, the perpetrators of these dastardly acts have not been established. The state police command said that it was working round the clock to unearth the suspects.\n\nReacting to the ugly developments, former National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo (Youth Wing), Tony-Uche Ezekwelu, condemned the killings, saying that it was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that the rate and direction of the attack is going, you\u2019ll see that it is purely politically motivated. A lot people are trying to heap it on the IPOB/ESN, but if you look at the directions of the killings, some of the persons that were killed have no business with the IPOB\u201d, he said.\n\nGovernorship candidates of the various political parties in Anambra State have also condemned in strong terms, the killings and destruction of property by gunmen in the state.\n\nCandidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Valentine Ozigbo, Andy Uba (APC), Obiora Okonkwo of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, described the attacks and killings as barbaric and unacceptable.\n\nLike the former Ohanaeze youth leader, Senator Uba believed that the killings were politically motivated.\n\nThe Anambra situation may end up raising a can of worms as accusations and counter accusations fly about. While the APC in the state blame the APGA-led government for the killings; Governor Willie Obiano dropped the bombshell last Wednesday, when he accused some of his colleagues of sponsoring violence in his state.\n\nPolitical Adviser to the governor, Chief Ifeatu Obi-Okoye, who made the allegation gave that as the reason Obiano had again shunned the security meeting of Southeast governors and some leaders from the zone in Enugu on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the Ebubeagu security outfit which should ordinarily have assisted the security operatives in combating insecurity has not been floated in the state.\n\nBut, vigilante groups have been in operation for a long time in the state. Part of their job is to secure the communities and also assist the police and other security operatives.\n\nMeanwhile, as part of efforts to address the insecurity in the state, Obiano recently announced a N20 million bounty on the killers of Dr Akunyili.\n\nThe state police command has also said that serious efforts were being made to apprehend the gunmen terrorizing the state.\n\nPolice spokesperson in the state, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, told our reporter that police were working real hard to track down the attackers.\n\nEnugu: Residents feel the pangs too\n\nEnugu State has had its share of the killings by \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen with recent ones being the dastard murder of the Managing Director of Scientific Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), Prof Simon Ndubuisi and his Police escort in Enugu along Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway; retired Justice Stanley Nnaji along Garden Avenue Enugu, soldiers at Adani, policemen at checkpoints at Amodu Nkanu and Nachi in Oji River to mention but a few. Owner of Auto Ease Services, a popular car painting company, Ifeanyi Okeke, was also recently shot dead in Enugu.\n\nUnfortunately, things have become so confused in the Southeast zone that it is difficult to actually narrow the killings to a particular group, though fingers are being pointed at the Eastern Security Network (ESN), security agents and Fulani terrorists.\n\nWorse still, the Ebubeagu security outfit hurriedly announced by the Southeast governors to fight the Fulani killer herdsmen terrorizing the region has not taken off in Enugu. The state\u2019s preferred outfit, Forest Guards, seems not to have been designated to address security issues in the towns and urban centres of Enugu State.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has also shown interest in the Neighbourhood Watch, which he uses to guard against invasion of the rural farming communities.\n\nImo, Abia not yet free from gunmen\n\nImo State has been in the firm grip of violence allegedly perpetrated by unidentified gunmen since after the EndSARS protests in 2020.\n\nBut the situation worsened with the simultaneous attacks on both the police and the prisons headquarters in Owerri on the Easter Monday.\n\nEver since, the killings have continued unabated especially in Okporo, Umutanze, Omuma, Amaifeke, Eziachi, Orsu communities in the Orlu Senatorial District of the state.\n\nOn the evening of Thursday, September 16, 2021, Darlington Odume, a prominent lawyer in Orlu town was gunned down in a supermarket in Umudara Amaifeke community where he had gone to shop for his family by the ubiquitous gunmen who shot him at pointblank. Odume died on his way to the Imo State Teaching Hospital.\n\nAccording Duruoma Ike, one of the witnesses, the assailants of Odume who were in an SUV and dressed in black like the police special forces had apparently trailed him from his office in Orlu without his knowledge to the supermarket which was incidentally in his community.\n\nThey had waited outside for him to come and that immediately he came out, he was shot on his chest four times and they drove off from the scene at high speed before the people who were already perplexed could react.\n\nHe added: \u201cI am very sure that those who shot Odume are certainly from this state, but what I can\u2019t say for sure is if they are members of the IPOB/ESN. The ESN could not have been responsible because he was handling cases of some of those arrested by the police on the allegation that they were members of the IPOB in Orlu. Initially, when those armed men came down from their SUV, most people who were around the vicinity including myself had thought that they were police officers because they were all attired in black with black jeans because that is how the police dress these days. But it was not until they opened fire on him which sent those around scampering for safety that I knew that they were assassins.\u201d\n\nDuruoma Odimara, a security consultant, said that though he had not personally encountered the so-called \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen, that some of the video of their activities posted on the social media showed that the people are certainly from the Southeast or other states like Rivers or Delta, but are Igbo.\n\nHowever, he noted that the situation has degenerated because of the incompetence of the security agents especially the police whom he accused of mental laziness.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that the police as a result of their mental laziness and beer parlour policing are not able to tackle the situation. In this state before the advent of the ESN, we have been under siege of armed robbers and kidnappers in the entire Orlu zone, and I am sure it is these criminals who are now masquerading as \u2018unknown gunmen.\u2019 All those who have been arrested by the police or the army; I have not seen any Hausa man or Fulani man because they are easily recognizable. I am also sure that the IPOB/ESN are no longer operating in this state, so the police if their intelligence is still functioning should be able to know those who are responsible for what is happening,\u201d he opined.\n\nIn addressing the issue, the state government at the height of the gunmen attacks on police infrastructure had provided them with more operational vehicles, communication equipment and even more amoured tanks.\n\nHowever, in spite of Governor Hope Uzodimma signing into law the establishment of the Ebubeagu, with about 3,000 personnel reportedly trained at the Police College Oji River, Sunday Sun gathered that the security outfit was yet to be established in Imo.\n\nIn Abia State, apart from killings recorded when gunmen attacked some police stations, the killing of a businessman early this year at the Isuikwuato axis of the state and that of a student of Marist Comprehensive Academy, Uturu, Master Donald Edeh around Ihube Road, there had been no other reported killings in the state in recent times.\n\nThe late businessman was killed while travelling with his family, while the deceased student, Edeh, was shot dead as he was returning with his colleagues after visiting a Final Religious Profession of some Marist Brothers in Orlu, Imo State.\n\nPeople residing within Isuikwuato and Uturu, Abia State and Okigwe, Imo State axis, which have become black spots of violent crime of late told Sunday Sun, that they suspected Fulani herdsmen for the atrocities perpetrated in their areas.\n\nThey blamed the herders for the killing of the businessman and Edeh.\n\nHowever, in the case of the Isuikwuato incident, the natives said a local vigilante group working in consonance with security agents, were able to identify and neutralize the gang members.\n\nSunday Sun learnt that a butcher who hails from a neighbouring community, but doing business in Isuikwuato, served as informant to Fulani herdsmen in the area.\n\nIt was also gathered that the butcher who stayed in a strategic location in Isuikwuato, was the one passing information about the movement of people to the herders who stationed in a bush outside the community.\n\nWith the information provided by the butcher, his Fulani herdsmen accomplices, were able to track down their victims who they abduct for ransom or kill outrightly like in the case of the businessman.\n\nAfter the killing of the businessman, the vigilante in the area swung into action and with the backing of security agents, the gang members were apprehended and since then, there has been relative peace in the area.\n\nBut the area has remained a nightmare as the Uturu-Okigwe axis where the activities of the hoodlums has remained unabated.\n\nWith the killing of the student, Abia governor, Okezie Ikpeazu directed the state Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Janet Agbede to work in concert with her Imo State counterpart to fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime.\n\nHowever, more than one month after the incident and the corresponding directive, it was yet to be known if any headway has been made in that direction.\n\nA native of Uturu who gave his name as Egbe Ude alleged that the \u201cgovernment and security operatives cannot claim they do not know from where these abductions and killings going on in the area are coming from, but I don\u2019t know why they have not acted swiftly to arrest the situation\u201d.\n\nHe said that it will be practically impossible for the local vigilante to apprehend the perpetrators of the heinous crime in the area because of the sophistication of the arms they carry about and their modus operandi.\n\nSearch for solution\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor, recently described the violence in the area as a systematic destruction of the geo-political zone.\n\nThe socio-cultural group also drew the attention of the IPOB to the danger violence has posed in Igbo land and asked the group to facilitate an end to the carnage.\n\n\u201cToday, what we are seeing in Igbo land is not liberation, but Igbo destruction and devastation. It is a national tragedy for Igbo. The liberty and freedom of Ndigbo are threatened internally and externally. I call on IPOB leaders to reassert its authority and control of the organisation,\u201d Obiozor stated.\n\nFirst Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulke Amechi, has also appealed to those behind the alleged insecurity in the region and Anambra State in particular, to sheath their sword and allow peace to reign.\n\nIn his statement at his house in Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area, Anambra State, Chief Amechi, appealed to whoever might be responsible for the killings and destruction of property to please drop their weapons \u201cbecause peace is never won with the guns.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman lashed out at the Southeast governors, for what he called their inability to hold their mandates well, saying \u201cthey are not acting as true Igbo leaders, they are leaders, but they don\u2019t seem to know that, look at the Ebubeagu they formed, they cannot even finance it, they are not serious.\u201d\n\nHe urged the governors to buckle down and save their people from further annihilation by gunmen.\n\nAlthough the leadership of IPOB has maintained their innocence in the orgy of killings and violence in the zone, Chairman of South East Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, last Wednesday, alleged that criminals have hijacked the activities of IPOB.\n\nUmahi who spoke on a live television programme alleged that some persons living abroad had taken control of the Biafra agitation and continued to play on the emotions of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou see, at the beginning where we have IPOB saying they are agitating for the creation of Biafra for the reason of the marginalization of the zone. And then a lot of people keyed in, and it became that anybody that has a problem with the centre, the person becomes a supporter of IPOB, those in Diaspora that went for greener pastures that failed to get such become very bitter with the Nigeria government and so, the followers kept growing, and then the issue of herdsmen came up and there were a couple of killings in Southeast and the people were killed helplessly and they felt the governors were not protecting them.\n\n\u201cBut we did quite a lot to ensure that there is peace between our farmers and the herdsmen, but that was not the way some people that were aggrieved wanted us to go, but that was the way we should go. Then came up the IPOB/ESN, which is the militant aspect of the IPOB, and then they started to issue orders of threats like if you do this, if you do that and all sort of that. Along the line the whole exercise was hijacked, we no longer have kidnappers and armed robbers, every criminal now claims to be an IPOB member, and some politicians from what we learnt also capitalized on that and started importing killers from outside Southeast to advance their political interest by what we are seeing in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nUmahi said that his colleagues working with other Southeast leaders were bent on finding lasting solution to the grievances of the people of the zone especially the youth.\n\nHe lamented that restiveness had endured in the region because a lot of people had been brainwashed and misinformed into believing that some persons were fighting for them.\n\nA communique by the governors and leaders of the zone after their meeting in Enugu condemned the killings in the region and resolved to join forces with the country\u2019s security agencies to end the menace.\n\nThey also directed all the states to launch Ebubeagu by December 31, and give it the necessary legal backing. The meeting further condemned the frequent sit-at-home calls by non-state actors, particularly the IPOB, and vowed to do everything within the law to end such orders.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nIn the eight-point communique presented to newsmen, Umahi also said that \u201cthe meeting received the Committee report from Ohanaeze on various matters affecting the Southeast, especially on the issue of security and marginalization of the Southeast people, and resolved to study the reports from Ohanaeze Worldwide for immediate implementation, and engagement with the Federal Government for amicable settlement of all issues agitating the minds of our people, especially the youths.\u201d",
          "summary": "There have been killings in Onicha Igboeze in the last three months by gunmen and security agents.\nHowever, police in the state accused the pro-Biafra group, IPOB, of masterminding the killing while enforcing its sit-at-home order in the area.\nThe family source who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cThat day at about 6:00a.m our brother was attacked and killed alongside seven other persons.\nAs gunmen continue to spread sorrow in the Southeast, the people of the region are living in fear and uncertainty.\nOn the same day, three naval personnel on duty at Awkuzu, Oyi LGA were attacked and killed.",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nWell-endowed songstress, Chinenye Joy Nweke a.k.a Supernova, doesn\u2019t mince words. She speaks candidly and directly, especially when it comes to comparing herself with others.\n\nIn this interview, the versatile singer, actress and movie producer opens up on her career, insisting that she\u2019s better and more beautiful than all other Nigerian female artistes. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us briefly about yourself?\n\nMy name is Chinenye Joy Nweke popularly known as Supernova. I am 22 and first child from a family of eight. I\u2019m from Ebonyi State, but graduated from Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK) where I studied Business Administration. I won some beauty pageants at the time, including Queen of Anambra Heritage despite being a native of Ebonyi State.\n\nYou\u2019re fast becoming a household name and your Abuja show turning a talk of the town, this must have cost you a fortune; how are you coping with it?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve spent over N150 million since the establishment of Black Celebrity Empire, my music outfit. Aside this, I\u2019ve made some financial impact on over 10,000 youths across the 36 states of Nigeria. And they have contributed to my career as well. Music is not easy, it costs too much money, but God has been there for me, and I\u2019m happy the way my career is going.\n\nWhat influenced your stage name, Supernova?\n\nThe stage name, Supernova was influenced by my love for science. Supernova means \u2018when the star explodes it\u2019s the brightest to that of the sun\u2019, so I chose the name to illuminate the entertainment scene. Yes, I am Supernova. My journey into the music world started in 2019, and I have a few singles to my credit, including Badder Than You, Bounce, Key, Moon, Holyshit, and Hustle Go Pay, and my latest effort, Casanova.\n\nWhat inspired your song, Casanova?\n\nThe song, Casanova is from my experience back in 2018. I had this guy I was dating; he was a Casanova. One woman was not always okay for him. He was everywhere and always playing with my emotions. This song and my other songs tell a story as it concerns poverty, maltreatment, discrimination, domestic violence, gender humiliation, and corruption at all levels.\n\nWhich audience does your music look to capture?\n\nI want my music to be loved by all. Growing up, I always listened to Bob Marley because my dad always played his songs, though he\u2019s late now. So, I love his music because it tells stories, he feels the pain of the people, he knows what the masses are passing through. I got inspiration from there. This is what you can associate my music with, the reality and what people go through.\n\nAre you looking to work with other artistes?\n\nI really look forward to working with artistes in Nigeria and internationally. I look forward to working with the likes of 2Baba, Big Wiz and Davido.\n\nAs an artiste, what stands you out?\n\nConsidering my style of music, I would say I\u2019m bringing the future of music to Nigeria. I have different genres of sound, including my main Afrobeat, R&B and hip-hop. You will also hear trap music instrumentals all embedded in the modern style of music that I would be bringing, which is something unique and different. And there\u2019s a message in every of my songs.\n\nAre you saying you have what it takes to compete with other female artistes in the industry?\n\nI have what it takes to shine in the industry. I have the passion for music; I\u2019m also here for the money because I love money as an Igbo girl. I\u2019m confident, I have the beauty, and looking at sexiness, I would be bringing the full package especially how a 21st Century female artiste should look. Presently, I don\u2019t think there is any (Nigerian) female artiste that is as beautiful as I am or has a good song like I do, because my songs are not just about the beat, but also about good lyrics.\n\nHow have you been tackling challenges?\n\nThere are always challenges. Starting anything like music or even any business, the challenges are always there, but one shouldn\u2019t give up. Music is like a product and as such can be challenging trying to get people to listen to you and love what you do. But I\u2019m grateful for the crew I\u2019m working with. I almost gave up. But I had to tell myself \u2018if I stop doing music what else will I do? I didn\u2019t want to go into movies fully where I\u2019m more of a producer than actor. Although, doing movies makes me happy, but I\u2019m more excited doing music where I fully express myself. Music is the only thing that wakes me up in the middle of the night, and if it\u2019s not going well, I will start crying and feel depressed.\n\nTell us more about your Abuja show?\n\nMy concert is coming up on October 16, 2021 at the prestigious Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. Tagged: \u2018Supernova Live\u2019, the show will feature 2Face, Juliet Ibrahim, Edo Pikin and another notable one I don\u2019t want to reveal for now.\n\nHow would you advise up and coming artistes?\n\nDon\u2019t give up, as it is usually not smooth from the onset. When you\u2019re newly entering into the music space, you have to remove your mind from making money immediately. Just have the passion and let the passion first drive you. There are millions of fans out there that would subscribe to your music; just be you. Even when others around you say that your music is trash, gather courage to put that music out and you will not regret it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "2023: I\u2019ll only drop my presidential ambition if slot is zoned to Southeast \u2013 Dr Doyin Okupe",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nDr Doyin Okupe has been lying low in the political scene since the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2015 general elections. Though still undecided on which platform to align with, he has made a declaration of his intention to join the 2023 presidential race.\n\nThis is even as he urged the APC and PDP to concede their tickets to the Southeast, promising to drop his ambition in favour of the concession.\n\nHow would you react to the issue of power shift that is generating controversy between the North and the South?\n\nIf a Northern president has just concluded his Northern presidency, it is unjustifiable under any guise whatsoever for us to have another president from the North back-to-back for another eight years. The pronouncement of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum is astonishing. The language that was used to describe the pronouncement of the Southern governors is also highly unexpected. You don\u2019t talk about your colleagues like that. In this country, we must learn to respect one another. There is no part of the country that is subservient to the other. There is nobody in the North; no matter the position the person occupies, that is superior to any counterpart in the South or anywhere else. To say that the Southern governors are confused is very unfortunate. What we must recognise is that the country has changed a lot, but some people are still living in the past. The citizens of the North in the 60s, and 80s are different from citizens of this 21st Century. Ditto for those in the South. It will be a matter of regret later.\n\nThe tension generated by the pronouncement in the last couple of days is already heating up the polity. Is that not a worrisome signal?\n\nThe tension in the country is so great that if we do not apply wisdom, we may find ourselves in places we do not expect. I do not expect any group of leaders to gather in a place and make a declaration that can engulf the nation in crisis even under provocation. What has been done by the proclamation from Kaduna is to remove the political device we were hitherto operating on and replacing it with the North and South dichotomy. That is a dangerous development. From what I have seen, the APC and PDP are dead parties because their roles have been substituted with regional consideration. It doesn\u2019t make sense for me now to go to the NEC meeting of my party when irrevocable decisions have already been taken. So, what are we going to discuss at our NEC meeting? What are we going to decide at our convention? These decisions have been taken already. The South says there must be a Southern president. The North says under no circumstances would they agree to power rotation. These issues have gone beyond political parties. As far as I am concerned, political parties have become irrelevant. And unless something is done very quickly, we may be heading for the rocks.\n\nIt\u2019s like the governors are trying to play on the numerical strength of the North to spite their colleagues in the South. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nI am the first person to admit that the North can become president on their own without any support from the South. The constitution says that if at the first ballot, nobody meets the criteria of securing a clear majority or 25 per cent of the vote cast in 2/3 of the states, there will be a rerun. For the rerun, the constitution says the winner shall emerge by a simple majority. This implies that if a Northern candidate is presented and nobody voted for him in the South, he can win with simple majority of votes from the North. But he will be a Northern president and not a president of Nigeria, mark my words.\n\nIs that not where the country is headed now with the present scenario?\n\nIt is very obvious unless something is done very quickly. As an insider and as a stakeholder, I have had the privilege of seeing this country approaching the verge of collapse, but some people moved in quickly to avert the collapse. These people are still alive though they may have become old or temporarily incapacitated because of illness and all of that. But they still maintain their wisdom and political sagacity to put things together. I am talking about General Yakubu Gowon (rtd), former President Olusegun Obasanjo, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida (rtd), General Abdulsalami Abubakar, Emmanuel Iwuayanwu, John Nwodo, and former President Goodluck Jonathan. These people must within the next 72 hours come together quickly to intervene because the cleavage that has been unveiled cannot be closed unless something urgent is done. It will be difficult for Nigerians to trust one another for a long time now. But we can still build a bridge to close the fault line to allow for a peaceful co-existence. The North-South dichotomy has been announced in Kaduna and it is very unfortunate.\n\nFrom the current political permutation that is going on now, there may be a scenario where the APC will present a Southern candidate, while the PDP will field a Northern candidate. If that happens, the race would be the North versus South scenario. What do you think?\n\nThat will be a recipe for disaster politically. A scenario like that is a recipe for disaster. And nothing good will come out of it. But I want to say that that scenario is not likely because the acting chairman of the APC is a Northern and he is one of the governors who said that power would not shift to the South. How is he going to preside over a convention where they will declare a Southern candidate as president? We have boxed ourselves into a very dangerous corner. If APC chooses a Southern candidate, and PDP chooses a Northern candidate that is a disaster. If the two parties choose Northern candidates, that will be double jeopardy. The only solution is for the two parties to field Southern candidates. It has happened before when Olu Falae was chosen as APP candidate and Olusegun Obasanjo was chosen as PDP candidate. It is part of the sacrifices we must continually make to keep the country together as one. From day one, this country was built on sacrifice. When the South was ready for independence in 1958, the North said they were not ready. Instead of Nnamdi Azikwe and Obafemi Awolowo going ahead and declare the Republic of Southern Nigeria, they decided to wait for two years for the North to get its acts together and team up with them. And that is why we have Nigeria today. So, we have always lived by sacrifice. The North has never said because of their large population they will continue to have the president until now. The South has not said because they are the most educated they will occupy all the posts. It has never been done. You know that I have declared to run for the president of this country. I want to run for the presidency because of the rampaging poverty in the country. But as much as I want to be president, in truth and honesty, the next Nigerian president should come from the Southeast. If the whole Nigerians will be fair, I am willing to drop my presidential ambition. If there can a universal concession in the country to zone the president to the Southeast, l will drop my ambition and I will work for a Southeastern candidate. I am going to run unless the APC and PDP come to a consensus that Southeast should produce the next president. If that comes up, I will drop my ambition for the Southeast. But in the absence of that, I will still run whether or not the North says power is not going to shift. Let me be defeated at the poll.\n\nSome people see the declaration by the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum as a reaction to the issue of VAT, knowing full well that most of the states in that region depend largely on revenue coming from the federation account\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) What people are asking for is a nation at peace under an unjust law. The constitution is silent on VAT. It is not on the Exclusive List of the Federal Government. But we can have legislation that says because all fingers are not equal in this country, states that have higher revenue will devolve 10 or 15 per cent of their IGR to the Federal Government who will now share appropriately as they consider fit; after all, the oil that we share is owned 100 per cent by a section of the country. But we appropriate everything to the Federal Government and give them 13 per cent derivation. We must have justice in everything that we do. Any system that is built on injustice will not stand. Let us come together as a nation and agree on how we live like brothers.\n\nYou must have been reading the insinuation in the media that former President Goodluck Jonathan is being teased for another presidential contest. What is your take on this matter?\n\nFormer President Jonathan is a citizen of the country and he has the right to take whatever decision he wants to take. It is also his right to contest the presidential election for another term of four years if he wishes to do so. He is equally free to join any political party that he wishes. But if I were to advise, I will say that ex-President Jonathan has become a national icon. To step into the political arena now is going to injure that status.\n\nIsn\u2019t it just an ordinary myth for anybody to talk about one North now?\n\nThat is a fact. There is nothing like one North again. The Middle Belt is a different kettle of fish altogether. Kwara has a very strong presence of Yoruba people who do not owe allegiance to the North. The same thing with Kogi with a sizeable population of the Yoruba and other ethnic groups who may not necessarily kowtow to the North. Those that will follow the North may be a majority in Nassarawa, not too clearly a majority in Adamawa and Taraba states. Benue and Plateau are not under political obligation to align with the Northwest. When you talk about one North, you are talking about core North which is Northwest and a majority of the Northeast. Any other thing is a pipe dream, quote me.\n\nThat implies that your assumption that the North can on its own win an election is not realistic. Is it?\n\nThat is on the assumption that they will be able to keep their house in order and settle internal dissension. But if they are unable to do so, they are not numerically stronger.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",
          "summary": "The South says there must be a Southern president.\nBut he will be a Northern president and not a president of Nigeria, mark my words.\nHow is he going to preside over a convention where they will declare a Southern candidate as president?\nIf APC chooses a Southern candidate, and PDP chooses a Northern candidate that is a disaster.\nIt has happened before when Olu Falae was chosen as APP candidate and Olusegun Obasanjo was chosen as PDP candidate.",

The fact that they have been fighting in the operation was enough sacrifice but the military is a disciplined institution. The personnel know the rules and the regimentation and everybody in the service ought to be conscious of these all the time,\u201d he told journalists.\n\nLegal Adviser to the court, Squadron Leader Adeniji, said 28 officers were among those facing trials while the rest are soldiers. He said there were three courts; two General Court Martial Yobe and Borno and one Special Court Martial to treat very serious offences.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Fresh moves by Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to thwart the prosecution of suspects in the Malabu oil scam, including one of his predecessors, Mohammed Adoke have been uncovered.\n\nThe Malabu oil scandal involved the transfer of over $1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by a former Nigerian Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete.\n\nFrom accounts controlled by Etete, about half of the money ($520 million) went to accounts of companies controlled by Aliyu Abubakar, popularly known in Nigeria as the owner of AA oil.\n\nAnti-corruption investigators and activists suspect he fronted for top officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration as well of officials of Shell and ENI.\n\nThe transaction was authorised in 2011 by ex-president Jonathan through some of his cabinet ministers and the money was payment for OPL 245, one of Nigeria\u2019s richest oil blocks.\n\nThe oil resources of the OPL 245 license have remained undeveloped since the controversies began.\n\nOne of those being prosecuted by the Nigerian government is Adoke.\n\nHe is facing trial over the alleged role he played in the \u201cfraudulent\u201d transfer of ownership of an oil bloc, OPL 245, regarded as one of the biggest in Africa.\n\nOther defendants include Abubakar, Rasky Gbinigie, and four companies- Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited, and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that different moves to frustrate the prosecution were planned by Malami, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (former Special Duties Minister and senior partner of Malami), and Adoke in the Maitama private office of AGF. See Also Scandal How Nigerian Police Misrepresented Facts On Mohammed Adoke\u2019s Email Requesting To Transfer $1billion From Government Account\n\n\u201cThe media was yesterday overwhelmed with the news of Nigerian government\u2019s action against anti-corruption and human rights activist, Olanrewaju Suraju over the allegations of forgery by Muhammed Bello Adoke, ex-Attorney General of the Federation standing trial over complicity and bribery in the Malabu case.\n\n\u201cThe speed of submission of the case file from the IGP office, dated 20th September 2021 and purported filing of action before a court in Abuja is more than telling.

See Also Corruption Police IG Orders Fresh Investigation Into Alleged Forgery Against Ex-Justice Minister, Muhammed Adoke\n\n\u201cImagine, I was worried at the level of confidentiality exhibited during this meeting between the AGF and someone being prosecuted by his office on behalf of the government. Kabiru Tanimu was also spotted at Malami\u2019s office last Friday night.\n\n\u201cThis same Malami in the past attempted to thwart the government efforts at prosecuting the Malabu heist by writing a letter to Buhari, advising him to withdraw any action against suspects in the fraud,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nA memo dated 27th September 2017 to Buhari by Malami read, \u201cThere is nothing to show that the parties as constituted were at all times working together and having \u2018meeting of the mind\u2019 to wit to forge CAC documents and use some for the purpose of divesting the shares of the complainants and thereafter enter into a settlement agreement with FGN (Federal Government of Nigeria) and other parties to take delivery of the proceeds of sale OPL 245.\n\n\u201cThere is also nothing in the proof of evidence to support the charge of money laundering and it is therefore impossible for the prosecution to prove the elements which include illicit funds, transfer for such through various channels to re-introduce same again into the regular financial system as legitimate funds in financial institutions, etc. See Also News ANALYSIS: Revelations On Forged Electronic Mail Allegations Against Civic Society, HEDA By Embattled Ex-Attorney General, Adoke\n\n\u201cWithout the express proof of these elements, the count may not be sustained on the premise of the attached proof of evidence.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), then led by Ibrahim Magu countered Malami in a memo to the President and he was overruled.\n\n\u201cThis was at a time trial was already sustained in Milan and United Kingdom against principal actors in the controversial deal. What was most surprising was the appearance of an internal memo between the AGF and the President in court through Adoke\u2019s lawyer. That was sufficient to have led to the sacking of Malami but Buhari was too weak,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations of forgery by Adoke, the Inspector General ordinarily had allowed professional investigation by the Interpol and cybercrime unit, see the letters by the units into the matter until Malami saw an opportunity to deal with Suraju and HEDA, in addition to sabotaging the Malabu cases.\n\n\u201cBoth Suraju and HEDA have consistently campaigned against the corruption of Malami and his abuses of office. HEDA even called for Malami\u2019s removal from office. Malami intervened with the Police IGP for Adoke and investigations by the Interpol and DIG FCID were aborted for the notorious IGP monitoring unit to conclude the hatchet job.\n\n\u201cHe personally requested for a hurriedly concocted report to be submitted to his office, while Adoke interacted with some media executives to keep the stages in the media.\u201d\n\nAnother source in the Ministry of Justice expressed surprise at the speed they were directed to prepare and file the charges against Suraju.\n\n\u201cWe could not even see any evidence to sustain charges in the submitted file but the AGF wanted it prepared and filed soonest. That file has received the fastest treatment in the history of our ministry under Malami.\n\n\u201cWith these charges, it is certain the actions of Nigerian Government against JP Morgan in London, where the email under investigation, is threatened by Malami\u2019s action.

Kabiru Tanimu was also spotted at Malami\u2019s office last Friday night.\n\n\u201cThis same Malami in the past attempted to thwart the government efforts at prosecuting the Malabu heist by writing a letter to Buhari, advising him to withdraw any action against suspects in the fraud,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nA memo dated 27th September 2017 to Buhari by Malami read, \u201cThere is nothing to show that the parties as constituted were at all times working together and having \u2018meeting of the mind\u2019 to wit to forge CAC documents and use some for the purpose of divesting the shares of the complainants and thereafter enter into a settlement agreement with FGN (Federal Government of Nigeria) and other parties to take delivery of the proceeds of sale OPL 245.\n\n\u201cThere is also nothing in the proof of evidence to support the charge of money laundering and it is therefore impossible for the prosecution to prove the elements which include illicit funds, transfer for such through various channels to re-introduce same again into the regular financial system as legitimate funds in financial institutions, etc. See Also News ANALYSIS: Revelations On Forged Electronic Mail Allegations Against Civic Society, HEDA By Embattled Ex-Attorney General, Adoke\n\n\u201cWithout the express proof of these elements, the count may not be sustained on the premise of the attached proof of evidence.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), then led by Ibrahim Magu countered Malami in a memo to the President and he was overruled.\n\n\u201cThis was at a time trial was already sustained in Milan and United Kingdom against principal actors in the controversial deal. What was most surprising was the appearance of an internal memo between the AGF and the President in court through Adoke\u2019s lawyer. That was sufficient to have led to the sacking of Malami but Buhari was too weak,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations of forgery by Adoke, the Inspector General ordinarily had allowed professional investigation by the Interpol and cybercrime unit, see the letters by the units into the matter until Malami saw an opportunity to deal with Suraju and HEDA, in addition to sabotaging the Malabu cases.\n\n\u201cBoth Suraju and HEDA have consistently campaigned against the corruption of Malami and his abuses of office. HEDA even called for Malami\u2019s removal from office. Malami intervened with the Police IGP for Adoke and investigations by the Interpol and DIG FCID were aborted for the notorious IGP monitoring unit to conclude the hatchet job.\n\n\u201cHe personally requested for a hurriedly concocted report to be submitted to his office, while Adoke interacted with some media executives to keep the stages in the media.\u201d\n\nAnother source in the Ministry of Justice expressed surprise at the speed they were directed to prepare and file the charges against Suraju.\n\n\u201cWe could not even see any evidence to sustain charges in the submitted file but the AGF wanted it prepared and filed soonest. That file has received the fastest treatment in the history of our ministry under Malami.\n\n\u201cWith these charges, it is certain the actions of Nigerian Government against JP Morgan in London, where the email under investigation, is threatened by Malami\u2019s action. The Italian court which indicted Adoke of receiving bribes in the deal must also be monitoring developments,\u201d the source said.",
          "summary": "Fresh moves by Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to thwart the prosecution of suspects in the Malabu oil scam, including one of his predecessors, Mohammed Adoke have been uncovered.\nThe Malabu oil scandal involved the transfer of over $1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by a former Nigerian Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete.\nOther defendants include Abubakar, Rasky Gbinigie, and four companies- Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited, and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.\nMost Nigerians don\u2019t know there is a conspiracy that was arched in the Maitama private office of Malami between Malami, Turaki, and Adoke.\nThe Italian court which indicted Adoke of receiving bribes in the deal must also be monitoring developments,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "The Federal Ministry of Justice, under the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has exhausted its personnel costs in the 2021 budget and is currently bankrupt and unable to pay the salaries of its workers, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSome workers in the federal ministry told SaharaReporters that life had become increasingly difficult for them as they were unable to meet their financial obligations.\n\nThey wondered how Malami and other senior officials of the ministry would claim to have exhausted their personnel budgets before the end of a fiscal year, adding that the morale of the staff was now low.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Justice was unable to pay us last month\u2019s salary because the ministry has exhausted its budget according to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation. The Accountant-General had written to call the ministry\u2019s attention to it before, but out of Malami and others\u2019 negligence, they didn't take it serious, because they refused to act on it,\u201d a female worker told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHence, they couldn't pay our salaries.\u201d\n\nAnother worker in the ministry stated that if the situation was allowed to continue, their productivity would be affected.\n\nHe added that expectedly, many of them were down with rising debts.\n\n\u201cThe personnel cost of the ministry is exhausted. The top officials have lavished the money and have run down the ministry with wasteful spending. We have not got last month\u2019s salary,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of detailed investigations exposed how the Attorney-General of the Federation acquired several properties whose value ran into billions of naira since being appointed by Buhari.\n\nFor example, Malami has an underground hotel in Sokoto, three houses at Peace Estate, Abuja, a brand new state-of-the-art school in Kebbi, two houses for his sons worth N100million each, and a new hotel under construction in the Jabi area of Abuja. See Also Corruption Properties Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami, Corruptly Acquired While In Office\n\nHe also bought a house in 2020 worth N150 million in the Gwarimpa area of Abuja.\n\nPart of Malami\u2019s assets since becoming a minister is also a newly constructed school which is located at the back of NITEL in Gesse Phase 1, Birnin-Kebbi.\n\nA new house worth N600million on Ahmadu Bello Way, Nasarawa GRA, Kano, was acquired by Malami also after becoming a minister.\n\nMalami also built a N3billion multipurpose event centre in Kebbi state named Azbir Arena for his son in Kebbi.\n\nThis is apart from Rayhaan Hotel located on Zaria Road, opposite Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, which the AGF massively upgraded.\n\nEver since SaharaReporters published a series of detailed reports exposing these illicit acquisitions, the online news medium has been a target for the AGF\u2019s camp.\n\nDespite the open display of unexplained wealth by the AGF and members of his family in recent times, President Buhari, who rode to power in 2015 on the back of a promise to crush corruption, especially in the government circle, has yet to offer any statement on the development.\n\nObservers say Buhari\u2019s silence is an endorsement of the atrocities of one of his most trusted lieutenants, Malami.",

          "title": "Group Asks Buhari To Reduce N26Billion Presidency Budget For Medical Centre, Travels, Refreshments, Others",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto cut the N26 billion presidency budget\".\n\nThe group asked the President to reduce the presidency budget \"for the construction of the presidential wing at the state house medical centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, \u2018sitting allowance\u2019, and \u2018welfare package\u2019, and to use some of the savings to address the growing level of deficit, as well as improve public healthcare facilities across the country\u201d.\n\nSERAP Logo\n\nIt also urged the President to send to the National Assembly a fresh supplementary appropriation bill, which reflects the reduced proposed spending on the construction of the state house medical centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, and welfare package for its approval.\n\nIn the letter dated October 9, 2021, and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said, \u201cMany Nigerians will find it quite odd, unfair and unjust that the government is spending so much money on many of these items in the middle of a public borrowing crisis. The proposed spending could be better allocated to improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services.\n\n\u201cThe government would continue to borrow to fund the country\u2019s budget until there is a substantial cut to the cost of governance. The government should stop spending so much money on these items. Persistent borrowing is neither sustainable nor fair to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cYour government has a responsibility to ensure the interest of the well-being and prosperity of Nigeria and its citizens. The growing budget deficit and debt problems threaten Nigerians\u2019 access to essential public goods and services, and will hurt future generations if not urgently addressed.\"\n\nSERAP also urged the President to \"publish details of spending on construction and repairs of the presidential wing at the medical centre and office furniture and fittings since May 29, 2015\".\n\nIt further said, \u201cThe proposed spending figures highlight the lack of political will to cut the cost of governance, starting from the presidency. This spending is unsustainable and would take away critical funding to provide access to quality healthcare and education. This would leave the poorest and most vulnerable people without access to these essential public goods and services, and burden the next generation.\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, for the Office of the President, you recently proposed in the 2022 appropriation bill to spend N24,835,805,231 for the construction of the presidential wing at the state house medical centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the presidential wing will cost N21,974,763,310. N2,309,066,788 is proposed to be spent on general travel and transport while N301,138,860 will be spent on foodstuff and catering materials supplies. N250,836,273 is proposed to be spent on refreshments, meals, honorarium, sitting allowance, publicity and advertisements.\n\n\u201cFor the Office of the Vice-President, N1,136,717,757 is proposed for local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, purchase of office furniture and fittings, and other expenses. The details are: N778,261,411 is proposed to be spent on general travel and transport.\n\n\u201cN168,210,826 is proposed for office stationeries/computer, consumables, printing of documents, uniforms and other clothing, foodstuff and catering materials supplies. N2,350,626 is proposed for cooking gas and fuel cost.\n\n\u201cN99,795,229 is proposed to be spent on refreshments, meals, honorarium, sitting allowance, publicity and advertisements. N31,909,380 is proposed for computer software acquisition while N30,817,085 is proposed for the purchase of motor vehicles. N25,373,200 is proposed for the purchase of office furniture and fittings.\n\n\u201cWe would therefore be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our requests.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that the huge spending is neither necessary nor in the public interest, especially in the face of the country\u2019s dire economic position, the scant allocations to education and health, and the growing level of borrowing by your government to fund the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cSpending limited public funds on the construction of the presidential wing at the state house medical centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, honorarium and sitting allowance, and welfare packages at a time the government is borrowing to fund the budget would undermine your government\u2019s constitutional and fiduciary duties to ensure a responsible budget spending.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s fiscal situation must be changed - and changed quickly - through some combination of cuts in the areas highlighted above. Cutting waste and apparently unnecessary spending would go a long way in addressing the budget deficit and debt problems.\u201d",

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to be an average independent artiste, trying to work your way into the limelight or get proper attention? It could involve gate-crashing events looking to get noticed by a record label or putting in the effort to gain financial or mentorship opportunities \u2014 basically, trying to get the right contacts.\n\nFor most artistes, balancing creativity and business could be an uphill task. While the former could be what someone likes to do, the latter is not always within the control of an artiste. When it becomes challenging to get the right contacts to showcase one\u2019s talents, those that can afford it use the services of public relations agencies \u2014 whose rates can be pretty expensive \u2014 to get the exposure.\n\nNabsolute Media, a Nigerian media communications and marketing agency, is one of these companies. However, after running for a little above two years and handling rollout for famous clientele, the business has decided to make communications options open to independent artistes at an affordable rate with the launch of its platform, SpinHeard.\n\nWhy SpinHeard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpinHeard is the next frontier for us. We\u2019re trying to automate what we do for a lot of artists,\u201d former music journalist and founder of Nabsolute, Victor Okpala, tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a person who had to stick his neck out in the early days to get someone to bet on his capabilities, Okpala understands the importance of having a viable platform and the right contacts.\n\nStill, he believes that the times have become nicer such that the deal-breaker could just be time and chance. And the likelihood that exposure could come in easier ways has repeated itself as music becomes mainstream with the Internet.\n\nThis Harvard Business Review (HBR) piece makes a bold statement about the power of luck in any business. And Okpala strongly agrees with this, especially in music.\n\nA more recent case is how 17-year-old Salle\u2019s music broke the Internet and attracted huge attention, even from CNN, in less than a month. The young Nigerian\u2019s short performance was captured and posted by someone who\u2019d heard of her talents, and for her, that was all she needed.\n\nBut what are the odds if artistes leave it all to luck?\n\nWhile Nabsolute leverages storytelling, tech tools, and a network of influencers to amplify and market content within the creative industry, Okpala admits that these services might not be affordable for the average independent artist.\n\n\u201cWe know that an agency like Nabsolute is elite, which means there\u2019s a cost that comes with it if you want us to do a job for you.\u201d\n\nFor instance, running an entire campaign for four weeks could cost up to $1,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that is a fee that a lot of independent artistes cannot afford,\u201d Okpala explains, \u201cThis group makes up a large percentage of the industry. This means we have a big market that we can\u2019t help. We needed to extend our solution to more people.\u201d\n\nGiven what this process entails, the burden would be massive on the agency and might not be economical for someone with a lean budget. Hence, a need to automate all these processes on a platform.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a platform that will help independent artistes to break the barrier to music curators \u2014 journalists, OAPs, influencers, DJs \u2014 across all levels.\u201d After all, for him, \u201cevery song deserves a fair chance of being heard.\u201d\n\nHow SpinHeard works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking coverage across different platforms can be a monumental task. Even though the two-year-old business has built a name for itself and has a ready network of \u2018doers\u2019 that can be onboarded, I expressed my worries about the risk of these employees getting a heavier workload for less pay.\n\nAccording to Okpala, SpinHeard comes with incentives for these curators, especially to simplify their jobs. The web app will include tools that will organise and automatically prioritise requests based on release dates, deadlines, genre, regions, and other sorting attributes.\n\nA SpinHeard account can be owned by an artist, a manager, or a curator.\n\nThink of Upwork but for music creators and curators. A platform where artistes can pitch directly to people to get their content across to listeners. What is more significant than an assurance that people will hear them?\n\nThe platform also contains some starter kits that could help artists present their pitches in acceptable formats. This includes press release guides, pitch templates, and press kit templates.\n\nGiven SpinHeard\u2019s value offering, Okpala says the attached costs will be hugely subsidised compared to the standard PR cost. However, since the product is still in its beta phase, the charge is yet to be defined.\n\nBut Okpala makes an interesting case for getting your craft under the radar of an influencer or an OAP with $1, without having to worry about rejection, as long as the quality of the work is good. If the pitch is ignored, there is also a chance to get a refund.\n\nAsides from that, there is an option to pitch for free, with the decision to feature left to the curator\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor starters, SpinHeard will help independent artistes upload their content to the popular video-sharing app, Triller and get promoted for free, of course, after content vetting.\n\nOkpala talks about how this leverages an existing partnership between the social networking platform and Nabsolute. This would expose these independent artistes to the perks the company already offers clients it runs comms for \u2014 in terms of push notifications, banner support, and other home page features.\n\nOkpala confirms that curators will be onboarded later this month; this will arrive along with payment features.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economics of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s in it for Nabsolute.\n\nLike every new venture, profit isn\u2019t the main goal for now. Okpala believes that starting Nabsolute is risk enough, so the initial focus is on onboarding. Sometimes, the reward might have to come from testimonials telling of the impact on the independent artiste who might have gone unheard without a platform like SpinHeard.\n\nStill, as a business, there\u2019s a plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pad the agency service charge into what users pay to the curators through a percentage share. The model is going to be the typical split-share percentage.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is yet to be decided. The company is still in talks with the curator community, and Okpala can\u2019t confirm if these rates and percentage commission would vary from one curator to another.\n\nWhile his expectations aren\u2019t lofty, Okpala speaks of this product as a risk worth taking since it is the first in the industry, and the company would be willing to experience both the first-mover advantage alongside its disadvantages.\n\nWith an initial focus on Nigeria, the platform would ultimately be open to artists across the globe.\n\nOkpala and his love for music and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a music head,\u201d Okpala recalls.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story, so I probe further. After all, loving music doesn\u2019t always translate to being passionate about telling the story behind a song.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with the way music was being released. I felt like there was no storytelling interwoven in the rollout processes, and people could do better. Rollout felt like an afterthought compared to what happens in the US and other countries,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut he could not act on this until he founded Nabsolute, a story to be told later. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about what he did before then.\n\nOkpala opens up about a phenomenal change that a Kanye West song gave him in 2016 during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cThere was a part in the song, titled \u2018Waves\u2019, that felt like somebody was gasping for air,\u201d he pauses to imitate a beat, \u201cand that particular part of the song felt like it was me trying to find expression for something inside me that there were no words for.\u201d\n\nAnd the song helped him break out of what he would later get to know was depression.\n\nBefore officially becoming a journalist with Lagos-based online news and entertainment company, thenet.ng in September 2017, Okpala reviewed songs on his YouTube channel. He often criticised people\u2019s works, holding strong opinions, which he says have become more objective.\n\n\u201cI have always done my thing on YouTube. Documenting music, doing album breakdowns and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut his issue with the lack of storytelling in music rollout lingered in his mind.\n\nWhile working as a reporter, he felt something was missing, and the void needed to be filled. Okpala decided he had to be more active than just writing about music. So, he took a bold step; at that point, he had made quite a name for himself on the entertainment reporting scene.\n\nFor his first shot, he handled a project by Seyi Shay called Electric Package. He happened to be at the album listening event, where he approached her former manager, Kamal Ajiboye, offering to help them do better. He weaved a story around the EP\u2019s release and rolled it out with a mini-documentary that formed the backstory.\n\nThe success of the project gave him the clarity he had always looked for.\n\n\u201cThat was how I knew that what I was going to do next was to run a communications agency.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, he resigned and founded Nabsolute in July. Nabsolute is coined from the phrase, \u2018Not a Basic Solution\u2019, which he lived by while conceptualising what else to do. So far, the company has acquired notable clients like Runtown, Ycee, Reekado Banks, Skales, Darey Art Alade, K1 De Ultimate, among others.\n\nDespite the success recorded with Nabsolute, Okpala doesn\u2019t expect SpinHeard to be a walk in the park. And, in figuring out how to get things done, he and his team will make peace with the outcome.\n\nSo, fingers crossed. What do you think about this product?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder. (L-R) Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat. Source: Supplied\n\nMoroccan B2B eCommerce startup, Chari, has announced the close of a $5 million seed at a $70 million valuation to expand into more African countries.\n\nThe seed funding saw investments from Rocket Internet, Plug and Play, Y Combinator, and Orange Ventures, among others.\n\nWhat does Chari do? The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now. We\u2019ve seen massive funding and acquisitions like MaxAB\u2019s $40 million funding and its purchase of WaystoCap\n\nChari plans to expand into Francophone Africa and offer more financial services. However, the popularity of the sector could mean stiffer competitors for the startup.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nMonument to \u2018Mothers of Gynecology\u2019 unveiled in Montgomery.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt was the first few days of December, 2015 and the weather was still too chilly with the early signs of Harmattan.\n\nI got an SMS from a number saying I had been admitted to study Film at the National Film Institute, Jos.\n\nIt was such an exhilarating experience. Finally, I was going to make something of my passion for storytelling. Over the next few weeks, I accepted the admission, paid my school fees and commenced registration.\n\nIn the course of my study, a number of my school\u2019s staff often advised us \u2013 especially those of us who were offered admission by the school \u2013 to go and print out our original JAMB admission letter, also known as \u201cregularization\u201d if we want to go for the mandatory one year National Youth Service. But, when you\u2019re a freshman studying a four year course, graduation seems to be so far away.\n\nAnd so many of us didn\u2019t do it at the time. This has come to bite us literally and figuratively.\n\nToday, I was supposed to have been mobilized for the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corp, NYSC, but that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nMost of my classmates whom I graduated with have all gone and are serving right now as I speak: some in Batch B Stream 1 and others in Batch B Stream 2.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I gone is the question I and those close to me, are asking.\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s because I\u2019m yet to have my original JAMB admission letter, but, deep down, there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\n\nIs the regularisation real or hoax? If you go to any JAMB office nationwide, they will tell you that they have stopped regularization. But the same JAMB collects the sum of five thousand (N5,000) naira from students for this service.\n\nI first got to know about this through an article on The Nation Newspaper, The University of Jos vs. JAMB, where a JAMB spokesperson referred students with issues of regularization to go back to their school and resolve the issue.\n\nIn his words, \u201cJAMB stopped doing Regularization since 2017\u201d.\n\nI got admission to study film at the National Film Institute, Jos in 2015.\n\nNow, this admission was given by the Institute and I was supposed to go and \u201cregularize\u201d the admission with JAMB.\n\nBeing a newbie, I went several times to JAMB office and several cyber cafe\u2019s around but, I didn\u2019t understand what I was supposed to do.\n\nSeverally, I tried to check my admission status but it wouldn\u2019t go through. It was until I graduated that I understood what I was supposed to do and by this time it came with a warning that unless I did it, I wouldn\u2019t be going for service.\n\nI started doing the Regularization by March 2020 but, before I could pay, Nigeria went on lockdown and with the lockdown, JAMB payment portal was closed.\n\nIt was not until late October 2020 that it was opened and I succeeded in regularizing on November 2nd, 2020.\n\nFrom November 2nd, 2020 up till now, I still haven\u2019t received my original JAMB admission letter.\n\nWhen I asked what was the issue, my school, The National Film Institute, said that it was because JAMB has refused to send the PIN with which the University of Jos (which we are affiliated to) will use in printing it.\n\nBut what is the struggle for printing admission letter really all about? Before 2016, Universities nationwide offer provisional admission to Students\u2019.\n\nIn 2016, JAMB began offering admission to Students and with this every avenue some Universities used to make money like offering admission to some students in exchange for huge sums of money became a thing of the past.\n\nMost University authorities didn\u2019t like this and in 2021, they convinced JAMB to focus on just conducting the exams and leave the admission to them.\n\nThe University of Jos is one of the beneficiaries of this. With access granted to the University of Jos to print the admission letter, I thought my days of sorrow were over.\n\nI have called Paulina Yache, the Institute\u2019s contact person in charge of Regularization severally but, she too ran out of excuses and referred me to a Mr. Bitrus Gofup, in charge of regularization at the University of Jos.\n\nMr. Bitrus Gofup has been a torn in my flesh and in the flesh of other Students with the same issue. On the surface, Mr. Bitrus Gofup, a middle-aged junior staff at the Exams Office of the University appears as a genial and considerate father-figure who is out there to help students but deep down he is as corrupt as they come.\n\nI called him severally and he continued to assure me that my original JAMB admission letter has been sent to JAMB and that very soon it will be out, only for me to go to his office on Thursday October 6th, 2022 to discover that my name was not on the list of students that will be mobilized for service during the Batch C registration. In fact, there was no evidence to suggest that he has worked on my file, nor minuted on it.\n\nThis was after receiving assurances from him that he has sent our names to JAMB and that we should be patient that we will soon have our original JAMB admission letters.\n\nIf he\u2019s lying in order to get us very desperate to bribe him, it wouldn\u2019t be far from the truth. One of our classmates and friend who has the same regularisation problem told me that her friend gave Mr Bitrus Gofup the sum of N10,000 to fast track the process for him. Another classmate of mine, said she gave him the sum of N5000, but up till now both of these students are yet to have their original JAMB admission letters, or gone for service.\n\nWe are tired of all this. I have spoken to several Professors on this matter. I have also spoken to the Rector of my school. I have written to the Acting Vice Chancellor of the University of Jos, Professor Ejikeme, but, have gotten no reply.\n\nRight now, we are at a loss how to move forward. We just want to have this sorted out so that we know if we should go get a job or just run abroad.\n\n________________\n\nOgochukwu Umeadi, writer-designer wrote from Jos.\n\n...",

          "title": "Inside Nigeria\u2019s Debt Crisis: How foreign loan under Buhari triples past govts\u2019 combined figure",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s public debt has risen the most under the Buhari administration when compared to previous governments since 1999, and foreign debt has grown three times more than the combined figure recorded by the past three administrations, a PREMIUM TIMES analysis of the government\u2019s domestic and foreign debts has shown.\n\nWhile the Obasanjo government met $28 billion as foreign debt in 1999, it left $2.11 billion in 2007 after successfully securing a write-off by the London and Paris clubs of foreign creditors.\n\nThe Yar\u2019adua/Jonathan government added $1.39 billion to what they met, and the Jonathan government incurred additional $3.8 billion, taking the country\u2019s total foreign debt to $7.3 billion when that administration came to an end in 2015.\n\nNigeria\u2019s external loan reached $28.57 billion by December 2020, meaning an extra $21.27 billion had been accumulated under the Buhari administration \u2014 three times the combined amount by past governments since 1999.\n\nFor domestic debt, considered relatively less harmful to the value of Naira than foreign debt, the figure rose from N795 billion in 1999 when the Obasanjo government came to power, to N8.8 trillion in 2015 when the Buhari administration assumed office. By December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt stood at N16.02 trillion \u2014 twice as much the combined amount taken by the past three governments.\n\nThe domestic and foreign debt figures are higher now as the government has borrowed more in 2021.\n\n\u201dMore than Three-Quarter\u201d\n\nThe figures contradict a claim by the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Solomon Adeola, that \u201cthree-quarter\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s total debt profile estimated at N33 trillion naira was incurred by past administrations dating back to the military era.\n\nSpeaking at a Senate hearing on September 22, Mr Adeola in a response to a request by the Senate president, Ahmad Lawan, to clarify concerns over the nation\u2019s piling debt, said, \u201cThe borrowing you are saying is accumulated borrowing. It is not a borrowing of this administration alone, it is a borrowing that stems from the days of the military to the days when the Democratic dispensation started.\n\n\u201cIt is an accumulated loan, it is not a loan that says that it is the current administration of President Buhari that has borrowed.\n\n\u201cIt is a loan that has been borrowed by the previous administration \u2013 the Obasanjo, the Jonathan, the Yar\u2019Adua of this world.\n\n\u201c[And] since the business of government is a continuum, the president of the day has no choice but to continue to pay back all these loans that have been borrowed by the previous administrations.\n\n\u201cMore than three-quarter of these loans you\u2019re seeing were borrowed from the previous administrations, and we are paying back \u2013 we are doing what is supposed to be done, the way it is supposed to be done.\n\n\u201cSo, when my colleague said that for every sixty-seven naira of any loan that was borrowed, we are using to pay, he should know that more than sixty naira of it are loans borrowed by previous administration. And that is where we are.\u201d\n\nGovernment figures obtained and analysed by PREMIUM TIMES do not support Mr Adeola\u2019s \u201cthree-quarter\u201d claim. While previous administrations borrowed as shown above, it is the present government that has taken the bulk of the domestic and foreign loans.\n\nDebt Forgiveness\n\nIn 2006, Nigeria became the first African country to settle its public debt under a scheme devised to help the world\u2019s poorest and indebted states. The country under former President Olusegun Obasanjo paid off $18 billion to secure forgiveness of the balance of its nearly $30 billion debts to the London and Paris clubs of foreign creditors.\n\nBut 15 years later in 2021, Nigeria\u2019s public debt is high again, putting pressure on the government\u2019s revenue and performance.\n\nA report by the World Bank placed Nigeria among the top 10 countries with the highest debt risk exposure. Nigeria is fifth with $11.7 billion debt exposure, behind India ($22 billion), Bangladesh ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($16.4 billion), and Vietnam ($14.1 billion).\n\nIn recent periods, there has been a furore over Nigeria\u2019s borrowing plans and debt profile. The Debt Management Office (DMO) said as of March 31, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt stood at N33.1 trillion ($87.24 billion) \u2014 accumulated between 1999 and 2021.\n\nThe overall public debt, DMO said, is the total public debt stock which includes the external and domestic debts of the federal and state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s share of the public debt jumped from N3.55 trillion in 1999 to N26.91 trillion in March 2021. This means the nation\u2019s debt stock has risen by over 650 per cent in 21 years.\n\nContributions By Past Governments\n\nRecords show that Nigeria\u2019s external debt stood at $28.04 billion in 1999 when Mr Obasanjo came into office. Following the debt forgiveness, it was $2.11 billion at the time Mr Obasanjo left office in 2007.\n\nHowever, while external debts declined under Mr Obasanjo, domestic debts increased from N795 billion to N2.17 trillion between 1999 to 2007.\n\nThe country\u2019s currency exchange rate was between N98.02 and N116.8 to a dollar within the period, according to the central bank.\n\nAt the beginning of the Umaru Yar\u2019Adua/Goodluck Jonathan administration, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt stood at N2.17 trillion but jumped to N5. 62 trillion at the end of their administration in 2011. External debt also moved from $2.11 billion to $3.5 billion within the period under review.\n\nIn effect, the debt stock moved from N2.42 trillion to N6.17 trillion in four years, representing an average of N930 billion borrowing per year. The nation\u2019s exchange rate also fell from N116.8/$1 to N156.7/$1 during the period, according to CBN.\n\nIt is important to note that Mr Jonathan completed the tenure from May 2010 to May 2011 after the death of Mr Yar\u2019Adua. The 12 month period saw an increase in the federal government\u2019s debt from N4.94 trillion to N6.17 trillion.\n\nBy May 2011 when Mr Jonathan was elected to serve a fresh term in office, Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt was $3.5 billion but went up to $7.35 billion when he left in 2015.\n\nIn the same vein, the country\u2019s domestic debt climbed from N5.62 trillion to N8.8 billion.\n\nNigeria\u2019s combined debt figure under Mr Jonathan administration went from N6.17 trillion in 2011 to N9.8 trillion in 2015. This represents a N3.63 trillion increase or an average of N900 billion loan in a year.\n\nThe country\u2019s official exchange rate also stood at N197/$1 during the period under review.\n\nIncumbent President Muhammadu Buhari inherited an N8.8 trillion federal government\u2019s domestic debt in 2015. However, the figure rose to N16.02 trillion as of December 2020.\n\nLikewise, the nation\u2019s exchange rate fell from N197 to a dollar in 2015 to N381 at the end of December 2020.\n\nUp from $7.35 billion in 2015, Nigeria\u2019s external borrowings stood at $28.57 billion as of December 2020. This means that the administration incurred $21.27 billion in foreign loans.\n\nBut putting together external and domestic borrowing, Mr Buhari had borrowed N17.06 trillion as of March 2021, using the N381 exchange rate. This represents an average of N2.83 trillion per year since 2015.\n\nLikewise, the nation\u2019s exchange rate moved from N197 to a dollar in 2015 to N381 at the end of December 2020.\n\nDebt Service Taking Huge Toll On Yearly Budget\n\nDebt service obligations gulped 97 per cent of the Nigerian government\u2019s total revenue in 2020, according to Budgit, a civic-tech non-profit organisation. Of the N3.42 trillion generated as revenue, Nigeria spent N3.34 trillion in debt servicing, Budgit said in a July report.\n\nAlso, N3.3 trillion was set aside for debt servicing in the assented 2021 budget, about a quarter (24.3 per cent) of the entire N13.6 trillion total expenditure.\n\nThis trend has been in place since 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the country spent almost a quarter (about 24 per cent) of its budget to service debts. Of the N6.6 trillion budgeted for 2016, the government earmarked N1.5 trillion for debt financing.\n\nThe sum of N1.6 trillion was proposed for servicing debts out of the total (N7.3 trillion) budgeted for 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the figure rose as N2.2 trillion or 24.17 per cent was pegged for debt servicing in the N9.1 trillion budget.\n\nIn 2019, the government proposed to spend 24 per cent (N2.14 trillion) of the N8.9 trillion expenditure on debt service.\n\nIn mid-September, Mr Buhari sought the approval of the Senate to borrow $4 billion (4,054,476,863) and \u20ac710 million loan from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe president said the loan request is an addendum to the 2018-2020 borrowing plan and that the new borrowing is to meet \u201cemerging needs\u201d for some \u201ccritical projects.\u201d\n\nIn July, the National Assembly had approved Mr Buhari\u2019s request to borrow $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\n\u201cBad Times Ahead\u201d\n\nEconomic analyst, Tope Fasua, said Nigeria\u2019s loan is already unsustainable because it is taking 95 to 97 per cent of revenue generated. \u201cThat ratio is not sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nThe huge amount the Nigerian government is borrowing mostly is \u201cto cater for a lot of failures and they just borrow to keep some activities going,\u201d the economist said. \u201cHow the loans are going to be paid is not in question for them and that\u2019s very unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe loan is unsustainable from the perspective of revenue, from the perspective of corruption and value for money and from the perspective of project implementation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly 30 per cent value for money is what we get especially on these loans, some of what we are taking are for very frivolous issues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, we should take loans only for projects that have the ability to pay themselves back. If a project is not generating cash flow, it shouldn\u2019t be taken.\n\n\u201cIf we are taking loans for local roads and schools, who is going to pay? These are projects that should be funded from internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the currency challenges to Nigeria\u2019s debt portfolio.\n\n\u201cWe have a challenge with the naira presently, and one of the key things that throws your currency off is debt unsustainability.\n\n\u201cAnd mind you, most of the loans we are taking in recent times have not fallen due for payment, what we are doing is only paying the interest. Many of them have moratoriums on interest payments.\n\n\u201cThese guys have actually booked for us a bad time and a lot of trouble upfront,\u201d he said.\n\nSamuel Bamidele, Head of Research and Intelligence at Phillips Consulting Limited said although Nigeria\u2019s debt remained within the IMF recommended range with respect to GDP, the country faces a challenge when its debt stock is compared to its revenue. He also worried about how the government was using the borrowed funds.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt stock at 33% of GDP is sustainable at that level, but the issue is more around servicing the debt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen your debt stock is above 40 per cent, according to the IMF Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF), it means that it\u2019s no longer sustainable,\u201d Mr Bamidele said.\n\n\u201cSo you can say that Nigeria\u2019s debt profile is sustainable at the current level but the problem is the revenue. Because when your revenue is low you will need more money in terms of borrowing to finance both capital and recurrent projects.\n\n\u201cAt a point in time in 2020, our debt service was 99 per cent. What this means is that for every N1 earned, we are using 99 kobo to service debt.\n\n\u201cConversation around our debt should be more geared towards how we are channeling the debt we are borrowing in terms of efficiency and proper allocation. The danger here is we are not sufficiently channeling what we are borrowing on productive capacity and infrastructure, instead we borrow to finance more of recurrent spending.\u201d",
          "summary": "By December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt stood at N16.02 trillion \u2014 twice as much the combined amount taken by the past three governments.\nNigeria is fifth with $11.7 billion debt exposure, behind India ($22 billion), Bangladesh ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($16.4 billion), and Vietnam ($14.1 billion).\nAt the beginning of the Umaru Yar\u2019Adua/Goodluck Jonathan administration, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt stood at N2.17 trillion but jumped to N5.\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt stock at 33% of GDP is sustainable at that level, but the issue is more around servicing the debt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo you can say that Nigeria\u2019s debt profile is sustainable at the current level but the problem is the revenue.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has proposed N5.231,101,743 for general rehabilitation and repair of fixed assets in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, Abuja in the 2022 Appropriation Bill submitted to a joint session of the National Assembly last week.\n\nA study of the proposal by Daily Trust showed that rehabilitation/repair of office buildings will gulp N5,176,045,297, while residential building will take N55,056,446 out of the N150,590,609,934 expected to be spent by the Presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 proposal, N4,854,381,299 was set aside for annual routine maintenance of mechanical/electrical installations in the Villa, Daily Trust reported.\n\nThe ongoing construction of the presidential wing in the State House Medical Centre is expected to gulp N21,974,763,310.\n\nAccording to the estimate, the ongoing phased replacement of vehicles and spares will cost N1.6bn compared to the N436m set aside for a similar purpose in the 2021 proposal.\n\nAbout N180,089,000 is provided for purchase of tyres for bulletproof vehicles, plain cars, CCU vehicles, platform trucks, jeeps, ambulances and other utility and operational vehicles.\n\nLast year, N116,194,297 was set aside for a similar purpose.\n\nThe replacement of Villa telecommunication infrastructure will take N400,000,000.\n\nThe 2022 budget proposal also shows that President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will spend N457,801,260 on foodstuff and catering materials as N301,138,860 and N156,662,400 has been set aside for the offices of president and the vice president.\n\nCommunications ministry to spend N939m on travels, salaries\n\nAbout N938million will be spent on salaries and travel allowances of civil servants working in the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy in 2022, the estimates of the budget have shown.\n\nThis is from the N160.593billion total allocation to the ministry. Out of N160.5bn, N22.7bn was allotted to personnel cost, while overhead got N679.7m. About N137.2 will be expended on capital projects across the country.\n\nHowever, the ministry\u2019s headquarters got N85.2bn, out of which N938.179.428m will be spent on salaries and travel allowances of staff.\n\nStaff salaries will gulp N898.1m while N40.1m will be spent on local and international travels by officials of the ministry.\n\nLocal travel and training got N17.8m, others got N17.5m, while international travels got N4.7m.\n\nAbuja second runway gets additional N20bn\n\nThe federal government is to expend additional N20bn on the ongoing second runway of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja in 2022.\n\nThe second runway, which is estimated to gulp N67bn, has been largely stalled due to poor funding.\n\nIt would be recalled that in the 2017 budget, N10bn was voted for the project, N8bn in 2018, N13bn in 2019 and N14bn in 2021.\n\nThe federal government also set aside N1.6bn to refund Bayelsa and Kebbi governments for the construction of airports at their respective states.\n\nAlso contained in the budget of the Ministry of Finance is N1bn for the installation of Category Three (CAT3) Instrument Landing System (ILS) and airfield lighting in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Katsina, Kano and other airports.\n\nEducation gets below UNESCO target\n\nThe federal government has voted N1.290tn for the education sector in the 2022 appropriation bill against the allotted N742bn in the 2021 budgetary allocation.\n\nThe N1.290tn for education is 7.9 per cent of the N16.3tn and the third highest allocation for the year 2022, and yet, failed to meet the minimum of 15 to 20 per cent for developing countries\u2019 as suggested by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).\n\nHealth gets increased budgeting\n\nThe allocation to health for next year at N711.285b is about 30 per cent higher than N549.82b in the current year.\n\nThe emphasis on this sector is hardly surprising after the devastation the sector experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nPresident Buhari said some of the activities that would be undertaken in this sector in 2022 included \u201ccritical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading primary health care centres across the six geopolitical zones.\u201d",

          "text": "Death penalty is evil and should be abrogated, an Abuja-based lawyer and human rights activist, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, has said.\n\nHe said such punitive action has not yielded the desired result and should be abrogated in the country even as he decried the plight of the poor to access to justice.\n\nRecall that Ajulo recently offered pro bono service which led to the rescue a teenager, Adeolu Bamiteko, from the hangman\u2019s noose in Ekiti State.\n\nDescribing the feat as his landmark achievement in his career as a lawyer, he expressed happiness for saving the life of the teenager, stressing empirical evidence has shown that the death penalty is no longer required in Nigeria.\n\nWhile sympathising with the boy\u2019s harrowing experience while in cell, Ajulo noted: \u201cThis is the first time in my professional life that a minor will be let off the hook just by the grace of God through legal intervention. It is quite very rare.\n\n\u201cI remember one day I was talking to him and you know what this boy told me: he said anytime his name is called, it is either for food or he will not come back, because nobody calls condemned criminals. And when you call condemned criminals, two things happen. The possibility of returning back after answering that call is 50-50.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI see it as a civic duty to humanity.

And so, if we keep on talking about the girl child all the time and forget that the girl child is going to end up with the boy child at home as husband and wife, and then they will have children and then the circle starts all over again. The point here is that it has to be balanced,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nShe added that by the nature and perception of the boy child as being strong and resilient, the society tends to pay little or no attention to issues affecting male children.\n\n\u201cEven as we plan to commemorate the International Day of the Girl Child on October 11, we are of the strong view that the interests, welfare and well-being of the boy child too should be factored into the scheme of affairs.\n\n\u201cThus, our Boy Child Initiative is aimed at focusing the searchlights on the challenges that boys are silently contending with, and proffer workable as well as actionable solutions. This initiative is simply about inclusion and ensuring that no member or strata of the society is left behind,\u201d the First Lady said.\n\nShe also made a case for the full recognition of May 16 which is the International Boys Day by the United Nations.\n\n\u201cI know there are quite a number of people like me out there all over the world that have been pushing for the boy child initiative. It has not been recognized hundred percent by the United Nations, but I know with time when a lot of us push this initiative a little bit more, it will be recognized,\u201d she said.\n\nGiving further details on the initiative, Sanwo-Olu said participants from ages 9 and 17 who have already been selected from the five administrative divisions of the state namely Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos Island and Epe would go through a one-week residential training, while parents from various groups and associations would also be lectured on how to handle the training of boy child.\n\nShe said some of the topics which would be facilitated by subject-matter experts include Security and You, Mental Health, Media Literacy and Responsible Use of Social Media, Counseling, Parenting, Family Values, Civic Responsibility, Entrepreneurship, Career Path Finding, Self-Esteem, Personal Hygiene and Etiquette, among others.\n\nOther activities are Table Tennis Competition, Boy Bands and visits to historical sites and strategic organizations.\n\nAs part of the initiative, an awareness walk was held from Ikeja City Mall to Lagos House, Alausa Ikeja, with the First Lady, various NGOs and students selected from both the formal and informal sectors participating and displaying placards of various inscriptions such as \u201cI stand with the boy child; stop neglecting the boy child; boys are important too,\u201d among others.\n\nThe launch was attended by various stakeholders such as Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), Association of Primary School Teachers, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Nasrullah-Fathih Society of Nigeria (NASFAT) Women Wing, Nigeria Institute of Building, Nigerian Society of Engineers, Nigerian Psychological Association, Nigeria Union of Journalists, Homes administered by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development and students from educational districts of the Ministry of Education.\n\nOther groups in attendance are Iyaniwura Children Care Foundation, Purkiche Girl Child Foundation, Street Child Care & Welfare Initiative, Chosen Child Orphanage and Care Centre, Compassionate Orphanage, Child Protection Network and others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "David Oyedepo, the founder and general overseer of Living Faith Church Worldwide, is the latest Nigerian mega-preacher discovered to have set up a family offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, following Chris Oyakhilome of Christ Embassy and the late Temitope Joshua, the founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations.\n\nMr Oyedepo\u2019s offshore company popped up as part of the ongoing global Pandora Papers reporting project, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and in which PREMIUM TIMES is The key participant.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and other documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nIn August 2007 Mr Oyedepo contracted the services of Business Centrum Limited, a London-based agent, to help him set up a company in the infamous tax haven for him and his immediate family.\n\nBusiness Centrum subsequently subcontracted Trident Trust Group, one of the world\u2019s leading secrecy enablers and one of the most notorious providers of offshore corporate and financial services.\n\nThe company, Zadok Investments Limited, was set up on August 20, 2007 with 50,000 ordinary shares with a value of $1.00 each.\n\nAlthough the directors of the company are Mr Oyedepo and his two sons \u2013 David (junior) and Isaac, every member of Mr Oyedepo\u2019s family are listed as shareholders.\n\nMr Oyedepo and his wife, Faith, are the largest shareholders with 30 percent of shares each.\n\nHis children \u2013 David (junior), who in 2016 was appointed resident pastor of the headquarters of the church, known as Faith Tabernacle, has 10 percent while Isaac, who is the resident pastor of the church\u2019s branch in Maryland, the United States of America, also has 10 per cent of the shares.\n\nLove and Joy \u2013 the two daughters of the cleric \u2013 were similarly given 10 percent shares each.\n\nThe documents did not reveal the exact businesses and transactions the offshore company was set up to conduct. The entity however appears to be the family\u2019s investment vehicle under which the family\u2019s wealth is warehoused for offshore management.\n\nWhen reached via his personal email address, Mr Oyedepo did not respond to questions sent to him seeking his comments.\n\nWe also sent the questions to the publicised emails of his church, including that of the church\u2019s branch in Maryland. Some of the emails returned undelivered while we did not receive any response for those that delivered.\n\nThe telephone number Mr Oyedepo listed in company documents failed to connect.\n\nBiblical reference\n\nMr Oyedepo may have tapped the name of his offshore company from the Bible. According to the books of 2 Samuel, 1 King and Ezekiel, Zadok was a loyal priest to the biblical King David.\n\nHe was instrumental in helping David suppress the rebellion of his son, Absalom.\n\nAnd he was also helpful to the enthronement of Solomon as David\u2019s successor being that he was the priest that anointed Solomon\u2019s head with oil at Gihon, which effectively made him his father\u2019s successor.\n\nAfter Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem, Zadok was the first high priest of the temple.\n\nAn entrepreneurial cleric\n\nWhile the cache of documents did not reveal what type of business the company was set up for, some of the documents revealed that the company was still active at least as recently as 2016 when Trident Trust filed a resolution of the company\u2019s board revalidating its list of directors.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Oyedepo, who felt \u201cinsulted\u201d by his $150 million valuation by Forbes Magazine in 2011, is one of the main proponents of prosperity gospel in Christendom and encapsulates this by his myriad of entrepreneurial endeavours.\n\n\u201cSome fellow said we are worth $150 million, I said that\u2019s an insult. $150 million? That\u2019s an insult. I\u2019m worth Philippians 4:19\u201d, he said while referring to the Forbes valuation.\n\nPhilippians 4:19 reads: \u201cAnd my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n\nRecently, while reacting to reports that some of the church\u2019s pastors were sacked without benefits, Mr Oyedepo, who described the sacked pastors as \u201cunfruitful\u201d and \u201cblatant failure\u201d, said his church had never lacked money.\n\n\u201cMoney? Nonsense! We\u2019ve never lacked it and yet we\u2019ve never prayed for it. We are just simply obeying God and he is backing up what he asks us to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cObedience will turn you to a living wonder. Just obey God. Have you seen us raise a prayer point of Oh God send us money?,\u201d he asked later during the speech.\n\nOutside his evangelical work, he is mainly known as the founder of one of Nigeria\u2019s most expensive universities, Covenant University. He also owns Landmark University, in Omu-Aran, Kwara State.\n\nHe also owns Faith Academy Limited alongside his wife, Faith. Faith Academy Limited is the company that runs the highbrow boarding secondary school that goes by the same name.\n\nMr Oyedepo is also known for his acquisition of at least four private jets which includes, a Gulfstream V jet, said to be worth at least $30 million, two other Gulfstream planes and a Bombardier Challenger aircraft, which he operates using another of his companies, Dominion Air Limited.\n\nDominion Air Limited was set up in 2005 and his second son, Isaac, is listed as one of its directors.\n\nCanaanland\n\nMr Oyedepo is also the owner of Hebron Oil Limited and a slew of other businesses mostly located in his Canaanland estate in Ota, Ogun State.\n\nAnother company, Biblematch Media Limited, has David Oluwamakinde Oyedepo and Olukemi Omolola Oyedepo as directors.\n\nNigerian pastors and tax havens\n\nAs it was reported in 2013 how Chris Oyakhilome, one of Africa\u2019s most popular pastors, secretly incorporated Gmobile Nigeria, Limited, an offshore company for his family in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nA business associate of the pastor told this newspaper at the time that some directors in the company held shares on behalf of the pastor\u2019s daughters, Sharon and Charlyn, who were then teenagers.\n\nThe shareholders listed in the documents included Oyakhilome\u2019s wife at the time, Anita; another pastor in his organization, Thomas Amenkhienan; a business associate, Aigobomian Inegbedion; and another British Virgin Islands company, GTMT International Group Limited.\n\nIn 2016, another popular pastor, T.B. Joshua, was also exposed for secretly setting up an offshore business entity.\n\nThis is obtained from the massive leaked data of a Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, had shown that Mr Joshua and his wife, Evelyn, owned Chillon Consultancy Limited, a company incorporated on June 20, 2006 at the British Virgin Island (BVI).\n\nBoth owners owned one ordinary share each, although the company, with registration number 1033675, was authorised to issue a maximum \u201c50,000 no par value Shares of a single class.\u201d\n\nThe pastor died on June 5, this year, and his wife has been battling some congregation members over the management of the church\u2019s assets.",

          "text": ".\n\nArewa Consultative Forum has commended President Muhammadu Buhari on the 2022 budget presentation, but urged government to reduce the interest rates to enable growth of small and medium businesses, in a bid to reduce kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nACF National Chairman, Chief Audu Ogbeh, who made the call on Saturday, noted that high interest rate will not only stifle access to credit, businesses and the economy, but it would also have adverse effects on the younger generation and force them to engage in crime to make money.\n\nAccording to Ogbeh, \u201cI congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari for his presentation of the budget estimates of the 2022 fiscal year. The Forum appreciates the desire and commitment of his administration to take steps to expand and concretize the infrastructure base without which economic growth will be a mirage.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also want to commend government on the new onslaught on bandit and criminals nationwide. We are however worried that no mention was made of the problem of interest rate. For nearly three decades, we have endured the most outrageous interest rates that any developing country can endure. .\n\n\u201cHow can we continue to pay lip service to the vital issue of the growth of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMSEs), the prosperity of the younger generation, if we make it impossible for them to access credit..\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the efforts of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), but we regret to say those efforts will not solve the problem when commercial banks are still charging 27-30% (as interest rates). What kind of business will anybody do with such interest rates?.\n\n\u201cWe wish to caution that that unless and until we hurriedly establish a mechanism to deal with the current national tragedy where our children have resolved that the fastest way to their personal economic recovery is kidnapping, the Nigerian economy cannot experience real growth if access to reasonable credit remains forever blocked.\u201d",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

We continue to face security threats and violent crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and politically motivated killings which threaten our national integration,\u201d he said, according to a statement signed by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu.\n\n\u201cI assure you that this administration will continue to do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all forms of violent crimes that are creating fear and anxiety among the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state in this regard that, we have received new equipment in our fight against any form of insecurity from our friendly countries.\n\n\u201cThese assets will be deployed to accelerate the fight against insecurity in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that security had assumed priority in governance and public policy in international scheme of affairs.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we introduced a new Landing Ship Tank early this year to replace the first set of naval ship tanks which were decommissioned by the Nigerian Navy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the Landing Ship Tank is expected to bolster the Navy\u2019s Sealift capability and promote our global maritime commerce, peace and safety within the Gulf of Guinea and our maritime neighbourhood.\u201d\n\nThe President said the administration was poised to eliminate the incentives for corruption by addressing some of the remote causes as part of a long-term strategy for a more effective and sustained war on the practice.\n\nHe said improvement of livelihoods of citizens had been going on in partnership with relevant organized private sector.\n\nAccording to him, some of the interventions by government are: \u201cA smart law enforcement; provision of improved access to education that prepares our youths for global competitiveness; provision of quality health services for improved life expectancy and decent and affordable housing, among others.\n\n\u201cIt is the conviction of this administration that ineffective policies for social provisioning must be redressed in our efforts to tackle the fundamental causes of corruption in our society. This is how best to give vent to the much-cherished values of fairness, equity and justice to the people of this nation.\n\n\u201cI must also emphasize here that, for us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous and democratic country that will attract foreign investors we must be law abiding, committed and promoters of peaceful co-existence. This is a collective responsibility which will definitely yield the Nigeria of our dreams.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari commended the Commandant of the NDA, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, for the infrastructural upgrade in the military institution, and the colourful parade by the cadets of 68 regular course.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens my heart to see the level of infrastructural development in the Academy. It is a clear testament to the vision, dedication and excellence in the best tradition of NDA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigerians acknowledge that the Academy has consistently justified its existence over the years by turning out well trained and disciplined officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria as well as militaries of allied nations.\n\n\u201cThe NDA has over the years trained and graduated military and paramilitary personnel as well as interested civilians seeking postgraduate education. It is therefore not surprising that the Academy has earned a reputation as an outstanding military Academy in Africa. Let me therefore extend my sincere felicitation to the Commandant, staff and gentlemen cadets of the Academy on this memorable occasion.\u201d\n\nThe President, who was the Reviewing Officer, told Graduating Officer Cadets, that the world they were entering was very different from that which confronted many of their predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe contemporary security environment has been described as violent, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\n\n\u201cYou can therefore expect that the missions that you will be tasked to undertake will be similarly complex. Beyond these significant rationales, I am convinced that we have a real stake, and an abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school children are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of their tribe, faith or political beliefs.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, a former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have led Nigeria astray for the past 21 years.\n\nSpeaking during a lecture organised by Kwara Visioners Network for Rural Development in Kwara State, Jega said the two dominant parties are becoming incapable of directing the country in the right way.\n\n\u201cThe current two dominant parties \u2013 APC and the PDP \u2013 with their quality recruitment and leadership selection processes who have shared power and have tended to lead Nigeria astray in the past 21 years are becoming incapable of directing Nigerian political and governance processes in the right direction,\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe dominant elites in these parties are self-centered, preventing the few good ones among them to be impactful. They are also fractious and quarrelsome and lacking even enlightened self-interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to the professor of Political Science, there is a need to create a special vehicle that can go into alliance and work together to free the country from the stranglehold of parochial and reckless politicians.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\nPDP NEC Approves Zoning Of National Chairmanship Position To The North\n\n2023: Zoning Is Not The Solution To Nigeria\u2019s Problems, Says Atiku\n\n\u2018The Major Hindrance\u2019\n\nJega also dismissed speculations in some quarters that he was joining the 2023 presidential race, noting that his mission was to contribute to positive change in politics.\n\nWhile stating that he is a registered member of the People\u2019s Redemption Party (PRP), Jega noted that he hasn\u2019t told anyone he is interested in running for the position.\n\nThe ex-INEC Chairman also reacted to moves for the electronic transmission of results in general elections, criticising the National Assembly for downplaying its importance.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that prohibits the use of technology is a hindrance to electronic voting, asking the lawmakers to remove the legal encumbrance for electronic voting to be possible in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn fact, INEC has used it in some elections in parts of the country. It is a pilot scheme which all the stakeholders have been observing and said is good.\n\n\u201cThe next thing is to remove the major hindrance in the use of technology because there is a constitutional provision which says that electronic voting is prohibited,\u201d the former INEC boss explained.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians who are in support of electronic voting are blaming INEC for saying it cannot use electronic voting. They have forgotten that there is a legal provision that says electronic voting is prohibited.\u201d",

Sending him to Nigeria means certain death.\u201d\n\nChannels Television had reported that armed security men stormed Igboho\u2019s residence in Ibadan on July 1, an incident that resulted in a firefight that sparked tension in the Soka area of the Oyo State capital.\n\nHours later, the Department of State Services (DSS) claimed responsibility in a statement, saying the invasion was a raid by a joint team of security operatives.\n\nIt claimed that Igboho and others plotted to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State and asked the Yoruba nation agitator to turn himself in at the nearest security agency.\n\nIgboho\u2019s associates arrested by the DSS were later paraded and detained for over two months despite the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordering their release.\n\nThe Yoruba nation agitator, on the other hand, fled the country to Benin but was later arrested by authorities en route to Germany.\n\nWhile the Federal Government is making effort to extradite him, Salami insisted that Nigerian authorities have yet to officially begin the process.\n\n\u201cWhat we feared at the start was an extradition request but there is no such demand,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he is being investigated for a violation that could have been committed on Beninese territory is a hurdle to an extradition request as this case will first have to be sorted out.\u201d",

          "text": "Pope Francis met on Saturday with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Catholic who has come under criticism from some bishops in the United States for her support for abortion rights.\n\nTheir meeting took place several weeks before Joe Biden is expected to meet the pope while the U.S. president is in Rome for talks between leaders of the Group of 20 major economies. Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but, as a politician, cannot impose his views. Pelosi, who has five children, has said she supports a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration and Pelosi have urged judges to block a new Texas law which bars abortions from six weeks, saying it is unconstitutional. The ban was temporarily reinstated on Friday by a conservative-leaning appeals court.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that human life begins at the moment of conception and Biden and Pelosi have been criticised by conservative Catholic media and U.S. conservative bishops, some of whom say neither should be allowed to receive communion. Last month the pope, asked about the U.S. communion debate, told reporters abortion is \u201cmurder\u201d, even soon after conception, and appeared to criticise U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than pastoral way. \u201cCommunion is not a prize for the perfect \u2026 communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,\u201d the pope said. In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. They take up the issue again next month. In a statement, Pelosi said the audience with the pope was a \u201cspiritual, personal and official honor\u201d. She praised his defence of the environment, immigrants, refugees and the poor. The Vatican announced Pelosi\u2019s audience with the pope in its daily bulletin but gave no details.\n\nAfter Pelosi met former Pope Benedict in 2009, the Vatican said he had told her that legislators and other public figures should help create \u201ca just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development\u201d. The archbishop in Pelosi\u2019s home city of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, has said public figures who support abortion should be denied communion in his archdiocese and has urged Catholics to pray for Pelosi\u2019s \u201cconversion of heart\u201d. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, D.C., has not tried to stop Biden, a regular church-goer, from receiving communion.",

Gloria Cecilia Narvaez was released on Saturday after more than four years in captivity.\n\nShe was kidnapped by the Macina Liberation Front, an al-Qaeda-linked group, in February 2017 near the border with Burkina Faso.\n\nFollowing her release, Narvaez met with Mali\u2019s interim President Assimi Goita.\n\n\u201cI first thank God, who is the light and the peace, I thank the Malian authorities, the president for all the efforts made so that I am free,\u201d she said in a brief statement made on state television.\n\nPhotos posted on the Malian presidency\u2019s Twitter feed showed Narvaez, smiling and dressed in a yellow robe and headscarf, as she met with Goita.\n\n\u201cThe presidency of Mali salutes the courage and bravery of the nun. This liberation is the crowning achievement of four years and eight months of combined efforts by several intelligence services,\u201d the presidency said in a statement.\n\nA source close to the negotiations to release her told the AFP news agency that the nun had not been ill-treated during her captivity, during which she had learned the Quran.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations lasted months, years,\u201d said the source, without giving further details.\n\nIn Colombia, National Police Director Jorge Luis Vargas welcomed news of Narvaez\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cToday is very good news for Colombia, but also for the national police for all the efforts made over the years to secure the safe release of our compatriot,\u201d he said.\n\nVargas said meetings had been held with several European and African ambassadors to try to secure the nun\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cWith Interpol, and with other international organisations, we have always sought to bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\n\nHe did not say whether any ransom was paid for Narvaez.\n\nMali has been struggling since 2012 to contain violence linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL-affiliated groups.\n\nThe fighters have now expanded their operations from their strongholds in the country\u2019s desert north to its centre as well as neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nKidnapping, once rare, has now become a lucrative source of cash for the armed groups.\n\nIn April, a French journalist was abducted in northern Mali.\n\nIn a hostage video, Olivier Dubois said the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), the largest alliance of armed groups in the Sahel, had kidnapped him.\n\nGunmen abducted three Chinese nationals and two Mauritanians from a construction site in southwestern Mali in July.",
