          "text": "The Federal Government on Monday expressed worry over the incessant attacks on critical public facilities such as police stations and the Independent National Electoral Commission, describing it as not just vandalism but terrorism.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said this in Abuja during a town hall meeting on protecting public infrastructure, organised in conjunction with the National Orientation Agency.\n\nThe event was attended by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, SAN; his Transportation counterpart, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammed Bello, and his Aviation counterpart, Hadi Sirika.\n\nDuring the event, Bello said the FCT administration would \u201cneed N2.6bn to replace 25,462 assets vandalised in the FCT.\u201d\n\nBut earlier, Mohammed said that in recent times, laudable efforts of the government had been thwarted by some unpatriotic citizens through wanton destruction of critical infrastructure.\n\nHe said, \u201cRailway tracks are being subjected to destruction, bridge railings are being removed, manhole covers are being pilfered, streetlights and other power infrastructure, oil pipelines, telecoms facilities and critical aviation infrastructure are being damaged or stolen.\n\n\u201cOn another level are the incessant attacks on critical public facilities such as police stations and INEC offices. As a matter of fact, the destruction of public infrastructure and facilities is not just vandalism; it is a form of terrorism.\n\n\u201cRemoval of rail tracks can cause train derailment, with deadly consequences. Tampering with aviation infrastructure endangers the lives of air passengers. Attacks on police stations have left many police personnel dead. These are all acts of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said the town hall meeting will be the first of a three-part series that would address vandalism of public infrastructure across the country.\n\nIn his speech, Bello said recent findings revealed that 400 foul water manhole covers, 582 storm water covers and 23,210 gully pot covers were vandalised in the FCT.\n\n\u201cOverall, we are talking of over 25,000 covers of one form or the other and these are critical public assets. This is just one aspect. In some streets where blackout is noticed, one would think it is a public blackout, it is not.\n\nIt (blackout) occurs simply because somebody decides to dig out the cables.\u201d\n\nBello called on security agencies not to see vandalism of public assets as a minor crime because it constituted a threat to lives.",

It should be thrown open and giving total overhauling.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO2020 WASSCE/BECE Exams: Lagos slams N13.5m fine against 27 schools over malpractice, sanctions 19 others\n\nHe added that \u201cThe Bill is complicated as this is the third time that we will be addressing the issue of pension. So we will take this opportunity to give it a global look and allow those retirees that have been denied the opportunity of accessing their benefits to come and be part of it.\n\n\u201cAlso the professionals along this line to come on board and tell us what should be done so that we can have a perfect work on the matter and have a lasting solution \u201c\n\nOluyinka Ogundimu, Chairman Committee on Establishments, Training, Pensions and Public Service while highlighting the proposed amendment stated that it is recommended that the provisions of section 89 (2) of the Pension Commission Act and Guidelines issued by it should apply instead of the State having its own provision.\n\nIt also stated that the Certificate of Clearance should be issued within 21 days of the employee\u2019s retirement or dismissal from Service.\n\nThe letter allows retirees easy access to their pension account, this has, however, been amended to read \u201cLetter of Confirmation of Exit\u201d to be issued within twenty-one (21) days prior to the employee\u2019s retirement or exit from the Lagos State Public Service for easy access to their retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nWhile stating the importance of the Bill, Sanai Agunbiade, reiterated that the Bill will respond to the welfare of the citizens of Lagos State who have worked tenaciously and enable them to get what is due to them.\n\nAbiodun Tobun while lending his support for the Bill expressed that if passed into law, the Bill will make life easier for retirees from service\n\n\u201cThe Bill will give the assurance to retirees that they will get what duly belongs to them after leaving the active service,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn his contribution, Femi Saheed stated that the advantages of the Bill are enormous, such as saving the cost of governance and equally having enough money in the economy through the pull of funds.\n\nRotimi Abiru said: \u201cThe Bill seeks to bring to conformity functions of the Lagos State Civil Service and Pensions Commission and to protect pensioners from managers and to ensure that pensioners get their money in good time.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker, subsequently, committed the Bill to the Committee on Establishments, Training, Pensions and Public Service to report back in two weeks.",

          "title": "Twitter ban: Nigerians have rights to challenge the unconstitutional decision",
          "text": "Munirudeen Adeyanju is a Nigerian-American lawyer and cyber security consultant. In this interview with DAILY POST\u2019s Francis Ezediuno, he bares his mind on the recent Twitter suspension by the Federal Government, its implications, why the government is wrong in its decision and the rights of Nigerians to challenge the Twitter ban.\n\nExcerpts;\n\nTwitter suspension in Nigeria. What is happening l?\n\nRegarding the recent Twitter ban by the Federal Government, there are two trajectories you must look at. Now, from the national security perspective as well as the rights of the citizens perspective. One iron sharpens the other.\n\nHowever, the constitution of the land reigns supreme and even national security laws would be somewhat subject to the rights of the citizens. The right to freedom of expression by any average citizen in whatever platform or social avenue is sacrosanct and non-negotiable. The ban by the Federal Government of Twitter is absolutely at variance with the constitution of Nigeria.\n\nThis is not what the June 12, 1993 anti-democracy fight was all about. This is not what it was all about.\n\nAs a matter of fact, let\u2019s go back to what the statement of the president was. The statement copiously alludes to the fact of the tragic horrors of a civil war. It could be replicated. It was a war chant so to speak. That was not the best choice of words.\n\nIn public policy, what is expected is that the policy directive defines the problem at hand. Then you address it. The social media handlers of Mr. President did not address the issues at hand. It was a badly crafted narrative by the Federal Government and Twitter whatever their consideration but factually based on their community guidelines, the language of that tweet was against their community guidelines and it was open to flagging.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also did the same thing and he was checked. Section 26 of the Cyber Crime Act of Nigeria, that was signed by President Muhammadu Buhari copiously states and prohibits the use of racial or xenophobic statements.\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet was xenophobic. It consists of racial undertones. Everybody knows that the Igbos in the South East suffered imaginable horrors during the civil war. So why should he refer to such a tragic path of history and use it against the same set of people that are clamouring against Insecurity in the land. The same plan that the president campaigned with in 2015 and 2019. We have seen now after six years that this government has been grossly incompetent.\n\nPro-ban advocates have been saying that Twitter operates with terms and conditions while Nigeria operates with rules and laws. How do you marry that?\n\nTwitter is a company registered under the laws of a land. Because of the unique space it operates in, Twitter traverses the information and cyber space. The flow of information and data is universal and global. Under the terms and conditions of Twitter, they operate globally. Anyone that uses Twitter through their official or personal handle, including Mr. President has accepted to subordinate himself to the terms and conditions of that company.\n\nKeneChukwu Okeke: Twitter: My concerns about foreign countries interference on Nigerian cyber space\n\nIf the terms and conditions of Twitter was at variance with the rules and laws of Nigeria, Nigerians as a whole including the telecommunications companies through which Nigerians participate on the Twitter platform to trade and do business would have rejected it. Nigeria would not be party to it. Nigeria has been party to several telecommunications agreements through the International Communication Union. By doing so, Nigerians laws and regulations have been subordinated to global agreements. If Nigeria\u2019s interests were not addressed by those agreements, Nigeria should not be a party to it.\n\nLet us come back home, both the Minister of Information and Culture and his colleagues in the Communication and Digital Economy Ministry have transgressed against Nigerian laws. Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy is known to have had harboured terrorists views and he is still a minister till today.\n\nBetween ban and regulations, which line should the government toe and what is your view on such a decision?\n\nSocial media regulation is a very strong issue because it runs through three very thin lines. It bothers on privacy, freedom of speech and expression and the right to association. It is a grey area that one has to be very careful about. In regulating social media, as long as those regulations do not impact on these universally accepted fundamental rights afforded to a human being, social media regulation is not the way to go.\n\nPastor Adeboye tweets, insists RCCG will not comply with FG\u2019s Twitter ban\n\nIn the course of regulation, there is serious danger that those rights will be taken away and we cannot afford that under a democratic system of government.\n\nWhat of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice\u2019s threat that law enforcement agents should arrest people still using Twitter despite the suspension?\n\nThe government directive does not have the force of law. It is not a law or regulation. It can still be challenged. What I expect is for people to challenge it. The first thing anybody arrested should do is to challenge the directive.\n\nPeople should speak up. We are under a democracy. We are not somebody\u2019s personal fiefdom. Nigeria is bigger than any individual. Nigeria is bigger than Mr. President. We elected Mr. President. He is subject to us, we are not subject to him. The rule of law must prevail.\n\nWhat is the solution to this whole impasse?\n\nThe president should reverse the Twitter ban, that is the way forward and the only solution.\n\nWhat about the statement from the Presidency, citing reasons for the Federal Government\u2019s decision to suspend the operation of the platform in Nigeria?\n\nWith due respect to Malam Garba Shehu who I know is a professional, I am very sorry that his argument holds no water. You cannot poke a lion in the eye and then turn around to tell it sorry, let us now dialogue. Neither can you poke your brother in the eye and then turn around to say you are sorry, we should dialogue.\n\nIn the same vein, you cannot sleep with your friend\u2019s wife and then turn around to say you are sorry and opt for dialogue. The right of an individual to express himself is guaranteed under the constitution of Nigeria. It is an inalienable right. That is why in other civilised places of the world, where we have several High Commissions and Embassies, because we want to see trade and investment flowing into Nigeria, we conform with their laws and they allow us to express ourselves. When citizens are arrested, they read to them their rights.\n\nProfessionally, a lot of people have forgotten what they are all about. They should be able to look their Principal in the eye and declare they cannot do such and if the Principal insists, they should resign. It is not the end of the world.\n\nThe essence of nation building entails that sometimes, the individual has to swallow their pride.\n\nFG reveals condition for lifting ban on Twitter",

If someone says the sky is brown, it is not for the media to report verbatim that A said the sky is brown.\n\n\u201cThe Media also have a role to fact-check and see for themselves the actual colour of the sky; if not, you are helping propagate falsehood and division.\n\nIf you are fighting insecurity and criminal elements, the oxygen with which they thrive is propaganda and reportage of their activities so the Nigerian Media needs to decide to what extent they want to continue being the propagators of the actions of criminal elements.\n\nBoko Haram elements have taken over Niger State \u2013 Gov Bello cries out\n\n\u201cThe media has a responsibility to save this country by de-escalating the reportage of the activities of criminal elements. I am not advocating for a media blackout on criminality. Far from it, I am only saying that the Media should help us by not offering exposure and propaganda outlets to criminal elements. The way we are going, I am afraid that we are playing into the hands of those who are profiting from the crisis situation in the country\u201d.\n\nContinuing, Ikpeazu stated, \u201cthe Media has also unwittingly promoted label-culture and stereotyping such that people from certain groups are labeled collectively as a result of the actions of a few and there is a haste to ascribe crimes to them because the public has been led to believe that they are the ones who commit certain types of crimes.\n\n\u201cThis is an ill-wind that will note bode well for us in our quest for national unity. Security agencies must be given the chance to conduct investigations and come out with official reports before we ascribe crimes to their perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe practice of reporting crime and criminal activities with assumed suspected perpetrators will only cause further division among us and perhaps, exonerate the real culprits. I call on the media once again to be circumspect and install effective internal professional checks and balances in crime reportage,\u201d Governor Ikpeazu concluded.\n\nNCC to balance competition with disruptive technologies for sustainable telecoms\u2019 growth \u2013 Prof Danbatta",

          "text": "The United States (U.S.) Supreme Court has ruled against immigrants legally living in the country with \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d (TPS) from green card eligibility if they initially entered the country without legal permission.\n\nThe decision is seen as a a blow to the thousands of immigrants who have relied on that legal status to gain a foothold into permanent residence in the country.\n\nThe unanimous decision from the nation\u2019s high court on yesterday could impact thousands of people living in the U.S. under those protections, which are granted to immigrants fleeing violence and unsafe conditions in their home countries.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Jose Santos Sanchez and Sonia Gonzalez, fled El Salvador in the 1990s and have lived in the US for nearly 30 years. Their youngest son is a US citizen. When El Salvador received a TPS designation in 2001, they applied and were granted status and have maintained it since. When Mr Sanchez applied for a green card in 2014, he was denied.\n\n\u201cThe question here is whether the conferral of TPS enables him to obtain [Legal Permanent Residency] status despite his unlawful entry. We hold that it does not,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the court\u2019s opinion.\n\nFederal law provides that immigrants who are \u201cinspected and admitted\u201d into the US may apply for an adjustment to their status, or for lawful permanent residence, commonly known as a green card. TPS holders and advocates have argued that the arduous process of obtaining that status should fulfil the \u201cinspected and admitted\u201d requirements.\n\nBut Justice Kagen argued that a TPS designation is not itself an \u201cadmission\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn \u2018admission\u2019 is defined as \u2018the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorisation by an immigration officer,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe TPS program gives foreign nationals nonimmigrant status, but it does not admit them. \u2026 Because a grant of TPS does not come with a ticket of admission, it does not eliminate the disqualifying effect of an unlawful entry.\u201d\n\nRoughly 400,000 immigrants are living in the US with TPS protections from a dozen countries, including Burma, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, those who were not lawfully admitted before they received their TPS protections, many of whom are from Central America, could be at risk of being deported when those protections expire.\n\nClaudia Lainez, a TPS holder and regional organiser for the National TPS Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 groups advocating for permanent residency statuses for TPS recipients, called the decision a \u201chuge blow for one of the only available avenues for our families to adjust their status\u201d in the US.\n\nImmigration advocacy organisations, civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said that the court\u2019s decision underscores an urgency to pass immigration reform in Congress that could secure a path to lawful residence for thousands of immigrants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis will not deter our struggle for obtaining green cards for all TPS holders,\u201d Ms Lainez said in a statement. \u201cThis news only emphasizes the fact that Congress must act now to guarantee permanent protections and for President Biden to expand the TPS status to everyone who deserves it.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a sweeping immigration reform bill in March that would create a citizenship process for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children, or Dreamers, as well as TPS recipients. The measure passed by a vote of 228-197.\n\nUS Senator Ben Cardin, among lead sponsors of a Senate measure, the SECURE Act, that would provide a pathway to permanent residence for TPS recipients, said that TPS protections are \u201csupposed to show that the US is the Land of Compassion to those in humanitarian distress.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s SCOTUS decision instead makes ours the Land of the Broken Promise,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration renewed TPS designation for Haiti, which Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said is \u201cexperiencing serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources, which are exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOn the heels of that decision, a coalition of immigration advocacy groups and activists to pass the SECURE Act have pushed Congress and the administration to \u201cprovide a long-term solution for immigrants who have made America their home and who contribute immensely to the fabric of our nation,\u201d said Namrata Pokhrel, a Nepali TPS holder from Texas.\n\n\u201cLiving deadline to deadline, under the constant threat of being sent back to perilous conditions is not protection,\u201d she said in a statement.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFour days after the Federal Government slammed indefinite ban on use of Twitter, prominent Nigerians have continued to flout the order.\n\nThose who have dared the FG include Governors of Kaduna and Ondo states, Nasir El-Rufai and Rotimi Akeredolu respectively, former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose and senators Dino Melaye and Shehu Sani\n\nGovernment had on Friday imposed suspension on Twitter alleging persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the ban on activities of the microblogging platform by Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Minister of Justice and AGF, Abubakar Malami have directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) in his office to swing into action and commence the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government\u2019s de-activation of operations of Twitter\n\nBut prominent clerics, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye and the General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, yesterday, posted separate tweets reacting to the ban of the microblogging platform.\n\nAdeboye said tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d the cleric tweeted.\n\nExplaining why Deeper Life Church would remain active on Twitter, Kumuyi said his tweets were targetted at over 100 nations where the church has branches. He said the church made use of Twitter to share contents from any of the locations across the five continents.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMocking the FG last night, Shehu Sani tweeted: \u201cYou have to come to Twitter to know who is in Twitter and coming is a Taboo.\u201d\n\nAlso defying the order, yesterday, Ayodele Fayose tweeted: \u201cAnyone they arrest will only end up being celebrated. No one should be moved by empty threats of arrest. Certainly, what has a beginning must have an end. This dictatorial govt came and shall definitely go. No shaking!\n\n\u201cGood days ahead\u201d while Melaye agreed with Pastor Adeboye that \u201cUnited Nations Charter of which Nigeria is a signatory and have since domesticated.\u201d\n\nEarlier, El-Rufai and Akeredolu, both members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), had tweeted through their verified accounts, daring Malami\u2019s prosecution threats. At exactly 9:37 p.m. on Sunday, Kaduna governor shared an opinion article titled: \u201cBased Nigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny\u201d.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu also posted a statement reacting to the night attack that claimed several lives in Igangan community in Oyo State on Sunday.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s media aide, Muyiwa Adekeye said he had been outside the country for over a week, noting, \u201cthe activities of Twitter is not banned in the country.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson of Governor Akeredolu, Olabode Richard, also argued that the microblogging platform was accessible to Nigerians on Sunday, adding that his principal did not make use of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other alternatives being explored by Nigerians.\n\nIt, however, remains unclear if the order from the office of the AGF would be effected on, Adeboye, El-Rufai, Akeredolu and other \u201coffenders\u201d.\n\n\u2022FG could have handled it a lot better, says Sanwo-Olu\n\nSpeaking on a live television interview programme, yesterday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said considering the economic implications of the decision, the Federal Government could have handled the situation better.\n\n\u201cFederal government can handle this a lot better. Because of the number of eCommerce, the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cOn both sides, there are issues that can be resolved between Twitter and the government and I think what they\u2019ve done is not a ban but a suspension like they said, so in the period of suspension let us sit down.\n\n\u201cIf we have 40 million users of that micro-blogger and another country has five million and they chose to take their investment to a country that have five million compared to a country with 40 million. It speaks to the reason we need to have that conversation with them. Probably if they have an office here things would have been done a lot quicker and better.\u201d\n\n\u2022Envoys maintain position on ban\n\nFederal Government, yesterday, met envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Canadian Government and the Government of Ireland over their response to its ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThe meeting which was at the instance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, followed a statement jointly issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian Government, and the Republic of Ireland at the weekend, expressing disappointment over the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations.\n\nPrior to the joint statement, the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, had issued a separate statement where it said the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard; the British Deputy High commissioner, Gill Atkinson; Canadian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Nicolas Simard; the Political Adviser on Maritime and Security, Politics, Press and Information Section, Delegation of European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Thomas Kieler; and the Charge d\u2019Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland, Mr Conor Finn.\n\nOnyeama said the meeting was as a result of the statement jointly issued by the missions which was forwarded to him.\n\nOnyeama further said he felt it was absolutely appropriate to take their comments very seriously and meet with the heads of missions due to the respect for their countries and in view of the relationship with the affected countries.\n\nHe also said the meeting was in their usual friendly way, to discuss and share opinions with respect to the Twitter ban and clarify certain things.\n\n\u201cSo, it was for that reason that I have invited you here this morning, not summon, invited to discuss some of these issues,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, Leonard said as partners, they want to see Nigeria succeed, unified, peaceful and prosperous.\n\nAsked if they were withdrawing their statement, Leonard said they recognised that there were issues of irresponsible use of social media, but \u201cwe remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express oneself is actually very important, and perhaps, even more important in troubled times.\u201d\n\n\u2022FG to sanction broadcast stations using Twitter\n\nThe Federal Government has directed broadcast stations to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in programmes.\n\nThe directive was issued in Abuja by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in a statement by its Acting Director-General, Professor Armstrong Idachaba.\n\nNBC said it would be unpatriotic for any broadcaster to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information.\n\n\u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of User Generated Content (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u2018the broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than Crime and Anarchy,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\nIdachaba further said attention was also drawn to Section 5.6.3 of the Broadcast Code which required broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a UGC.\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\n\u2022Asking TV, radio stations to deactivate accounts unlawful \u2013 SERAP\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has condemned the directive by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to all broadcast stations in the country to suspend patronage of Twitter with immediate effect as \u201cthe patently unlawful and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNBC had reportedly stated that the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over purported use of the platform for \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare said the directive by the NBC is itself unlawful because it is based on another unlawful decision by the Federal Government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NBC\u2019s directive has political interference written all over it. It is a blow to Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression, media freedom, media independence and diversity. The directive must be immediately withdrawn. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. This action by the NBC is yet another nail in the coffin for human rights, media freedom and independent journalism under this government.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should publicly and vigorously express concerns over the Nigerian government\u2019s increasingly brutal crackdown on media freedom, and use all possible means to urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to protect and respect freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u2022Stop mocking democracy, Norsemen tell FG\n\nAn international humanitarian body, De Norsemen KClub International has kicked against the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter, saying it was an ambush on the nation\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nThe group said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was mocking democracy, adding that it was appalled that a government that came in through a democratic process, and prided itself as an upholder of democratic principles, could take such brazing unpopular decision without recourse to democratic principles and constitutionality.\n\nIn statement by it International President, Dr. Adeshola Giwa, on Monday, De Norsemen stated its belief and commitment to free speech, noting that only a government that had something to hide would abridge freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cDe Norsemen Kclub International wish to remind the Federal Government that a government that has nothing to hide is not afraid of free speech. The rule should be: let the people express themselves and take responsibility of their expressions. We want to emphasize that freedom of speech is an inalienable constitutional right of citizens. Citizens\u2019 right to free expression is non-negotiable and it is only a court of competent jurisdiction, and not the fiat of government, that can determine when the expression of citizens runs foul of the law.\u201d",

The deceased was said to be on his way to catch a flight to Lagos. A survivor stated that one of the Air Force operatives shot the car of Oguchi when he failed to stop at the Air Force checkpoint after they had flagged him down.\n\n\u201cFollowing the information, the Air Force team at the toll gate, who were already on red alert, especially considering the recent killing of a high profile politician around the same area, intercepted a fast approaching Mercedes Benz vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey flagged down the vehicle and ordered the driver to park by the roadside for search, but the driver who, at first, slowed down and pretended to move to the side of the road, suddenly took off.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Air Force, being suspicious of the mission of the occupants of the said vehicle at the International Airport, they made an effort to demobilise the vehicle. When the vehicle eventually came to a halt, the operatives rounded it and ordered the occupants out.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that a female passenger in the car mentioned that the man driving the vehicle was her husband and that he was rushing to catch his flight. He was, however, rushed to the hospital by the Air Force team for medical attention, where the doctors on duty made frantic efforts to stabilise him. He later died at about 1900 hours of the same date.\n\n\u201cImo State Police Command has commenced investigation into the case. The Commissioner of Police called for calm and assured family and friends of the deceased person that no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the circumstances surrounding the death. Members of the public will be updated on the outcome of the investigation.\u201d Yaro stated.",

The committee was composed of members of the South East Security Committee, the Attorney Generals of the five southeast states and some prominent Igbo sons and daughters. The 21-man Legal Framework Committee was funded to completion by the Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cOn April 11, 2021, South East Governors announced the formation of Ebubeagu at Owerri. Subsequently, the draft legal framework produced by the 21-man committee was reviewed by South East Security Committee members and the Attorney Generals of the five Southeast states to suit South East Ebubeagu security outfit.\n\n\u201cThe South East Security Committee thoroughly prepared and submitted the modalities, including the structure, for the take-off of Ebubeagu to the Governors\u2019 Forum during their meeting, attended by the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and some other Igbo leaders and a request that Ebubeagu should be jointly rolled out as a matter of urgency and also funded by the government of the five South East States.\n\n\u201cFrom inception to date, the South East Security Committee was never funded at all in any capacity and not even an office space was provided.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture that Ebubeagu will soon come fully on-stream, I respectfully request that Your Excellencies kindly permit me to resign my appointment as the chairman, South East Security Committee.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of my love to serve Ndigbo, I can assure you that I will always be available to advice on the success of Ebubeagu at no cost, just as I served as the Chairman of South East Security Committee from August 31, 2019, till date at no cost directly or indirectly to the five South East state government, groups and individual.\n\n\u201cI highly appreciate Your Excellencies for the opportunity you gave me to serve Ndigbo.

          "title": "Twitter Loses Billions, Nigerians Lose Instant Communication Tools",
          "text": "\u2022Govt communication system in shambles as agencies return to old, archaic mode of information dissemination\n\n\u2022Buhari, Osinbajo, MDAs suspend tweeting\n\n\u2022Akeredolu, el-Rufai, Makinde defy directive\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFederal government\u2019s suspension of the operation of American micro-blogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria, might have left both in a catch-22 situation as the duo have lost millions of followers that they had built for more than half a decade.\n\nFor Twitter the saga has cost it billions of cash, while Nigerians, in both private and public sectors have lost their means of instant communication.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had last week announced the suspension of Twitter after the firm deleted some aspects of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, which the company found to be in breach of its rules.\n\nFollowing searing attacks of the suspension by social activists, who said it was an abuse of Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Section 39 (1) of the Constitution as altered, Muhammed added an extra reason for the act, saying the temporary prohibition of the internet platform was a response to the firm\u2019s persistent violation of the nation\u2019s national security interest.\n\nThe suspension order had attracted a directive from the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), asking all Telcos and broadcasting media to deactivate their Twitter handles and block access to the internet facility.\n\nMany Nigerians, have, however, circumvented the federal government\u2019s blockage of the micro-blogging facility, resorting to the virtual private network (VPN) to connect Twitter.\n\nAlthough THISDAY\u2019s checks showed that Buhari, his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and many government agencies, including the armed forces, ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), have suspended tweeting, some governors including Malam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) and Mr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo) have continued to tweet in defiance of the federal government\u2019s directive.\n\nAnalysts, however, told THISDAY yesterday that both the federal government and Twitter must be feeling the rough edges of the suspension as they suffer its adverse effect.\n\nFor the Nigerian government, its agencies and millions of private sector users of the micro-blogging facility, it amounts to a loss of an instant communication tool, which had helped to facilitate the dissemination and receipt of information necessary for the conduct of their businesses.\n\nBuhari, for instance, said an analyst, has lost millions of his followers that it has taken him six years to build. \u201cHe may have to start afresh when he returns to the site,\u201d he said.\n\nAgencies like Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that had used its Twitter handle to instantly communicate with the public information on the COVID-19 pandemic, would now have to revert to other pre-Twitter messaging platforms, including e-mail, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram that are not as fast, another analyst explained last night.\n\nA day after Mohammed announced the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, had warned that violators of the ban would be prosecuted.\n\nBut senior lawyers have questioned the legality of Malami\u2019s order, saying that it is not grounded in law, adding that Nigerians could not be prosecuted for offences not specified by law.\n\nTo calm the global outrage that the suspension of Twitter has generated, the federal government yesterday met with ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland in Nigeria and sought their understanding on its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nBut save for the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, who deactivated her Twitter handle following the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, Buhari, Osinbajo and some other top government officials still retained their accounts, although they\u2019re inactive.\n\nHowever, the federal government\u2019s directive suspending Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was silent on whether or not Nigerians should deactivate their accounts.\n\nBut a directive yesterday by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had directed road and television stations in the country to de-install their Twitter accounts.\n\nChecks by THISDAY yesterday showed that Twitter accounts belonging to government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are also being retained.\n\nSome of the accounts being retained belong to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Chief Geoffrey Onyema; Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).\n\nOthers include the Nigerian Police, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the\n\nSuper Eagles, the official Twitter account of Nigerian football team; and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), among many others.\n\nWhile most of these accounts are not active, the same cannot be said of their aides who have bypassed the networks to tweet with their Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nAlso active are Twitter accounts of former Senators Shehu Sani and Dino Melaye, as well as el-Rufai who tweeted the link of a story on \u201cNigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny \u2014 RT Op-ed.\u201d\n\nWhile Akeredolu\u2019s last tweet, on the attack on Igangan community in Oyo State was at 7.11 pm on Sunday, Makinde, at 9.45 am, on Sunday, tweeted to urge for calm over the attack on Igangan.\n\nAlso, most churches are still active on Twitter with both Deeper Life Bible Church and Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), justifying their accounts being active on the grounds that they need to reach congregants in other countries.\n\nThe RCCG, in a clarification, said: \u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 nations & territories. The tweets here are in accordance with Article 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nArticle 19 of the UDHR said: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Deeper Life General Overseer, Pastor Williams Kumuyi said: \u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations.\u201d\n\nFG Seeks Support of US, UK, Others over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nThe federal government yesterday sought the understanding of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland over its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt, however, gave conditions to lift the suspension.\n\nAlso yesterday, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, called for a speedy resolution of the dispute.\n\nAddressing a press conference after a meeting with the five representatives of the missions in Abuja, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Onyeama, said they had a discussion concerning the issues of Twitter ban and based on the joint press statement earlier made by the missions.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had a useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. President and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said they presented first-hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe stated that social media is good for dissemination of information, but it can also be used for good and the bad.\n\nHe added that the bad side of it has dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nAccording to him, it is germane to keep the unity of the country and to achieve all these, a decision has to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms are used responsibly.\n\nHe said as a democracy, the issue of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, adding that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nHe stated that the five missions and their countries have been supporting Nigeria even with its security and development challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been having partnership and solidarity with the five countries. They have supported us very strongly in our security challenges, humanitarian crisis, development challenges and economic challenges, so we can say that these countries are our partners. We are asking them to also support us as we continue to confront all these challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to them and they also have their views on all of these issues and we gave them the opportunities to also expressed themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly gratified with the statement and reassurance of support and friendship towards Nigeria. We have to keep an eye on the main objective of this government, when Mr. President was elected, security was number one of his priorities and it is something he really wants to be able to deliver for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout security, everything else fails, investments go out of the country, regular migration out, it will be a vicious cycle.\n\n\u201cWe will all be losers and our children, generation to come will all be affected. What we do today will really determine the future of this country. That is why this government gives priority to security, that this government would have to live in peace and security. And we have to keep our country together.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today, will really define the future of the country and that is why Mr. \u201cPresident is absolutely determined that security has been made and Nigerians have to live in peace and security and that we have to keep our country together. We listened to each other and clarified some areas.\u201d\n\nOnyeama, however, said the government was already discussing with Twitter on lifting the suspension.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you yourself have said, discussions are ongoing with Twitter, we want to see how that progresses. So I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension. There are conversations with our partners and with social media.\n\n\u201cThe basic condition is really responsible communication. We know the power of words and the power of words for good and the power of words for bad. You know when you have that kind of power to manage and facilitate the communication of billions of people around the world; it has to come with responsibilities. Absolutely, it has to come with responsibilities. So the condition will be a responsible use of media and that really has to be adhered to.\u201d\n\nIn her response on behalf of the five missions, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth- Leonard, said: \u201cI will say that first of all that we recognise that there are issues of responsible use of social media but we remain firm on our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important perhaps on one part, but also at trouble times.\u201d\n\nShe urged Nigeria to identify those who commit crimes and use judicial processes to deal with offenders, adding \u201cbut to constrain, that is not the behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe envoy added that they were glad to hear that Nigeria was interacting with Twitter.\n\nOn the challenges confronting the country, she said: \u201cI think we made that statement very clear that we are Nigeria\u2019s strong partners. We recognise the daunting times in the area of security challenges that confronts Nigeria. Well, they are daunting, they are not insurmountable and part of the way you surmount them is through partnership.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had earlier summoned the envoys over their recent comments on the suspension.\n\nThe missions had in a joint statement condemned the suspension.\n\nNBC Orders Broadcast Stations to Suspend Twitter Patronage\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has ordered all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter with immediate effect.\n\nNBC said the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that could undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nThe acting Director-General of the NBC, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba, in a statement directed the broadcast stations to \u201cde-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with the responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of the Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite panic or rift in the society in the use of user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Media aide dismisses speculation\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere is rising tension in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following an alleged plan by the Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to transmute to the national chairman of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Buni\u2019s alleged ambition may have stopped the caretaker committee from announcing dates for national and states congresses in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to usher in new party leadership.\n\nSources familiar with the power game in the party told THISDAY that Buni\u2019s game plan is to resign his position as governor and join the race for the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nHe\u2019s billed to end second term tenure in May 2023.\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the claim, saying he has no intention to resign his position as governor.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given up to this month to conduct a national convention and states\u2019 congresses after a reconciliation of the members as well as the revalidation of membership registers.\n\nThe sources said a self-succession motive by Buni to become the substantive national chairman is currently stalling moves to hold a national convention.\n\nHowever, many of the governors elected on the platform of the party are said to be opposed to Buni\u2019s bid to transform into the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nThe APC governors opposed to the Buni\u2019s ambition, it was learnt, are those who would be rounding off their second term in office by 2023.\n\nAlso, the ministers who have political ambitions by 2023 are opposed to the transmutation plans of Buni and some selected members of the APC caretaker committee.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party would soon be summoned.\n\nA special NEC meeting of the APC in June 2020 had appointed Buni, a former national secretary of the party, as chairman of the caretaker committee following the leadership crisis triggered by the suspension of the then National Chairman of the party, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given a six-month mandate to organise a convention that would elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nBut the committee sought and was granted a six-month extension to complete its mandate.\n\nBut after 12 months in office, no date has been announced for the election of the executive committee members.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Buni-led caretaker committee has begun to plan another meeting of NEC to seek an elongation of its tenure.\n\nA member of the committee that spoke to THISDAY in confidence said there is a plot for the Buni committee to seek an elongation or an outright self-perpetuation of members in office.\n\nThe argument, the source said, would be that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent of Buni, were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that since his emergence as caretaker committee chairman, Buni has not spent up to four days a week in Yobe State as he stays in Abuja most of the time.\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor, he was the national secretary of APC when Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\n\u201cAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know, were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise,\u201d the source said.\n\nSome of the APC members who did not want to be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate themselves in office.\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee has already overstayed its welcome.\n\nA member of the committee also confirmed the self-succession bid, saying: \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, and not this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\n\u201cAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate. If by the next month, there is no date announced for the elections, I will speak out and also resign. What is happening is not our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe were appointed in June 2020 and our mandate was renewed in December to end in June. Any further plan to seek an extension or perpetuate us in office, count me out.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the allegation of self- perpetuation, saying he has no intention to resign his position as the governor of Yobe State to become the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nBuni\u2019s Director of Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, said he already has a job, and he is not looking for another one.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a blatant lie; it is just a fabrication. The governor has a job, which he\u2019s doing and he is not looking for any other job. It is not even worth responding because it does not even get an inch close to anything obtainable with the governor.\n\n\u201cThe task before him is to build a viable and vibrant political party; organise a very successful congress and convention and handover the party to elected officials.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted yesterday on the purported plan to convey NEC meeting of the party to seek further extension, the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut a party source, who pleaded anonymity, told THISDAY that conducting party congresses and convention this month was not feasible, as there is no road map.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president has not agreed with what the caretaker committee is trying to do as regards another elongation. The president is still adamant, he has not said anything. He is waiting for them to convince him.\n\n\u201cIf we want to conduct the congress, it starts from the ward to the local government to the state. It is those who emerge from these congresses that will form the national delegates to the convention. But we have not done any of this and there is no date scheduled for it at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe party source added ward congress will take a week or two, same as local government congresses and state congresses.\n\nHe said there would also be an appeal for ward, local and state congresses which would take two weeks each.\n\nThe source added: \u201cNow we are in Lagos to authenticate the membership register for it to be used for the primary election, which we are in the process. We have done that of Ogun, we are now in Lagos. We have not authenticated that of other states, how do you now expect a congress to come up.\u201d\n\nAsked if the membership register was authenticated by the party officials before the primary, he replied: \u201cThey didn\u2019t use it, they by-passed it. If there is any litigation against them, they will win in court. They didn\u2019t use the approved membership register; they falsified the one they used. Even in Abeokuta, they are falsified.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that there is no way the party can conduct congress without authenticating and finalising the registration of new members.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I have only one passport; there is nowhere I am going. We are here, we cannot continue to gloss over it and talk about what we want to break away from. Even if any breakaway will start, it will end on a table, so, let\u2019s create that table amongst ourselves and start talking.\n\n\u201cIf we understand that there are different strengths in the room, let equity and fairness come into play, let\u2019s understand what are the things you have that is bothering you and what are the things you don\u2019t have that you want to have and let\u2019s be able to resolve it.\n\n\u201cIt is not by saying that we want to go (our separate ways). Oduduwa nation, when they come, they will now realise that even Egba, Ijebu and Ekiti, also want to break away, they will never see an end to that because every clan and every race will also want something and that is where it is difficult.\n\n\u201cThere is strength in number, let us utilise that strength and be able to work for all of us. It is when it is not working and it is perceived as nepotism, that is when people agitate. If we are fair and have a seat for everyone, we can take this country forward. Nobody wants a war. We never know how war will end. Who is going to take us? Over 200 million people? Please, let\u2019s be sincere and be real with ourselves.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu urged the National Assembly to implement the desires of the people in the amendment of 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s commend the leadership of the National Assembly and let us hope that they will take these commendations and this big, bold step to a logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nHe also insisted on fiscal federalism, devolution of power, and restructuring to allow the sub-nationals to function optimally.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is really just too big. Let\u2019s just say it. It\u2019s got over a thousand agencies. It\u2019s big and it really doesn\u2019t have a state; it is still federal.\n\n\u201cLet us know what the sub-nationals can do. The state governments, the local governments, are closer to the people; let them be able to deal with these issues (while the Federal Government) deal with what is uniting all of us \u2013 foreign affairs \u2013 internal security, let\u2019s do it,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not to stand in its way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have the responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe forum warned that attacks and killings of northerners, federal government employees, and destruction of national assets must stop, adding that those involved must be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nThe northern elders also noted that until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, as the federal and state governments have a responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens.\n\nThey also supported the calls for northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence, to consider relocating to the north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey, however, advised that all Igbo and other ethnic groups residing in the north should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.",

          "title": "The best communications managers are empathetic storytellers.",
          "text": "I arrived at Moyosola\u2019s home a few minutes after 9 am last Thursday. Our conversation took place over two plates of half English breakfast, two cups of coffee, and homemade fruit smoothies.\n\nMoyosola Kara is the director of marketing and communications at Eze Wholesale \u2013 a YC-backed startup on a mission to simplify the wholesale electronics trade market. She\u2019s an ambitious straight-shooter who is serious about taking breaks and carving out time to reconnect with herself and the people in her life.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Moyosola to Centre Stage because she\u2019s had an unconventional but rewarding career as a marketing and communications specialist. Her experience working with businesses across multiple industries has equipped her with valuable skills that are needed in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTell me the last good book you read\n\nI just finished Untamed by Glennon Doyle. I also read a really good book by Elaine Welteroth. She was the youngest editor in Conde Nast\u2019s history and the second African American person to be made editor-in-chief at Teen Vogue.\n\nYou have described yourself as a homebody who enjoys the occasional getaway. How are you able to marry your introverted personality with your role as a communications executive?\n\nBeing able to switch into extroverted comms mode provides a nice balance. If I had a job in a quiet little cubicle, I would probably be miserable. I get my fix from my job. I get my fix when I interact and engage with my team, and with customers. Human interaction is very important, especially because we are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nTell me about school. What did you study? Where did you go?\n\nI did not study marketing or communications (surprise surprise). I have a Bachelor of Commerce in Law (BCom Law) and it\u2019s a program that is only offered in South Africa. I started off with studying economics, but after my first year and learning more about what economists did for a living, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to go down that career path.\n\nSo, you changed your degree?\n\nYes, I did \u2013 at the start of my second year. Here\u2019s the truth: initially, I thought I was going to enjoy the law aspect of the program. I mean I enjoyed speaking, had gone through Toastmasters, and being a lawyer seemed like a viable career option. I was wrong. In the end, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer.\n\nWow. How were you able to figure out your career path?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or what kind of career I wanted to pursue. It wasn\u2019t until my time at Elizabeth Arden that I figured out my passion: talking to customers and connecting them to their favourite brands or businesses. When I was in South Africa, Elizabeth Arden was typecast as a beauty brand that catered exclusively to white South African women. Black South African women bought their perfumes, but make-up and skincare? No chance. When Elizabeth Arden was ready to change that image, I became fully immersed in trying to figure out our campaigns and how to speak to this new target audience.\n\nSo you kind of fell into marketing and communications?\n\nBasically. I didn\u2019t realize until years later that what I was doing at Elizabeth Arden was marketing. And I loved it.\n\nHow are you able to wear both hats? Especially because marketing and communications (comms) are two different departments?\n\nMy career in Nigeria started in PR. Then I worked in digital marketing, media, marketing, before finally settling down in a communications role at 54gene. My learnings have prepared me for where I am right now and given me the skills I need to wear both hats effectively well.\n\nHow do you find alignment between the two?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that although they are significantly different, there are parts of marketing and communication that are interwoven. For me, it\u2019s about finding synergy in those interwoven parts. My job is to set key goals and metrics for each department and ensure that we are all working towards achieving them with maximum efficiency. Sometimes, it gets tricky.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, comms is heavy on messaging and storytelling. While marketing is more tactical and strategic with a lot more moving parts. And obviously, because we are in a fast-paced social media and technology age, digital marketing is hot right now and isn\u2019t what it used to be three years ago.\n\nHow are you able to keep up with the changes?\n\nSocial media is my new learning ground. You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you learn on Twitter, Youtube, and Medium. On the marketing side, I follow themarketingtopic on Twitter and I\u2019m also subscribed to Marketing Brew. I also enjoyed reading Clueless To Designer \u2013 it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide to product design written by Mitchelle Chibundu. Mark Manson also writes a newsletter that I\u2019m subscribed to and enjoy reading every now and then.\n\nHow are you applying what you are learning on the job?\n\nMy role at Eze is vastly different from my role at 54gene. With Eze, I\u2019m dealing with markets outside of Africa which means I have to learn how to speak the marketing language for those markets. I have to draw inspiration from marketing leaders who understand what Eze is trying to do in the wholesale ecosystem.\n\nWhat would you say to aspiring and working communications and marketing professionals?\n\nFirstly, prioritize storytelling. Eat, breathe, and live storytelling. Explore how different brands are telling stories and motivating their customers to buy a product or engage with their posts on social media.\n\nSecondly, study consumer behaviour. What is driving people to spend money? What are your customers\u2019 pain points? Who are you selling to?\n\nLastly, invite empathy into your work. Tactics are important but if you don\u2019t know how to connect with your audience on a deeper level, you will lose them to a competitor. A growing number of young buyers are paying attention to businesses that care about promoting social change and impact.\n\nMoyosola\u2019s tip: Empathy and storytelling go hand-in-hand.\n\nWhat does good leadership look like to you?\n\nI believe that leadership is about paying attention to your people. It\u2019s important to be kind, empathetic, and supportive. I think not enough is said about managers who support their team members. You need to move away from just doling out tasks to going over and beyond to arm your team with the tools and resources they need to succeed. I\u2019m dedicated to ensuring that my team members are developing their skill sets and getting access to the training they need.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "title": "Club Swan Creates Services To Address Challenges Faced By Nigerian Entrepreneurs",
          "text": "Abiodun Ajayi \u2013 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Strategist\n\nClub Swan, a global lifestyle club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has launched new services to address challenges faced by Nigerian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nInnovation in payments first came with the advent of paper money to replace bartering. The second wave of innovation continued with the issuance of credit and debit cards. Now, through technology, we are on the third wave of payment innovation: the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nTo provide recent historical context, in the late 1990s, many believed mobile phones were too expensive for a large majority of people in Africa. Lack of infrastructure meant that it was unthinkable to just set up a mobile telecommunications market. However, in 1998, Mo Ibrahim saw an opportunity and developed a business model to meet the needs of Africans. This triggered development across the continent and created thousands of jobs. The telecoms industry in Africa is now worth over $200 billion.\n\nToday, cryptocurrency has initiated an entrepreneurial boom in Nigeria. A report by Chain Analysis showed that in 2020, Nigeria ranked first among African countries in peer-to-peer payments. Up to $139 million was traded in peer-to-peer payments in 2020 according to the report.\n\nCryptocurrency activity in Africa.\n\nThe basis of this adoption is the need for viable alternatives to challenges we face in global payments.\n\nNigeria has become a hotbed for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and has unleashed a vibrant crypto and blockchain community alongside a teeming population of digitally native youth who are unabashedly united to participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\nTo a large extent, the situations we see in Nigeria are indicative of the trends occurring generally in sub-Saharan Africa. Simply put, there is a wave of enlightenment and Nigerians are willing to test and figure out new ways of doing things facilitated by technology.\n\nWhen oil revenue plunged in 2020, a dollar shortage ensued which devalued the Naira. As of March 2021, the inflation rate in Nigeria hovered around 18%. Aspiring business leaders are now dealing with the fact that current financial options available simply can\u2019t keep up with inflation. Hence, many entrepreneurs have turned to crypto as a viable option.\n\nChallenges faced by Nigerian entrepreneurs\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce International Settlements\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce\n\nCryptocurrency allows entrepreneurs to transfer and receive money from anywhere worldwide. However, some face undue obstacles when payment firms place limits on Nigerians.\n\nCrypto has enabled Tola Fadugbagbe, a businessman who moved to Lagos 10 years ago to grow his business. Today, he sources his mobile phones from east Asia and he finds it easier to make payments to his east Asian partners in bitcoin.\n\nCrypto has created a paradigm shift in the way people start to think about emerging markets and creating new business opportunities. The success of cryptocurrency can be attributed to the fact that business owners need alternative ways to conduct trade in a seamless fashion.\n\nInternational Settlements\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have made it possible for individuals to conduct business virtually without any intermediaries, thereby enabling companies worldwide to reach out to customers across international borders. In the past few years, merchants have leveraged for cross-border payments. According to Lagos vendor Abolaji Odunjo, \u201cmaking payments with Bitcoin makes transactions easier and reduces costs.\u201d\n\nCrypto advantages for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nExpanded payments opportunities\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, payment for goods and services has been ever present. However, it has gone through innovation over the years. From the earliest exchange of goods by barter to the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith crypto, there are expanded payment opportunities. This makes transactions easier and more efficient.\n\nTrusted transactions\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain which is publicly accessible and transparent. The transactions are relatively secure and fast.\n\nWe Nigerians know, the quickest way to build trust is to give customers the quickest response time as we prefer quick service delivery. The entrepreneur or business owner that can provide the shortest time between when the customer makes payment and when the customer receives value ultimately wins the heart of the customer.\n\nDisadvantages of crypto for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nNo reliable methods to off-ramp large amounts of crypto to fiat\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to large funds of $2000 and above, only one reliable service is available to Nigerians.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s broadcast regulator, National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), has ordered all broadcasting stations to deactivate their Twitter handles. In addition, the body further prohibits media platforms from using User Generated Content (UGC) as sources in their reportage.\n\nThe statement calls for strict compliance citing lines from the NBC Act and The Broadcasting Code that point to media companies having an obligation to adhere to national laws and be mindful of content capable of inciting violence or public unrest.\n\nAlthough not outrightly stated, defaulters could be penalised based on the federation\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s order to prosecute any Nigerian still using the microblogging platform.\n\nThe latest order resulting from the ongoing Twitter suspension in the country since Friday, June 4, 2021, is a way of disincentivising individuals and corporate bodies from patronising Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this proves to be a challenging period for businesses strongly dependent on the social media platform.\n\nWhile the statement does not clearly state what media platforms are affected by the directive, the NBC Act defines broadcasting stations as entities \u2014 like radio, sound, television, cable, or satellite stations \u2014 that have received a broadcasting licence after satisfying the regulator\u2019s requirements. From the definition, it is not clear if new media companies are also caught in this web.\n\nThis is not the first time the NBC is clamping down on broadcasters in the country.\n\nRecall, during the October 2020 #EndSARS protest, NBC suspended three media companies on the claims of using UGC as their sources while accusing them of misinformation and releasing content that could incite unrest.\n\nIn a previous article, we established the role that UGC has played in the past in Nigeria while questioning why it should be forbidden because of the October 20, 2020 Lekki Tollgate Massacre.\n\nFollowing the Twitter suspension order, some digital platforms have disengaged themselves from receiving customer complaints via their Twitter handles, advising users to reach out through other channels; others have put up disclaimer posts about where they are tweeting from.\n\nFor one, recent events have pointed to the intensified drive of the federal government to inhibit free speech, one of the many signs that the country may gradually be borrowing China\u2019s cards.\n\nAs Twitter users in Nigeria find alternatives to access the platform either through VPN and other channels, it remains to be seen how this would ultimately impact journalism, freedom of speech, and timely dissemination of information in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Nigeria has finally joined the list of countries losing millions of dollars to government-led Internet crackdowns annually.

          "title": "#TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision",
          "text": "It is no longer news that the Nigerian government has indefinitely banned Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Friday, June 4, 2021. He also revealed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to begin the process of licensing over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) instruct telcos to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nIn another statement released on Saturday, June 5, 2021, Garba Shehu, the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, cited the platform\u2019s role in disseminating false information and fake news as the rationale behind the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also advised disregarding the notion that the ban is a knee-jerk reaction to the deletion of a tweet made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe tweet in question, which referred to the Nigerian Civil War, was removed by Twitter for violating its policy on referencing mass murders, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have been the targets or victims.\n\nThis is not the first time the government has attempted Internet censorship. It had gone the expected legislative route in 2019 with the \u201csocial media bill\u201d, which was outrightly rejected by Nigerians.\n\nThe bill is officially titled \u201cProtection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019\u201d and prescribes a \u20a6300,000 ($730) fine or a jail term of up to three years for persons spreading false information or that which could affect the nation\u2019s security and relationship with other countries.\n\nBecause it was perceived to be a gag on citizen\u2019s right to freedom of expression as enshrined in the Constitution, it received a lot of backlash from the Nigerian public. As of press time, the bill has not progressed further than the second reading stage.\n\nSo far, discussions on Techpoint Africa have focused on the economic impact, a possible Internet firewall, and security issues arising from the use of VPN. However, this discourse will analyse the legal issues surrounding the government\u2019s decision.\n\nOur chat with three lawyers \u2014 Co-founder, Tech-Hive Advisory, Ridwan Oloyede; Lead Advisor, Lawrathon, Enyioma Madubuike; and Tech Lawyer and Policy Consultant, Timi Olagunju, \u2014 is detailed below.\n\nIs the ban legal?\n\nAll three lawyers agree that the ban is illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the ban is \u201can attack and suppression of the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution and other international human right norms that Nigeria is a party to.\u201d\n\nThis right to freedom of expression as contained in Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) provides for freedom to hold an opinion and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\n\nA 2016 United Nations (UN) resolution on the promotion, protection, and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet guarantees the protection of human rights \u2014 particularly, freedom of expression \u2014 offline and online. A resolution confirmed by Oloyede to have been supported by Nigeria.\n\nOther international treaties which expressly provide for this right include the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all of which Nigeria is a party to.\n\nTo put all of this in context, the Constitution is regarded as the \u201cgrundnorm\u201d of all laws in Nigeria. The law from which all other laws, policies, regulations, and guidelines draw their legality. If any of these in any way deviate from the spirit of the Constitution, it cannot stand.\n\nAs Olagunju puts it, these international treaties/conventions are meant to promote rather than restrict this right. The only condition for restriction is where it is expressly provided for by law or as a matter of national security, public order, or the reputation of others. This is also contained in Section 45 of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the conditions for derogating from human rights under the constitution were not met.\n\n\u201cAn executive decision cannot be considered a law reasonably justified in a democratic society. As we speak, there is no legislation from the National Assembly prohibiting the use.\u201d\n\nAs Madubuike puts it, \u201cThere are processes provided for actions that would impact citizens\u2019 rights; this unilateral action has been done without any due process. None.\u201d\n\nOther aspects to consider under this heading involve the declaration made by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, which effectively orders the prosecution of anyone found using Twitter.\n\nNigerian law clearly states that no one can be prosecuted for a crime that is unknown to law.\n\nAccording to Madubuike, \u201cTweeting is not a crime. The fact that a minister says otherwise does not make it so. Crimes are created by specific laws made by lawmakers, not by declaration of a Minister. We are still a constitutional democracy despite all appearances otherwise.\u201d\n\nNBC, Ministry of Information and Culture, and its powers\n\nThe NBC, by virtue of its establishing Act, has regulatory powers in respect of broadcasting. This means that its purview is in relation to television and radio companies. This places the Commission under the aegis of the Ministry of Information and Culture, headed by Mohammed.\n\nTherefore, in the context of Mohammed\u2019s proclamation, it seems he may have overstepped his bounds\n\nOlagunju attributes the powers exercised by the MInister as likely being under the umbrella of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) as an agency with an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework under the purview of the Ministry for Communication and Digital Economy.\n\nHe also says that the directive regarding OTT and social media licences might be a back door to enacting the social media bill, which must be looked at in light of the National Assembly\u2019s oversight powers in that regard.\n\nOther legal issues which have been raised include the use of videos and pictures gotten from Twitter as evidence in court. Both Oloyede and Olagunju agree that the Evidence Act of Nigeria is more concerned with the relevance of the evidence rather than its source.\n\nThus, a defense of a Twitter ban in such a scenario would not suffice.\n\nWhat we may have to worry about is the Judiciary\u2019s role and independence. Ordinarily, Nigeria practises the doctrine of separation of powers which, as Oloyede explains, means the Executive, Judiciary, and Legislature are independent bodies.\n\nSeveral organisations such as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) have made known their intentions to contend the legality of the ban in court.\n\nWhile we know the ban is illegal, it is now up to the courts to give a decision.",

          "title": "#TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?",
          "text": "Following the announcement of the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria on Friday, June 4, 2021, Twitter users in the country have opted for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass the ban.\n\nA VPN allows individuals to protect sensitive information by securing a public connection to a private network. Any data that passes through a VPN is converted into a code to prevent unauthorised access. This protects users against probable hacking attacks or theft of crucial data.\n\nWhile the government and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can monitor daily online activities and restrict the websites or apps that Internet subscribers can visit or access, a VPN can provide security solutions that restore online privacy and liberty.\n\nWith a VPN, you can easily browse the Internet without worrying about restrictions, monitoring, or tracking done by the ISPs, government, or even third parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, while the adoption of VPNs might be a quick solution for users to bypass the Twitter ban, some of these free VPNs are not safe enough to protect or keep users\u2019 data private because they compromise their security.\n\nResearch by the ICSI Networking and Security Group found that 38% of the 283 Android VPNs studied contained malware.\n\nAccording to Fortinet \u2014 an American cybersecurity company \u2014 this malware could be used by cybercriminals to steal users\u2019 data, gain unauthorised access to their data or machine, or launch a cyberattack.\n\nIn 2020, according to research by Nord VPN, seven free VPN providers \u2014 UFO VPN, FAST VPN, Super VPN, Free VPN, Flash VPN, Secure VPN, and Rabbit VPN \u2014 in Hong-Kong exposed 1.2 terabytes of data collected from millions of users who trusted them with their logs even though they claimed to offer no-log policies.\n\nUsers\u2019 data containing sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, emails, home addresses, and passwords were unprotected and publicly made available.\n\nLike the ISPs and the government, some free VPNs track their users\u2019 online activities. The ICSI research discovered that 72% of the free VPN services analysed embedded third-party tracking tools in their software.\n\nThis permits these VPNs to sell the information they collect to third parties and allows advertisers to target users.\n\nSome free VPNs conceal information about sharing or selling user data, but others disclose it in their privacy policies. But how many people read privacy policies before accepting them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFree VPNs are not free because they money rise their operations in other ways. To make revenue, they either sell users\u2019 data to third parties or flood you with ads without your permission.\n\nThe adage then comes to mind, if you are not paying for the product, you are the product.\n\nWhile paid VPNs have ad-blocking tools, malware protection features, and unlimited bandwidth that secure users\u2019 data, free VPNs have a smaller infrastructure, leading to slower Internet speeds.\n\nIn times like the Twitter ban, VPN services might be a solution. However, users must carefully choose what country they connect with because VPNs are illegal in some countries.\n\nTherefore, do your research to ensure your connection is not established in countries like Russia, Uganda, Turkey, and China, amongst others.\n\nUsing a paid VPN will cost you more money than your data subscription. Still, there are affordable paid VPNs that you can access individually or as a family.\n\nComparitech advises that before choosing a paid VPN, look for a provider that actively prevents IP address disclosures. Also, ensure it does not collect log data that users share on it.\n\nLook for a provider that has a VPN kill switch feature. This helps users exit specific programs if an Internet connection fluctuates, reducing the risk of sensitive data being disclosed.\n\nFinally, ensure the VPN you are selecting supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This ensures that only authorised users can gain access to it.\n\nThe VPN might be a temporary solution as the Federal Government, on Saturday, June 5, 2021, reportedly reached out to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) to discuss plans to build an Internet firewall.\n\nThe Internet firewall, if built, would allow the government to block VPNs. This means that Twitter might not be accessible via some free VPNs.\n\nWhile social media has been a tool for free speech and expression, in 2019, the government introduced the hate speech and social media bills to control the right to speech and expression online.\n\nAlthough the social media bill was brought up again in 2020 due to the #EndSARS protests, with the Twitter ban, it looks like it is already being implemented.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the government is planning. However, we know that VPNs are temporary solutions to the Twitter ban, and some free VPNs do not guarantee security and privacy.",
          "summary": "The ICSI research discovered that 72% of the free VPN services analysed embedded third-party tracking tools in their software.\nSome free VPNs conceal information about sharing or selling user data, but others disclose it in their privacy policies.\nTo make revenue, they either sell users\u2019 data to third parties or flood you with ads without your permission.\nWhile paid VPNs have ad-blocking tools, malware protection features, and unlimited bandwidth that secure users\u2019 data, free VPNs have a smaller infrastructure, leading to slower Internet speeds.\nHowever, we know that VPNs are temporary solutions to the Twitter ban, and some free VPNs do not guarantee security and privacy.",

The institution has an amazing manpower; if you talk about the Law School, at one time, all the prize winners were from AAU. Or is it the engineering profession? You can go on and on, because the institution has produced amazing people.\n\n\u201cWhat you have today in AAU is unacceptable; a situation where you have an association of Esan Professors and those of Afemai Professors in an ivory tower. They have run that school aground.\n\n\u201cThe university has been divided down the line; it is like the school is just there for the workers, not the students.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSo, as a government, we have decided that AAU must be restructured. AAU is Edo State university; it is not a local university. We must restructure it to meet universal standards. Ambrose Alli\u2019s dream was to make it an internationally-recognized university and that is my dream.\n\n\u201cCan any foreign university come to partner with us like this? So, I have to prepare the school to be an international university, which Ambrose Alli meant it to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleading for your support for the sake of our children and for the sake of our future. Please, join me; support me, so that we can clean up AAU, because what it has done and what it can do for Esan land and the entire Edo Central Senatorial District, you cannot imagine,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, former Minister of Works, Mr. Mike Onolememen, assured the governor that the entire Esan people are fully in his support.\n\n...",

In addition to all the receipts, they incurred debt of more than N10 billion; I want to find out what happened.\n\n\u201cWe are operating a system that is not working anymore and we all must agree to change it because we are all involved. We can only deliver services to our people only if we agree moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe must clean up the local government system knowing that elections will soon take us back to the people who will ask us about our electoral promises. The clean-up is necessary to enable us to deliver services to our people.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well we perform in the state, the local government is closest to the people. If the local government does not work, it will be difficult for us to show what we have achieved. What happens at the local government level affects the people.\n\n\u201cWhen the term of the past local government administration started, we knew that we had to undertake some changes. We sought people with integrity and experience to take charge of the local government. We know what happened during the political season.\u201d\n\nHinting on his government\u2019s backing for local government autonomy, the governor noted: \u201cI have come to realise that there are structural problems in the local government. We don\u2019t take money or touch the local government\u2019s money. We are transparent and open as we don\u2019t interfere in the local government\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIf you want me to publish the amount that accrues to local governments monthly, I will do that to ensure transparency in the incoming administration. Moving forward, I will hold local government leaders responsible for any mismanagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to fulfilling our promises to the people of the state. We must fix the engine of government, make it work more effectively and ensure development in the local government areas,\u201d he reassured.\n\nThe governor further charged local governments not to rely on monthly federal allocation but to be innovative and come up with better means of improving their revenue.\n\nObaseki stated: \u201cThe money is not there again as it used to be. The dependence of money from Abuja is not possible anymore, that is why I am insisting and emphasising local government reforms.\n\n\u201c70 to 80 percent of finance for local governments comes from Abuja and there will be problems if the money stops coming. We will not and can\u2019t continue like this. You will help me to stop people from collecting revenue and putting it in their private pockets. We have enough resources to keep us going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must bring the leadership together and agree on the way forward as this is the only way to solve the problem faced by the State,\u201d he said.\n\nA leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Igueben Local Government Area, Chief Felix Omi Imoisili said, \u201cWe will collaborate with you in the reforms you are embarking on at the local government level.

          "text": "In a moment of anger and lack of critical reflection unbecoming of a democratically elected government, and with complete disregard to our rights, the Buhari Administration on June 4 announced an indefinite ban on the operations of \u201cthe microblogging and social networking service, Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSegun Adeyemi, Special Assistant To The President (Media) in the office of the Minister of Information and Culture, Abuja, claimed in a terse press release that the Minister, Lai Mohammed, attributed the ban to: \u201cThe persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d.\n\nMr Adeyemi stated further that the \u201cFederal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nTaking a cue from the Information and Culture Minister, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, also threatened that Nigerians who defy the Twitter ban would be prosecuted.\n\nThe argument advanced in Adeyemi\u2019s press release notwithstanding, Nigerians are not oblivious of the real reason why the rash decision was taken \u2013 the taking down of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Twitter handle for tweeting what was interpreted as a threat of genocide or bloody suppression against a section of the Nigerian populace.\n\nThe president had tweeted: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nIt is common knowledge that social media service providers like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, among others, have well defined and widely disseminated industry standards that frown at the use of words and expressions that convey hateful messages or thoughts. Thus, with his handle temporarily suspended from the Twitter space, President Buhari has company in former President of the United States, Donald Trump, who received a similar knock when he repeatedly tweeted venomous messages against American citizens opposed to his indecorous approach to addressing governance and political issues.\n\nOf poetic irony is the fact that one issue over which the Buhari Administration has repeatedly waxed lyrical is that of hate speech; so much that the National Assembly, controlled by his All Progressives Peoples Congress (APC), has introduced a bill to establish the National Hate Speech Commission and another one to regulate the social media. Both bills have rightly been opposed by Nigerians who feared that they would serve as witch-hunt apparatuses against those who exercise the right of dissent. Events around the Twitter ban have confirmed the fear of the civil society, media outlets and groups, professional bodies, etc., in this regard.\n\nWe condemn the ban on Twitter in Nigeria on a number of fundamental grounds.\n\nFirst, the ban constitutes a gross abuse of office, as it elevates the personal interest of the President above that of the country and her citizens. The President is indeed NOT the state and disagreements over the personal terms he voluntarily entered with Twitter should not be allowed to threaten the public and national interest. Moreover, we are not aware of any law of the federation that allows the President or a Minister to whimsically deny Nigerians access to social media services of their choice.\n\nSecondly, the ban is a grave violation of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which the trio of the President, the Minister of Information and the Minister of Justice swore to uphold. By infringing citizens\u2019 fundamental right to the freedom of expression and association, it violates section 39 of the Constitution, while undermining the social and economic rights guaranteed Nigerian citizens by Chapter 11 of the Constitution.\n\nThirdly, the ban is a violation of and assault on a number of international, continental and regional instruments that Nigeria willingly subscribes to. Indeed, the ban clearly falls below their expectations of the realm of the rights and freedom that citizens should freely enjoy.\n\nAmong these are the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the Universal Declaration of Peoples and Human Rights. Pursuant to the provisions of the African Charter, Resolution 362 of 2016 of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights expressed concern at the practice by State Parties to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, of \u201cinterrupting or limiting access to telecommunication services such as the Internet, social media and messaging services.\u201d\n\nIn specific terms, the African Commission adopted the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Principle 38 (1) and (2) of which states that, \u201cStates shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receive and impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\u201d And that \u201cStates shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to the internet and other digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\u201d\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council also has a subsisting resolution of July 2018 that demands the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet.\n\nFourthly, the ban constitutes an unwarranted attack on the corporate, business and professional interests of organisations and individuals legitimately managing their affairs on Twitter, including but not limited to the media, entrepreneurs, researchers, educational institutions, NGOs and CCSOs. As at the third quarter of 2020, Twitter accounted for 61.4 per cent of Internet users in Nigeria, coming after WhatsApp and Facebook messenger, according to \u2018Statista\u2019, while \u2018Quora\u2019 estimates the number to be about seven million. Even if the number of users is considerably less, it still does not justify a ban that is jeopardising the means of business and social communication of citizens.\n\nFifthly, the ban further underscores the investor community\u2019s growing concern over the unpredictability of the domestic policy environment. The consequences of a subsequent attenuation of investment for an economy whose recovery from the initial stages of the pandemic has been described as \u201cfragile\u201d are better imagined.\n\nIn general, only a government that wants to shut itself from its own citizens would take the kind of bizarre step of banning a social media platform. If anything, Minister Malami\u2019s added threat of prosecuting those who circumvent or defy the ban would only invite more opprobrium for the government, both at home and abroad. This is why it is necessary to remind the Minister that the laws of the Federation do not give him such powers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis riot of contradictions suggest that the directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) \u201cto immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria,\u201d is nothing but an attempt to smuggle in through the backdoor, the Social Media Bill, which Nigerians have roundly rejected. Unsurprisingly, many believe that the present Twitter ban by the government is a poorly concealed dress rehearsal for the full censorship of all OTTs (including YouTube, Facebook, etc.) and social media operations in Nigeria. It is in this context that we draw attention to recent reports that the Federal Government is engaged with the Chinese authorities to build an internet firewall in Nigeria so the government can easily block any organ they want.\n\nWhile we have no doubt that Nigerians will struggle and stop this creeping dictatorship, PREMIUM TIMES calls on Nigerians to rise up, contest and stop this blatant attack on our rights. No regime has succeeded in silencing the voices of Nigerians because we have not allowed it. This regime too will fail in this scandalous attempt to deprive us of our rights.",

          "title": "CBN gas policy holds out promise for domestic market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is high optimism among Oil and gas experts and economic analysts that the target of expanding gas consumption in Nigeria would be substantially achieved with appropriate deployment of the N250bn gas intervention fund set aside by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe use of cooking gas in Nigeria increased to one million metric tonnes in 2020 from about 400MT consumption level recorded four years ago. But operators attribute the increase to the removal of the subsidy on kerosene, noting that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration was still far from the national target of five million metric tonnes set for next year.\n\nIt is no longer debatable that Nigeria is endowed with enormous natural gas resource. However, how to use this resource to develop and transform the nation\u2019s economy and add significant value to the lives of its citizens remains a major issue for decades.\n\nAccording to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013the regulator of activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as at January 2020, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stood at 203.16trillion cubic feet. The nation\u2019s unproven gas reserve is still at about 600trillion cubic feet. These numbers no doubt put Nigeria as a major player in the world gas market, ranking as the ninth largest gas producer globally and the number one on the African continent.\n\nFor long, there have been conversations around how Nigeria can leverage the vast opportunities in its gas resource to open up the country for investments, which will in turn lead to massive job creation, enhanced energy efficiency, increased productivity as well as increased revenue to both government and businesses.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria prides itself as a major exporter of LNG to the world via the Nigeria LNG Limited, making gas available for domestic use through business-friendly government policies and actions will help a great deal in driving economic diversification and competition.\n\nPlayers in the country\u2019s gas sector are of the view that there is no better time to optimise the potential of the gas resources than now that the whole world is struggling to survive the impact of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo them, the pandemic and its attendant economic turmoil has presented an opportunity for the country to look inward by prioritising in-country utilisation of the abundant gas resources. They believe there should be increased attention to the development of gas infrastructure in Nigeria and the deepening of domestic consumption and utilisation of the commodity in order to boost the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, despite the abundant gas potential, Nigeria still struggles to develop and grow its economy, a situation that makes jest of the country at the international front.\n\n\u201cNigeria does represent quite an interesting paradox. We are major resource holders, major exporter of gas, at the same time we struggle on the domestic front with de-industrialization, with unmet domestic gas demand and insufficiency in gas supply to the power sector for power generation,\u201d President of the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Mrs Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, once said.\n\nCBN to the rescue\n\nIn order to make Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes, the federal government introduced the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP). Under the NGEP, the CBN is providing N250 billion loan to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain as part of its efforts to stimulate finance to critical sectors of the economy.\n\nIn a guideline titled \u2018Framework for the implementation of intervention facility for the national gas expansion programme\u2019, CBN set N10bn as the maximum loan an obligor can access under its N250bn intervention fund for the gas sector.\n\nPart of the term loan conditions for manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, was that the term loan, \u201cShall be determined based on the activity and shall not exceed N10bn per obligor. Working capital is maximum of N500m per obligor.\u201d\n\nIt said the objectives of the facility included improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain; and also to stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nThe facility, the apex bank said, also aimed to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nIt would also fast-track the development of gas-based industries particularly petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) to support large industries, such as agriculture, textile, and related industries; provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market; and boost employment across the country.\n\nEligible activities under the intervention include establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants; establishment of gas cylinder manufacturing plants; establishment of L-CNG regasification modular systems; and establishment of auto gas conversion kits or components manufacturing plants.\n\nOthers are establishment of CNG primary and secondary compression stations; establishment and manufacturing of LPG retail skid tanks and refilling equipment; development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure; and enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets.\n\nIt also involves the establishment/expansion of micro distribution outlets and service centres for LPG sales, domestic cylinder injection and exchange; and any other mid to downstream gas value chain related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe intervention fund by CBN is a welcome development because it will not only support in deepening the consumption of gas but will help ameliorate sicknesses caused by the use of firewood,\u201d an economic analyst with interest in public health, Mr. Bath Onwuachu, told our correspondent.\n\nHe urged operators in the gas industry to take advantage of the fund to further expand the sector and increase the penetration of gas consumption. According to Onwuachu, deepening of gas usage would reduce the rate of deforestation, a development that would impact positively on the environment.\n\nMr. Lambert Ojo, a gas processing and evaporative cooling specialist, believes the intervention for local investors in the gas sector would stimulate the economy. He, however, called for a transparent and seamless process when obtaining the facility from the apex bank in order to encourage industry players.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to do in the domestic gas space. What is happening internationally in the near future should not affect us because there\u2019s a lot we can do with our resource,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Ahmed Bobboi, stated that PEF was aligning with the CBN and the federal government to further deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria. He said to achieve this, the agency was planning to equalise gas price so as to ensure that more citizens had access to gas.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\u201d",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state, Premium Times reported.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.\n\nCredit: Premium Times",

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu gets list of abandoned buildings, havens for criminals, set to...",
          "text": "*Criminals will find no space in state, governor warns\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said on Monday that a long list of abandoned buildings across Local Government Areas (LGAs) and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs), which may serve as safe haven for criminals, has been compiled.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the state government would be taking proactive action towards ensuring that the buildings do not become security threats in communities where they have been found.\n\nThe popular thinking is that such buildings are occupied by criminals who use them to plan attacks. The government plans to take control of such buildings.\n\nSanwo- Olu spoke of the development during a live interview on Arise TV, where he shared details of his administration\u2019s achievements in the last two years. Sanwo-Olu was 731 days in office on May 29.\n\nAt a consultative meeting on security held last month, participants requested the Government to take control of uncompleted buildings and abandoned vehicles to boost security.\n\nThe Governor, who spoke against the background of rising spate of kidnapping and criminalities in some States across the nation, said the State Government remained at alert to prevent the spillover of criminalities from neighbouring States into Lagos.\n\nTo this, he said his administration was on the verge of recruiting additional 1,500 men into the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) to boost intelligence gathering in local communities and aid security agencies to quickly respond to crimes.\n\nHe said Lagos, in the last six months, had collaborated with the police to strengthen community policing in addressing localised crimes and checking activities of cultists. The State gave the police 1,250 men from the state\u2019s Neighborhood Watch.\n\nHe stressed that the strategy would be effective if residents remained vigilant and offered information on strange activities in their neighbourhoods.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo days ago, I receive report of abandoned buildings across the State from Neighbourhood Watch.\n\nThe list is about 250 pages with addresses and pictures of the buildings. These are some of the places where the criminals and miscreants hide to launch their activities.\n\nWe are passing this list to the security for immediate response and actions. This surveillance speaks to the necessity of state police.\n\nAll the preventable criminalities happening are because we have not agreed as a nation that there should be state police.\n\n\u201cWe have been an advocate of state police and it is one of the submissions I made at the recent public hearing on constitutional amendment in Lagos. State police is a force whose time has come.\n\nWhether it is Amotekun or Neighbourhood Watch, these are all pointers to the necessity of States to have police to make them stronger. All the kidnapping and killings we have been witnessing can be nipped in the bud.\n\nOur challenge in Lagos is not having forests where kidnappers hide; it is more about cultism. I need to think global but localise my response to these challenges.\u201d\n\nOn whether the State would ban commercial motorcycles, popularly known as Okada, Sanwo-Olu said the Government was providing an alternative to the motorcycles with the First and Last Mile minibuses; thousands of them will be pushed into the system.\n\nThe Governor, however, disclosed that transport unions had reached out to the State Government on regularisation of informal transport services, including Okada.\n\nHe said efforts were underway to leverage biometric data for approval of commercial motorcycle operation in areas where it had not been proscribed.\n\nOn the recent progress recorded by the State in its response to infectious diseases, Sanwo-Olu revealed that Lagos now has the capacity to detect new variants of Coronavirus (COVID-19), given procurement of latest PCR machine.\n\nThis, he said, came ahead of the move by the State to build a world-class Infectious Disease Centre in Yaba to support research for diagnosis and treatment of contagious diseases in future.\n\nSharing his opinion on the suspension micro-blogging site, Twitter, by the Federal Government, Sanwo-Olu said: \u201cMr. President, who is the Commanderin-Chief, may have some security information, which I do not have as a sitting Governor.\n\nI won\u2019t say what the Federal Government or Twitter has done is right or wrong. What I see is that, on both sides, there are issues that can be resolved.\n\n\u201cSo, in this period of suspension, let us sit and have a conversation. Had it been Twitter has an office in Nigeria, issues would have been resolved a lot quicker.\n\nIn other climes, Twitter signs agreements on the rule of engagement. I don\u2019t think that has happened here.\n\nThe Federal Government, I believe, can handle the issue a lot better, because of the number of e-commerce firms and youths that are engaging in digital stuff.\n\n\u201cI believe there should be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides. I\u2019ll plead that both sides come together in next one or two days and resolve this. We should not politicise this issue.\n\nPeople are losing money and economies are being destroyed, but there are also security issues. I am ready to give quality advice on what needs to be done if I\u2019m called upon.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said the repeal of Pension Act for former Lagos Governors and military administrators was a popular action taken by his administration to cut spending and improve good governance.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for any pension for ex-Governors in Lagos. I won\u2019t be earning any pension after my tenure,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has spoken of the need to create better synergy among the three services of the armed forces for the ongoing war on insecurity to be won.\n\nBuhari spoke on Monday when he received the new Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Farouk Yahaya, who was in the Presidential Villa with the Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd.), on an introduction visit.\n\nRelating part of the conversation between the President and the new Chief of Army Staff in an interview with NTA after the meeting, Magashi said Buhari also learnt new tips on how to win the protracted war on insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Minister said: \u201cPresident Buhari made sure he pointed out to Yahaya that the nation\u2019s security has been under serious pressure, but he (Magashi), on his part assured Nigerians that a lot is about to change with security operations in the country.\n\n\u201cHe told him that there\u2019s a lot of pressure on security and being an actor, at one point or the other has given us a direction in which we can learn from his experiences and apply them to our modern operations and I think we have taken the advice seriously.\n\n\u201cThe issue of synergy among the security forces was also stressed and I\u2019m sure there will be a lot of changes as regards to the security operations in this country.\n\n\u201cThe President received us, offered some advice on how we can go about doing this operation and the entire security of the country. We assured him that we will do our best to bring an end to the problem of insecurity in this country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very happy; he thanked Mr. President for giving him the opportunity to serve as the Chief of Army Staff and promised that he will bring all his experiences to bear in collaboration with his colleagues; Chief of Air Staff, the Chief of Naval Staff, to be able to do this country proud.\n\n\u201cThe President really has confidence in the new set of people that he has appointed. We wish them the best of luck.\u201d\n\nAsked about what the armed forces are doing to restore peace to the Northwest region, Magashi pointed out that the armed forces have just been rendering a supporting role to the police, which is constitutionally saddled with the responsibility of keeping civil peace.\n\nHe said the main concern of the forces is the terror activities mutating in the Northeast, categorically noting the growing concern with the activities of the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP).\n\n\u201cIn the Northwestern part of the country, you know that the more concern we have is the insecurity of banditry, kidnapping, and other criminalities.\n\nWe are taking the challenge, but you know, really, this is the constitutional responsibility of the police, we are only an aid to the police and we are giving maximum cooperation to the police in order to see an end to this banditry and insecurity in the Northwest, otherwise, I think it\u2019s quite different from the Northeast.\n\n\u201cIn the Northeast, it is Boko Haram issue and we\u2019re up and doing to ensure that we bring an end to this Boko Haram issue, especially with this development of ISWAP,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "If Igbo want to secede, let no one stop them: Statement by Northern Elders",
          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum spoke today on the agitations for secession by Igbo people and advised the authorities not to stand on their way.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way\u201d, said the Forum in a statement signed by Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, its publicity secretary.\n\nBut the Forum also warned Igbo it will not be their best choice to leave a country \u201cwe have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria\u201d, the statement added.\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum also noted the weakening of political and coercive authority in the country, such that the Buhari administration \u201cappears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy\u201d.\n\nRead the Full statement\n\nNorthern Elders Forum has reviewed of events and tendencies which suggest that the country is headed for more crises. Nigerians live in fear of violence today, and in fear of uncertain future. The capacity of the Nigerian State to secure citizens, protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity and resist violent assaults on our unity is weakening to the levels of making threats that have no impact. Armed criminals of all types have increased their audacious stranglehold over our lives in all parts of the country. Irredentists are increasingly asserting their influence over in the South East and some part of the country, and in the manner that millions of Nigerians now live. Rhetorics from political leaders and ethnic champions who speak in threats and demands routinely suggest that the sentiments in support of irredentism are becoming more widespread.\n\nAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN. Muted voices of millions of Igbo cannot be heard so that fellow Nigerians could understand the degree to which secession by the Igbo represents the popular choice.\n\nAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN.\n\nThis nation has had to fight a terrible war to preserve the country. The North had paid its dues in that war, as indeed it did in many ways throughout the history of the country. Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together. The North in particular has more than enough challenges, and we recognize that violent secession by any part of Nigeria will compound the problems all Nigerians live with.\n\nThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way. It will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\n\nThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted. Until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it. We support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North.\n\nUnlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\n\nThe Forum believes that it is vital to address amendments to the constitution and achieve major changes in the structure and operations of our Federal system now. Members of the National Assembly elected by Nigerians have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. This explains the major distances which exist between the people and the vital national institution which should play a major role mitigating national crises. The National Assembly should explore additional avenues for tapping into opinions that can help redress serious limitations to the Federal system before the 2023 elections. The North is willing to discuss all matters related to constitutional amendments/ restructuring with the leadership of the country and other groups who see their presence in the future of Nigeria.\n\nDr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed\n\nDirector, Publicity and Advocacy,\n\nNorthern Elders Forum,\n\nAbuja.",

          "text": "The federal government has said the operations of Twitter in Nigeria will be restored only when \u201cresponsible communication\u201d can be assured on the platform.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama made the position known after a meeting with some envoys Monday in Abuja.\n\nTwitter had deleted a controversial civil war tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari saying it went against their rules.\n\nConsequently, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension of Twitter in the country, citing the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate interest\u201d.\n\nThough mobile operators have blocked their customers in the country from using Twitter, many Nigerians adopted the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access the platform.\n\nOnyeama on condition\n\nSpeaking on how the Twitter service could be restored in the country, the foreign affairs minister, Mr Onyeama said while there is no definite timeline for this, \u201cthe condition (for lifting the suspension) would be responsible use of social media and that really has to be it. When you have the power to communicate, it has to come with responsibilities.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that Twitter is threatening the country or any such thing; why we have taken this measure is to stop them from being used as platforms for destabilisation and facilitation of criminality or encouragement of criminalities,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added that this decision was key to maintaining security in the country, because \u201cwithout security, everything else fails. We will all be losers. What we do today will define the future of the country.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had Friday suspended the operations of Twitter in the country after the social media platform deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari which it deemed as inciting violence.\n\nThe government claimed that the suspension of Twitter was to protect the sovereignty of the country, but digital rights advocates said it was censorship.\n\nDespite public outcry and international condemnations, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) doubled down on the crackdown saying violators of the directive risked being charged to court.\n\nWhile he could not cite the law which these alleged defaulters would be breaching, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation would later direct television and radio stations to deactivate their Twitter handles.\n\nAmid this, the envoys of the U.S., UK, Canada and the European Union, issued a joint statement to condemn the Nigerian government\u2019s crackdown on Twitter, prompting the government to summon the envoys for a behind-closed-door parley.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Mr Onyeama said the Buhari administration was committed to protecting the lives and properties of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNigerian lives matter and we have to do everything we can to preserve Nigerian lives. And when we feel our goals are threatened, actions need to be taken.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to see to what extent this media can be a force of good and not for the facilitation of criminalities or the destabilization of the country. We can disagree, but Nigerians\u2019 lives matter.\n\n\u201cDifferences of opinion is not a problem; everybody will not think alike,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we want to use social media for good. There is a lot of good that can come out of communication today. Part of the conversation will be how to use them for global good,\u201d the minister further added.\n\nAsked if the government was seeking Chinese advice on how to place a firewall around the internet in the country, the minister said, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any meeting with the Chinese authorities in respect of social media.\u201d\n\nNBC threatens sanction\n\nMeanwhile, the NBC has directed all broadcast stations in the country still using the Twitter platform after its ban by the federal government to suspend the use of the platform with immediate effect.\n\nThe Commission maintained that its decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in the country over the persistent use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nActing NBC Director-General Prof. Armstrong Idachaba gave the directive in a statement issued Monday in Abuja.\n\nIn the statement titled \u201cSuspend Twitter handles\u201d, NBC directed the broadcast stations to un-install their Twitter handles and desist from using the platform as a source of information gathering for news, and programmes presentation especially the phone-in programmes.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all Broadcasting Stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn Compliance to the above directive, Broadcasting Stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for News and programmes Presentation especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules, and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of The Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nEnvoys summoned\n\nIn a relateddevelopment,the federal government has invited the envoys of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union in Nigeria, over their recent comments on the suspension of the operations of the social media platform, Twitter, in the country.\n\nThis was made known in an invitation to journalists issued Monday morning by the Crisis Monitoring and Public Communications Division of the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and signed by Kimiebi Ebienfa.\n\nThe invitation reads: \u201cI am directed to inform that following the recent ban on Twitter by the Federal Government and Press Statement issued by some Heads of Diplomatic Missions Accredited to Nigeria on the subject matter, the Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency, Geoffrey Onyeama has invited the affected Ambassadors to a meeting today at noon.\n\n\u201cThe venue is Minister\u2019s Conference Room, 8th Floor.\n\n\u201cYou are hereby invited to cover the meeting. Thanks for your usual cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe envoys were reported to have condemned the suspension in a joint statement, citing an infringement of the citizens\u2019 rights to freedom of expression.\n\nRCCG takes exception\n\nMeanwhile, an influential Nigerian Christian cleric, Mr Enoch Adeboye, has said tweets by his church were in accordance with the United Nations declaration on human rights, irrespective of the controversial ban on Twitter by the Nigerian government.\n\nAdeboye\u2019s church, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), has millions of followers across Nigeria and globally.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d he wrote via his official Twitter account Monday.\n\nAdeboye was reacting to allegations that he was flouting the order of the federal government suspending the use of the microblogging platform, Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, theGeneral Overseer, Deeper Christian Life Ministries, Pastor William Kumuyi has ignored the ban as he tweeted that content wouldn\u2019t stop being posted on the handle as it targets a global audience via his social media handle. He also noted that they share content from any of the location their churches were situated around the world.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than 5 continents and over 100 Nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d the cleric wrote.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked the federal government not to stop at anything that could avert another civil war in the country.\n\nNigeria had its first and only civil war between 1966 and 1970 during which the Eastern Region, mainly peopled by Igbo, attempted a secession from the then federal government led by Gen. Yakubu Gowon (retd).\n\nThere were attendant losses after the war, particularly on the side of the secessionists who wanted a Biafran Republic under Odumegwu Ojukwu, then a Colonel in the Nigerian Army.\n\nHowever, a truce was reached at Aburi, Ghana, during which the warring parties agreed to sheathe their sword and declared a \u2018no victor no vanquished\u2019 position with the 3Rs of Reconciliation, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.\n\nFresh threat\n\nBut addressing select journalists at the end of its meeting Monday in Abuja on the fresh threat from the South-east, NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the South-east political leaders are even afraid of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN), hence cannot curb insecurity in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has reviewed events and tendencies, which suggest that the country is headed for more crises. Nigerians live in fear of violence today and in fear of uncertain future. The capacity of the Nigerian State to secure citizens, protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity and resist violent assaults on our unity is weakening to the levels of making threats that have no impact.\n\n\u201cArmed criminals of all types have increased their audacious stranglehold over our lives in all parts of the country. Irredentists are increasingly asserting their influence over in the South East and some parts of the country, and in the manner that millions of Nigerians now live. Rhetorics from political leaders and ethnic champions who speak in threats and demands routinely suggest that the sentiments in support of irredentism are becoming more widespread.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN. Muted voices of millions of Igbo cannot be heard so that fellow Nigerians could understand the degree to which secession by the Igbo represents the popular choice.\n\n\u201cThis nation has had to fight a terrible war to preserve the country. The North had paid its dues in that war, as indeed it did in many ways throughout the history of the country. Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together. The North in particular has more than enough challenges, and we recognize that violent secession by any part of Nigeria will compound the problems all Nigerians live with.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way. It will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted. Until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it.\n\n\u201cWe support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North. Unlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\n\n\u201cThe Forum believes that it is vital to address amendments to the constitution and achieve major changes in the structure and operations of our Federal system now. Members of the National Assembly elected by Nigerians have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. This explains the major distances which exist between the people and the vital national institution which should play a major role mitigating national crises.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should explore additional avenues for tapping into opinions that can help redress serious limitations to the Federal system before the 2023 elections. The North is willing to discuss all matters related to constitutional amendments/ restructuring with the leadership of the country and other groups who see their presence in the future of Nigeria,\u201d NEF added.\n\nUmahi resigns\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the South East Security Committee, codenamed, Ebubeagu, Major-General Obi Abel Umahi (rtd) has resigned his position.\n\nUmahi tendered his resignation in a letter dated June 4, 2021, entitled: \u201cResignation as Chairman South East Security Committee \u2013 Ebubeagu\u201d and addressed to chairman of the South-East Governors Forum.\n\nIn the letter also copied to President General Ohanaeze Ndigbo Ambassador George Obiozor, Umahi said since the formation of the security outfit, the southeast governors had stifled it of funds and without providing it with an office space.\n\nPart of the letter reads: \u201cSince this Security Committee was formed, we deliberated and agreed on ways to raise security consciousness down to the community level in Igbo land, mode of operations, logistics and some types of equipment required, such as drones, vehicles etc. We also crafted the Concept of SE Security.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I chaired a 21-man Committee set up to draft a legal framework for the SE Security outfit. The committee was composed of members of SE Security committee, the Attorney generals of the five Southeast states and some prominent Igbo sons and daughters. The 21-man Legal Framework Committee was funded to completion by the Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cOn 11th April, 2021, SE Governors announced the formation of EBUBEAGU at Owerri. Subsequently, the draft legal framework produced by the 21-man Committee was reviewed by SE Security Committee members and the Attorney Generals of the five Se States to suit South East Ebubeagu Security outfit.\n\n\u201cThe SE Security Committee thoroughly prepared and submitted the modalities, including the structure, for the take-off of EBUBEAGU to the Governors\u2019 Forum during the security of South East Governors\u2019 Forum, attended by the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and some other Igbo leaders presented a request that Ebubeagu should be jointly rolled out as a matter of urgency and also funded by the Government of the five SE States. From inception to date, SE Security Committee was never funded at all in any capacity and not even an office space was provided.\n\n\u201cI respectfully request that Your Excellencies kindly permit me to resign my appointment as the chairman, SE Security Committee in the spirit of my love to serve Ndigbo, I can assure you that I will always be available to advice on the success of Ebubeagu at no cost, just as I served as the Chairman of South East Security Committee from 31 August, 2019 till date at no cost directly or indirectly to the five South East State Government, groups and individual. I highly appreciate Your Excellencies for the opportunity you gave me to serve Ndigbo.\u201d\n\nUmahi, who confirmed his resignation to journalists on telephone said, \u201cPlease be assured of my loyalty, respect and accept my highest regards of your esteemed considerations.\u201d",

Lukman, the Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) which will take place Friday, June I l , 2021.\n\nIn a statement issued by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu on behalf of the Organising Committee, the book is a contribution to APC\u2019s quest to bolster its democratic credentials towards engendering political stability, best practice, and good governance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Onilu, the book captures the distinctive progressive ethos and political worldview of APC as a bastion for national renaissance exemplified by patriotism and adherence to the rules of political engagements, and moral rectitude.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no better time to put this book together as APC grapples with the nitty-gritty of formative challenges. This is coming at a period when APC leaders availed members of the Nigerian progressive family the opportunity to relaunch the party more surefootedly as Nigeria\u2019s best vehicle to save Nigeria from the nagging socio-political uncertainties.\n\n\u201cThe book contains submissions that speak directly to the existential challenges the APC is facing; it illustrates the collective desire for enduring and firmly rooted democratic practices anchored on the overarching requirement for unity of all party leaders; it examines the hurdles that the APC is facing in its nascent democratic journey and cut open the underbelly of the numerous drawbacks in the leadership that it currently offer the nation through the political instruments it is deploying as a party.\n\n\u201cThis book is an essential intervention at this critical turn as APC leaders and members embark on the important task of putting in place new leadership structures at all levels and in underlying what the future bodes for the party in terms of laying a solid foundation for healthy contestations among varying interests and political players.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests is therefore, more than just a book. It is more of a workbook, standing at the intersection between the difficult past and the promising future. Its main agenda is to assist APC leaders and, indeed, all stakeholders in negotiating the next bend.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR will be the Special Guest of Honour. The Vice President Prof. Yemi Osibanjo GCON will be the Chief Guest of Honour and Chairman of occasion.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, APC Chairman, will be the host.

Femi Gbajabiamila, Secretary to Government of the Federation Mr. Boss Mustapha, Progressive Governors led by His Excellency, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Ministers, APC Senators and members of the House of the Party, members of the House of Representatives will be the Guests of Honour.\n\n\u201cAPC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will be the Father of the day. Her Excellency, Ambassador Fatima Balla will be the Mother of the day. Prof. Adebayo O. Olukoshi, Professor of Politics and Director for Africa and Asia will present the Keynote Address.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail later this week, an APC support group has stated.\n\nAccording to the group, the rail line is the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa, and the first Standard Gauge Rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration.\n\nThe group, under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness & Campaign, APC-LAC, emphasized that this landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after the president commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail , completed by his administration 33 years after construction began, adding that the 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by four notable APC chieftains, Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the support group maintained that the second Niger Bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.\n\nAPC-LAC further stated that other landmark projects being completed include the Bodo-Bonny Road in Rivers State, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Expressway, Loko-Oweto Bridge connecting Benue and Nasarawa States across the River Benue, Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway, East-West Road (across Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States), the new Ikom Bridge in Cross River, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi Road, and many more.\n\nThe group emphasized that President Buhari remained committed to building the infrastructure that will drive Nigeria\u2019s growth and prosperity.\n\nThey maintained that more road and rail infrastructures are being built and/or completed since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015.\n\nThey also boasted that President Buhari has fulfilled his promised on delivery of good infrastructure for the opening up of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, President Buhari promised to complete as many abandoned projects as possible, and he has worked hard to fulfil this promise. His administration has committed more resources to Infrastructure than any other administration since 1999. It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the President ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).\n\n\u201cBeyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari Administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. Between them these initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilize several billions of dollars in public and private financing.\n\n\u201cNew International Airport Terminals have been completed and commissioned in Abuja and Port Harcourt, while those in Lagos and Kano are being completed. In addition, brand new Runways have been constructed in Abuja and Enugu, in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cOff-grid solar and gas electrification programmes are being rolled out for homes, markets, educational institutions (Federal Universities, Unity Schools, Primary Healthcare Centers); and a National Mass Metering Programme launched in 2020 will deliver 6 million new electricity meters nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is also enabling and supporting the private sector to invest in critical infrastructure. Finally, a brand new Deep Sea Port is being constructed, in Lagos, the first new Deep Sea Port in the country in more than four decades; while ground-breaking for a second private-sector-funded Deep Sea Port (in Bonny) took place in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWith a diverse mix of financing options in place, the Buhari Administration has broken Nigeria\u2019s decades-old infrastructure development jinx and set new standards for future administrations to build upon,\u201d the group stated.",

He noted that the West African country cannot afford to fight another war to keep the Igbos seeing that Nigeria is on her knees and already burdened with failures.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way,\u201d the forum had said in the statement.\n\n\u201cIt will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe northern group also called for an end to the killings of northerners, security officials as well as attacks on government institutions especially in the southeast.\n\n\u201cThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted,\u201d the Forum noted.\n\n\u201cUntil the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have a responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it. We support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North.\n\n\u201cUnlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Nigeria and Cameroon will once more battle it out at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in the second of a two-match friendly programme in the Austrian capital, Vienna.\n\nFive \u2013time African champions Cameroon edged the first encounter 1-0 at the same venue on Friday, courtesy of a 36th minute strike by Andre Zambo Nguissa. The Super Eagles created chance after chance but failed to get the ball into the net.\n\nCoach Gernot Rohr spoke at length about having to use a rash of new players in the first session, but he is compelled to do even more of that in Tuesday\u2019s encounter following injuries to defenders William Ekong and Jamilu Collins, and the knock for pacy winger Moses Simon.\n\nSimon appeared to be getting better as of Monday morning, but the smart money is on him starting from the bench, just as Cyprus-based goalkeeper Francis Uzoho may start in goal against the Indomitable Lions. With the versatile Abdullahi Shehu heaved back to the rear from midfield for which he was initially pencilled down, and the couple of injuries from Friday\u2019s match, Rohr has had to extend invitation to Hungary \u2013based Vincent Onovo to fight for his first cap. Onovo arrived in the team hotel just after dinner on Sunday.\n\nA three-man defenceline is in the offing, with perhaps Chidozie Awaziem, who impressed in that unit on Friday, Abdullahi and Ozornwafor. Another late invitee, Anthony Izuchukwu, from Slovakia, is another possibility. A loaded midfield could include Onovo, with Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Samson Tijani and Abraham Marcus also on the roll.\n\nHome \u2013based professional Anayo Iwuala could start, with Paul Onuachu, Peter Olayinka, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, Moses Simon, Terem Moffi and Captain Ahmed Musa also to taste action.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s game, Rohr told the media: \u201cWe missed seven key players due to injuries, so it was not our best team, but it was good to see other players. We are not happy to lose the game, but we saw some interesting new young players.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s defeat was Rohr\u2019s first loss to Cameroon in four matches. The Eagles pounded the Lions 4-0 in Uyo and were held 1-1 in Yaounde in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in September 2017, and then edged the Lions 3-2 in the Round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt two years ago.\n\nThough a friendly game, fierce rivals Cameroon were very happy to prevail over Nigeria for the first time since winning the Africa Cup of Nations final on penalty shoot-out in Lagos 21 years ago. \u201cWe took the game seriously because we played against a tough opponent, a big game against a big rival. It was important for us to show our preparations, and I\u2019m happy we won,\u201d said Cameroon\u2019s Germany-based striker Eric Choupo-Moting.\n\nA sense of purpose to win the second game reigns supreme in the Eagles\u2019 Hilton Garden Inn camp in Wiener Neustadt, 46 kilometres outside Vienna.\n\nAfter a one-hour training session in the light drizzle on Sunday morning, the three-time African champions will have their last training session at the match venue on Monday evening. Captain Ahmed Musa says defeat in Tuesday\u2019s game is not an option.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy to have created so many chances and fail to score. We will approach the game differently on Tuesday. Cameroon is a big rival and we are not happy to have lost the game on Friday.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Maduka Okoye told thenff.com: \u201cWe bave taken some positives from the first match against Cameroon. We had a good game and it was unfortunate that they scored with just that one shot on target. However, we have shown that we are ready for the AFCON with the strength of character we showed after conceding the goal. We are ready to go for it on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nNew-boy Abraham Marcus said it was a dream come true for him to join up with the Nigeria camp. \u201cWhen the coach introduced me into the game, all I had in mind was to help the team get the equalizer. I look forward to another opportunity on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBoth teams have qualified for the finals of the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, which Cameroon will host in January 2022. Nigeria finished top of their group winning four of six matches and drawing two, while Cameroon also topped theirs though they had already qualified as hosts.\n\nThe two teams are using both matches to look at their general shape, form and structure ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches starting in September.",
