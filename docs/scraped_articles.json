          "text": "Medical practitioners in the country have commended the proposed move by the federal government to ban the importation of syringes and needles into the country.\n\nThe Minister of health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, had said that his ministry is working on a policy that would mandate government-owned health institutions to procure and use syringes manufactured in Nigeria.\n\nThe move was welcomed by a cross section of medical practitioners including Chief Medical Directors of government owned health institutions who spoke with our correspondent in the sidelines of the 94th Regular Meetings of CMDs/MDs of government health institutions which held at the Ibom Icon Hotel and Golf Resort, Uyo, Akwa Ibom.\n\nThe Chief Medical director of the Federal Medical Centre, Keffi in Nasarawa State, Dr. Adamu Yahaya, said the ban on importation of syringes into the country will improve Nigeria\u2019s capacity as a nation.\n\nAccording to him, it\u2019s a welcome development if the policy is implemented in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt will be a welcome development because it is the only way we can improve our capacity as a nation and also encourage local production. It\u2019s going to be in the best interest of our nation\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the Head of Clinical Services Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, Ogun State, Dr. Fedelis Ojeblenu, hailed the proposed policy saying it\u2019s a nice decision by the federal government.\n\nHe said Nigeria has so many professionals in virtually all fields of human endeavours who are well trained, adding that it would be better if Nigeria could manufacture high quality syringes and needles for local consumption.\n\n\u201cSyringes and needles are precision instruments, the material needed must be of high quality. Nigeria has the capacity to manufacture high quality Syringes and Needles for local consumption. And going by what I have seen so far, I think we have the capacity because we have well trained professional in virtually all fields. All we need to do is to access fund and let the private sector come on board. We cannot be importing everything,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief Medical director, FMC, Azaire, Bauchi State, Dr. Abdullahi Ibrahim said as an executive order of the federal government, local content is something that Nigerians must patronise in terms of procurement processes.\n\n\u201cAs an executive order of the President local content is something all Nigerians must patronise. The policy is about patronising local content in terms of procurement processes. It\u2019s going to be a very nice idea and should be given priority,\u201d he said.",

All this is happening just for those crooked politicians to disorganize us, but unfortunately for them we have gone far ahead of all their evil strategies.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are supporting Tinubu and calling on him, begging him, inviting him to contest the 2023 presidential election for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are out for the Tinubu 2023 project because we love Nigeria and we believe in the progress of this country.\n\n\u201cYou can believe me that Tinubu has laboured so much for the development of this country. We all know how he laboured to give us President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe need continuity. We need somebody that will continue and consolidate on the achievements President Buhari is making. We need somebody that knows the house, and that is Bola Tinubu.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, while addressing one of the new groups that merged with the DOJ recently from the North called Northern Voters\u2019 Awareness (NOVA), Alawuje called on the North to rally round Tinubu who he described as a detribalized Nigerian.\n\n\u201cAnd it is time to let the entire world know that Nigeria is one apart of those frustrated politicians who are trying to divide us.\n\n\u201cTinubu is a nationalist, a bridge builder and a visionary leader who has all it takes to take Nigeria to greater heights. He merits it and deserves to lead this country. We therefore urge him, plead with him to come out and close the mouth of those who are accusing us of wasting our time that he is not coming out, if at all he doesn\u2019t want it, we are begging him to start putting interest and come out and declare his ambition publicly, not to hesitate from answering this clarion call to contest the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Many times we recite our national anthem without considering the words in it, we can truly serve our country with love and strength if we believe in the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of call for restructuring and national dialogue because of the things we are seeing but we must continue to keep faith in our country.\n\n\u201cAs leaders we must truly examine ourselves to be sure that we are truly faithful, loyal and honest and to be sure that we are not serving ourselves by serving some sections and personal interests.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to see Nigeria as one country and all things done must be done truly in such a way that reflects that unity in us so that every zone will truly believe that we are in one Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile commending members of the State Assembly for their cooperation with the executive in the service of the state, he said: \u201cI thank God for this day because the 7th Assembly is here to thank God for their second anniversary.\n\n\u201cAm very proud of the DTHA because for whatever we have achieved under these trying times is because they have remained very supportive.\n\n\u201cMany times you have placed the interest of the state above personal interests and i believe that as we start off the third year that a new beginning will come into you to offer greater services in the remaining two years.\n\n\u201cI charge you redouble your efforts because we are in very difficult times, please remember that we are in service of the people of Delta and to give more than we have done before.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope and believe that we continue to humble ourselves, because it takes nothing away from us by being humble because God resisted the proud. It is my prayer that God will give you the strength and wisdom to continue in your service to the people\u201d.\n\nSpeaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori took the Bible reading from Psalm 92:1-10. Oborevwori who spoke to newsmen moments after the service, assured Deltans of good laws that would promote their well-being.\n\nHe thanked members of the House for their support and cooperation. He also thanked the Governor for his understanding and harmonious working relationship between the Executive and the Legislature arm of government.\n\nEarlier in a sermon titled \u201cUnderstanding the wonders of thanksgiving\u201d Pastor David Popoola urged Christians to always remember to appreciate God for his blessings upon their lives.\n\nPopoola maintained that thanksgiving was a debt that every Christian owes God, adding that: \u201cTo be ungrateful is to block your access to God\u2019s blessings and God will always bless those who show appreciation for His benevolence.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving multiplies our blessings, it preserves and perfects God\u2019s blessings upon our lives and facilitates answers to our prayers.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We are in the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which is composed of a minister per state. But we have one extra ministerial slot. So, the South East is effectively represented to ensure justice is done to our people. We are there to talk when there is no justice.\n\n\u201cPeople can say that we are not honoured with appointments of Inspector General of Police, Chief of Army Staff and Secretary to the Federal Government (SGF). These are positions we have enjoyed before in the Nigerian Federation. We had two Inspectors General of Police (IGP), Ogbonnaya Onovo and Mike Okiro. We had an SGF, Senator Pius Anyim. We had four Senate Presidents. Twice we produced Deputy Senate President and Deputy Speaker, Ike Ekweremadu and Emeka Ihedioha. They were in charge of federal budgets for eight years from 2007 to 2015. That is the rule in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo, if you now talk about appointments, it becomes a matter of perception. I won\u2019t blame them. Perception and reality are in the same line. A lot of them don\u2019t understand how government works. A lot of them don\u2019t understand that I a member of FEC can influence things that will come to my State, my zone or any other area and where we think things should be sited or done in Nigeria. For me, those people perceiving that are ignorant. I don\u2019t want to use the word mischievous.\n\n\u201cBut much, more importantly, propaganda against the government by the elites in the South-East should stop because it is that propaganda that provoked troubles that we are now noticing. People have been brainwashed and the separatists humped on that foundation to now shout from the rooftops that we will give you Biafra and when we give you Biafra, all these things will disappear.\n\n\u201cThere is no country that does not have its own problems. We have economic problems here and that is why we have unemployment and of course, we have a youth bulge in our population. About 60 per cent of them are youths and a lot of them are unemployed. So, the government is devising ways to tackle that. It is a work in progress.\u201d\n\nThe Minister recalled that the Buhari government had paid off all the gratuity and pensions of all the police pensioners in the South East that were neglected since after the war, which no government did before.\n\nHe said the Government assisted the 36 Governors with bailout funds to pay a shortfall in salaries in their respective states and went further to give them budget support to help them to execute budgetary projects and programmes and give life to their people.\n\nAccording to him, the Governors in the South-East zone received the support even though at the time, the zone was a PDP zone.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure wise, if you go to the South East, from Enugu-Okigwe and Umuahia-Aba-Port Harcourt expressways, three companies, the Chinese Company, the Arab Contractors and RCC are there. Some of them have completed their work. A journey that normally takes us five hours from Enugu-Aba is now about one hour, 15 minutes. When the Port Harcourt section is finished, a journey from Enugu to Port Harcourt will take two hours.\n\n\u201cComing to Enugu-Awka- Onitsha, two sections have been finished. RCC is working at the stretch from Awka to Onitsha now. The stretch from Ninth Mile to Oji River has been completed. We are now at the third Section which is being done by Niger-Cat from Amansea to Oji River. The Old Road from Ninth Mile to Awka has also been done by Arab contractors. If you go there now, you will see it is fully completed with drains on both sides.\u201d\n\nHe said the Owerri-Aba and Owerri-Umuahia roads are ongoing, just like the the international highway from Enugu to Abakiliki to Cameroun where the stretch from Enugu to Abakiliki is completed while the stretch from Abakiliki to Cameroun is ongoing.\n\n\u201cEnugu The airport used to be the worst airport in Nigeria. We had three Aviation Ministers, Fidelia Njeze, Stella Odua and Osita Chidoka and did nothing there. Buhari put N10 billion in Enugu Airport. He does not hate Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cThen, the Second Niger Bridge is the biggest of them all. President Buhari took it up from a Private Public Partnership (PPP) Project by which tolls were to be collected. By which foreign loan companies\u2019 financiers were relieved of doing what they wanted to do to stay there forever and ever and it is now a legacy project out of the five that is being done in the whole country.\n\n\u201cThe five legacy projects are Lagos-Ibadan highway, Mambilla project, East-West Road, Abuja-Kaduna-Kano and Second Niger Bridge and the Second Niger Bridge is gulping one of the biggest amounts of money; N386 billion and has undergone 55 per cent completion. Julius Berger said they will deliver in the middle of 2022 and we have no reason to doubt them.\u201d\n\nNgige stated that all these projects were being executed with Sukuk funds, loans and extra-budgetary provisions, since budgetary provisions were not enough.\n\nHe explained that the current administration has not earned enough revenue owing to crash in the price of oil and production level since it came to power, adding that \u201cwe are now getting about 50 per cent of what the previous the government got in terms of internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in their separate speeches, Eze Ndigbo, Niger State and President of Ndieze Igbo 19 Northern states and FCT Abuja, Eze (Dr) Pampas Nwahiwe and Eze Ndigbo Kano, Boniface Ibekwe, condemned the violence by suspected agitators in the South East who were attacking police and military formations and killing our security personnel, warning that their actions were capable of endangering the lives of their brothers who are living in other parts of Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "Also Read: Democracy Day: Protests sponsored, uncalled for \u2014 IdahosaAddressing the participants, Ngige said Buhari has shown friendship to Ndigbo, maintaining that the South East has gotten a fair share of what is due to the zone, especially infrastructure wise.\nSo, the South East is effectively represented to ensure justice is done to our people.\nIt is a work in progress.\u201dThe Minister recalled that the Buhari government had paid off all the gratuity and pensions of all the police pensioners in the South East that were neglected since after the war, which no government did before.\nAccording to him, the Governors in the South-East zone received the support even though at the time, the zone was a PDP zone.\n\u201cInfrastructure wise, if you go to the South East, from Enugu-Okigwe and Umuahia-Aba-Port Harcourt expressways, three companies, the Chinese Company, the Arab Contractors and RCC are there.",

          "text": "Traditional rulers of Midim community in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, have lamented over alleged arrest, intimidation and molestation of innocent persons in the community by security operatives in an attempt to clampdown on the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB\n\nThe traditional rulers who said they were in support of the government\u2019s directive to sanitise the community of the criminal elements and every form of secessionist move, condemned the way the security operatives are handling the matter.\n\nIn a press briefing on Sunday, the spokesman of the community, Mr. Victor Udom, expressed worry that security Operatives draw intelligence from a \u201d biased, mischievous and politically-influenced source adding that such biased intelligence has made the sanitation exercise unsuccessful, leading to arrest and intimidation of innocent people while the real hoodlums are let free.\n\nHis words, \u201cWe acknowledge recent efforts towards sanitizing the State of IPOB/ESN secessionist incursions and other terrorist banditry now taking over our State and we applaud the effort of the Joint Task Force, and other security agencies and we as always will be willing to support this laudable government initiative.\n\nCSP, military officers, others killed by hoodlums in Akpabio LG, Essien Udim\n\n\u201cWe are, however, very concerned that in embarking on this sensitive exercise, the agencies of government instead of involving credible and unbiased critical stakeholders in our community for effective and successful drive, rather chose getting intelligence from a glaringly biased, mischievous and politically influenced source resulting in the attendant near failures in getting the real hoodlums in various communities who are now made to flee in escape while our largely innocent victims or those with minor offences have been wrongly targeted for intimidation, arrest and extrajudicial eliminations as a quid-pro-quo\u201d\n\n\u201cWe protest in the strongest of terms, the recent takeover of our community, intimidating, indiscriminately arresting, torturing and deliberately implicating our people all in the name of routing members and subscribers to IPOB/ESN and unearthing other criminals by men of the Nigerian Police and Army.\n\n\u201d We condemn all acts of hostage takings, dehumanization and extra judicial killings of innocent people and urge you to intervene to bring all the acts of barbarism not known to law to an immediate end in Midim particularly and Essien Udim in general.\n\nHe said It was through the efforts of the community that the dreaded Akwa Marine Cult which specialises in raping, kidnapping and rigging of elections results was eliminated adding that ignoring such laudable efforts of the community and turning around to blackmail and intimidate and eliminate them is a conspiracy that should not be over looked.\n\nAkwa Ibom: JTF arrests 10 over murder of police officers, recover vehicles, ammunition\n\n\u201cWe are therefore very displeased that despite our efforts, we are being targeted with some mischievous blackmail as IPOB/ESN secession agitation sympathizers to intimidate us in our continuous engagements against the politically motivated cult gangs that invaded our communities.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing than a ploy by our politicians to reposition criminal formations in preparation for 2023 upcoming elections\u201d the statement said\n\nHe said the ongoing politics of framing up and instigating trump up charges on innocent youths of the Community is a strategy aimed at putting them out of circulation ahead of 2023 and one of the hypocrisy of the state government disguised as a security strategy that should worry any patriotic person who wish to see the state remain peaceful and prosperous.\n\nHowever, when the Public Relations Officer of the state police Command, SP Odiko Macdon, was contacted, he said the allegation is false and should be ignored.\n\nHe said \u201d How is that true? Of course, this is totally false. These people (security agents) just arrived there a few days ago and who is giving that kind of report?\u201d",

The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship.

          "title": "Money, not sex, freaks me \u2013Angel Emeka, actress",
          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nGifted with the talent to crack jokes, Angel Emeka earned herself first movie role a few years ago, and since then she has not looked back.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, the single mother of two talked about her career, love, sex and marriage. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you get into the movie industry?\n\nA costumier of mine who is a Nollywood script supervisor by name, Ebuka, may his soul rest in peace, came to my boutique with his friend, Chinedu Arinze, a location manager. They came to buy some stuff and I cracked them up, they laughed all day and told me that I can do well in the film industry. I laughed at them and had a flash back on what my mom always told me that she sees me as an actress in future, and since then I have always dreamt of it. So, I decided to give it a trial, and I went with them to the movie location in Asaba where they introduced me to a movie producer called, Solo Amaco, who gave me a role instantly to act with Joyce Kanu. I was so much scared of acting with her because that was my first time of meeting her, and I started crying due to the fear in me. But Madam Joyce Kanu noticed it was my first time and she consoled me and gave me the courage never to be scared. Being a market fight scene, she asked me to see her as my friend and fight her as if we\u2019re fighting for real, which I did in fear and the job came out well.\n\nHow was your growing up?\n\nGrowing up wasn\u2019t easy for my siblings and I, because we lost our dad at an early stage; but my mom is a strong woman. May God keep her for me!\n\nWhat was the first movie or series you acted in?\n\nThe first movie I acted in was Hour of Tears.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced when you first got into the industry?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to have a break when you\u2019re new because the producers and directors do not know how good you are. So, many of them find it very difficult to cast you in a movie, but I prayed for God\u2019s favour, which has been working for me till now.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nMy kids and my business, I don\u2019t joke with these two. I love spending quality time with my kids and anyone that knows me very well will also tell you that I am a business tycoon and an entrepreneur, but my career has taken most of my time.\n\nHow many movies have you acted in so far?\n\nI can\u2019t recall exactly the number because I stopped counting six years ago.\n\nWhat current projects are you working on?\n\nI am working on my personal movie titled, Highlander, which is on post-production. I also finished a movie project, which I produced last month and it\u2019s currently airing on YouTube as we speak. The title is Village Jagaban.\n\nWhats your first experience in front of the camera, were you nervous?\n\nI wasn\u2019t nervous, because Joyce Kanu carried me along. But in my second movie, I was nervous because an actor made the set so uncomfortable for me. He shouted at me, saying I was not acting well, which made me cry like a baby. I ran to my car and went home because the shame was too much for me. However, the director made him to understand that I was new in the game and he felt bad, apologized and encouraged me to be stronger. Today, he is my bestie.\n\nWhat were you doing before this and what was the experience like?\n\nI was into importation of red wine, and boutique business. I was enjoying it because business is my thing as well.\n\nWhat was the turning point in your career?\n\nWhen I produced my first movies, Love From Panya and Dino`s Family.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI go for vacation with my kids, visit the zoo and chill with my girls.\n\nWhat quality or sexy part earned you your first movie role?\n\nIt\u2019s my Chinese baby face, bowlegs, hard work as well as my size. Amaco gave me the first role because of my body size. He needed someone big that can fight Joyce Kanu and I fitted into the character.\n\nWhich movie gave you the big break?\n\nAssembles of God and Ghetto University.\n\nMost men can hardly get their eyes off you; how do you cope with them?\n\nI end up making them my friends because we may end up doing businesses together. All my life I prefer making men my friends.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a male fan or admirer has done to you?\n\nOne of my male fans poured chocolate ice cream on me while trying to take picture with me. It was fun, but crazy.\n\nHow do you intend to break into the A-list in this highly competitive industry?\n\nI\u2019m focused on my talent; with God by my side, I know I will get to the top.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-married actress, what is your stand on divorce?\n\nBroken marriages have nothing to do with the movie industry, just pray God to keep your home. Marriages break up on daily basis not only in Nollywood.\n\nIs marriage far or near for you?\n\nI now want to focus on my career because my first marriage wasn\u2019t fun and I am not fully healed.\n\nHave you said no to marriage proposal?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve said no to many because I am not ready for marriage yet.\n\nNow, how would you safeguard your next marriage?\n\nI will do everything possible to keep my marriage when the time comes. Marriage is sweet when you marry your man, a man that will love and endure you as his queen, and you respect and submit to him as your king.\n\nWhat does sex mean to you?\n\nSex means nothing to me because I am not a sex freak. I can stay for five years without sex, as long as my business is doing well and my kids are happy.\n\nThere are women who cannot get their eyes off a sexy lady like you; do you also have women that woo you?\n\nYes, but I don\u2019t give room to that madness.\n\nAre you in a relationship now?\n\nI am not in any relationship for now. I am still very much single. I am a single mother.\n\nWhat are the qualities you desire in a man?\n\nHe must be handsome, God-fearing, humble, loving, caring, and well dressed.\n\nHow do you handle sexual urge especially now that you\u2019re not in any relationship?\n\nI am not a sex freak; the only thing that freaks me is money.\n\nDo you have men asking you to be their second wife?\n\nYes, many times, but I believe in one man, one wife.\n\nCan you marry a man much older than you?\n\nNo! I don\u2019t like old men. When I was much younger, I had a bad experience that made me not to give any old man a chance to my heart. So, I don\u2019t see myself marrying someone much older than me except It\u2019s the will of God.\n\nHow would you advise young people who want to go into acting?\n\nThey should be focused and consistent because acting needs a lot of time if you really want to make it in the movie business.",

          "title": "NDDC board: What Niger Delta people want Buhari to do to Akpabio \u2014Comrade Joseph Evah",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nNational leader, Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah has warned that unless something serious is done to salvage the present state of insecurity in the country, there may not be any election in 2023.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he also blamed the Southeast leaders for their latest culture of silence and fear as the major reason for the continued violence in the region.\n\nThe activist was also critical on the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s twitter handlers, as well as his lashes out the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, advocating for his sack.\n\nHe spoke on other national issues, including the recent constitution review exercise by the National Assembly with a verdict that nothing good will come out of it. Excerpt:\n\nLet\u2019s know the latest happening on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\n\nThe Niger Delta Ministry Minister, Godswill Akpabio is simply exhibiting madness, so we are following him up. He is the problem of NDDC, constituting stumbling block. Akpabio said we are frustrating them, he thought that NDDC is their political game centre so we are telling him that we have had enough of his arrogance. He went to Tompolo Gharamatu to go and beg him, he thought that Tompolo is someone that can be bribed because he believes that in Nigeria everybody has a price and bribable. No. Tompolo is not that type of person, he is one with credibility and integrity, that is why we have a lot of respect for him. What is the problem of Akpabio for not inaugurating the NDDC board? What is his problem? So, when he looks at the Niger Delta people he feels and thinks that he can put us in his pocket? When did he join politics? It is just like the way some of his former governor friends are behaving like drunkards. Look at the way some of them are behaving, common sense they don\u2019t have. It is disgracing. The problem is that most of them seem to forget their past, they forget where they are coming from and proscribed the memory of their past. In life anybody that forgets about his past when they get little opportunity you see them behaving like drunkards and you are going to leave the office one day, so why the arrogance? They seem to forget that power is transient, just temporary. When you leave the office is it not that same people you despised that you will meet again? Won\u2019t you come back for something else? We expect President Buhari to sack Akpabio quickly, if Akpabio will not face his Ministry of Niger Delta where there is no money to spend. But because of the type of money that the oil companies are giving to NDDC, Akpabio is focusing only on NDDC to build his own political jamboree in 2023, we will not allow it. The Ministry of Niger Delta is dead under Akpabio\u2019s watch, and he is not doing anything about it in Abuja. Because of the controversy in NDDC no money is going to NDDC from budgetary allocation. Akpabio is a confusionist and he should repent, but I expect the president to remove and replace him so that we can have peace. It is because of his gambling for 2023 that Akpabio is causing all this confusion.\n\nHow do you see the constitution review panels of the National Assembly?\n\nI do not see anything good or cheering coming out of it because our politicians are not sincere, if not for their insincerity and deceit something good should come out of it. Are they ready to let us have one chamber instead of this two chambers (House of Representatives and Senate) that we are wasting millions on? Which of them will be patriotic enough to say that this two chambers that we are operating, we are wasting so much money, that we should go back to our parliamentary system so as to save money? How many of the lawmakers are ready to sacrifice for their present positions now? They are ready for this wasteful system that is going on. I See what they are doing as mere jamboree because they are not sincere. Are you saying that they don\u2019t know our problem? Are you saying that they don\u2019t know that the system we are running is wasteful? But because they are benefitting from it themselves you will find out that they will not be genuinely committed to any serious review. Which of them will say: Let us go back to the parliamentary days, that we should have only one National Assembly, one chamber unlike this expensive nonsense we are practicing now. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are simply wasting money. Let us put that money in education. How many of them will suggest that? Let them start by examining themselves first. I don\u2019t see anything credible coming out of it and the reason as I said is simple. The people who are arranging it, managing it, midwifing it never won election in the first place, so they are alienated from their people. What the people want is not what they want. Can the National Assembly that we have today agree to go back to the parliamentary years so that we have one house (unicameral) making the law. Members of the National Assembly should start from themselves to get credibility and others will follow them and respect them. But for now, they are just wasting money, junketing the entire country, enjoying themselves in the hotels where they stay in the name of public hearing. I do not see any sincerity in what they are doing and I know I will be vindicated at last; nothing good will come out of it.\n\nWhat is your view on President Buhari\u2019s comment against the Southeast on Twitter, the removal of his tweet and the banning of Twitter in the country?\n\nI still think that our President\u2019s Twitter handlers should be more cautious on what they push out. You may find out that Buhari will not tweet such message on his own, sometimes the president is not aware of such tweets. There are many things they are doing in that Villa that the president is not aware of. His Twitter handlers need to exercise caution sometimes, seeing how the country is going volatile. There is need to manage any news, message, information coming from the presidential desk. I can tell you that the president was not aware of that tweet until his attention was drawn to it and they will start damage control. I think the president should caution those media aides that do those tweets with his name, they are taking so many things for granted, we should be sincere to ourselves. The president should caution those individuals who tweet things in his name that are not his ideology, individuals who create imaginary problems for him where there is none. The president I can tell you is not aware, I am not saying may not be aware, but that he was not aware of that tweet because he would not allow it. It is like what Akpabio is doing in the Niger Delta, he will just go and tell one of the personal assistants to the president that this is the thinking of the Niger Delta people and they will be pushing the agenda even without the president knowing. There is so mush deceit over there that a lot is outside the knowledge of Mr. President. They do not have access to the president\u2019s bedroom, but they know people who have such access, those are the people they go and lobby and they come out to say that the president said this and that when in truth the president is in the dark on those issues. Do you think President Buhari will tell the Attorney General to go and start comparing herdsmen with Igbo spare parts dealers? Can you imagine that logic in this 21st Century? If we are in a sane society that minister is supposed to resign. For that minister to open his mouth to compare bandits, herdsmen that are killing people, even in their own area, raping women among other atrocities and you compare them with spare parts dealers, such thinking is worrisome. When you see some of these things you begin to ask yourself, is this still the country that Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe etc, founded? Some of the things we hear and see these days about Nigeria are disturbing and you begin to ask yourself, how did we get here.\n\nI know you are aware of the massive support that former Lagos State governor and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is getting with the formation of SWAGA (Southwest Agenda for Asiwaju). What is your take on the development?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. They can go on with their massive support for him. He has the right to contest. I know a lot of people seem to be looking at the Southeast, but their political leaders and elders must rise up to the occasion of what is going on there now, the orgy of killings, the violence, destructions etc and stop it. What is going on in the Southeast is a signal, those who are sponsoring them are saying: Don\u2019t mention Southeast for the presidency in 2023, that is the signal. Those who are sponsoring destruction of police stations, burning of INEC offices, destruction of prisons, killing of policemen and other security agencies have a terrible agenda and the elders and political leaders in the Southeast are simply watching, keeping silent. This their new culture of silence and fear is not doing them any good. What are we saying? Are we saying that there is no leadership in the Southeast to stop this carnage, the self-destruction that is going on? Are you saying there is no political leadership and elders that can stop what is happening in the Southeast? When you are burning INEC offices and materials what will you use to conduct election? People that have committed crime and facing punishment you go and release them, why? I hope that the Southeast leaders should sit down and know that the signal is very clear and very dangerous for their political future. The Southeast leaders should investigate what is happening, the Yoruba are doing it. They should stop relying on conspiracy theory and folding their hands. Why can\u2019t they rise up to investigate what is happening? So, even if it is coming from the outside you fold your hands until the police do their investigation? No, they should open their eyes and track down what is happening, they should do their own thorough investigation too to compare with whatever other investigation that will be done either by the police or whoever. Igbo leaders have to arrest the situation, it is not something that they should wait for anybody to come and do for them. What is happening there is unacceptable. If there are saboteurs expose them, nobody will take any excuse on what is happening there because the Igbo must put their house in order. They must call a spade a spade, saying that outsiders are doing it, it is a fake cry, nobody will listen to such excuse; they have to unravel what is happening there. A political zone with not less than five states and the elders, governors, political leaders, senators cannot sit down and say: we must do something to stop this carnage. Even if what is happening is coming from the outside they can, with unity among them resist and stop it. You cannot be there and your environment, your heritage is being destroyed and you are talking of conspiracy theory, you are keeping silent. Are those people doing the destruction spirits? Igbo leadership must swing into action to unravel what is happening if they are serious. And they have the capacity to do it if they want to.\n\nBut you know that orders come from Abuja as far as security issues are concerned?\n\nSo, if Abuja did not respond or yet to respond you wait until you die waiting for Abuja? Look, every community in Nigeria has vigilante, every street has vigilante group, and wherever people are living they have a vigilante group. And we are aware even from reports from the social media of the vigilante in Igbo land which they are boasting off. If you go to Asaba area and see the vigilante group there you will fear, go to Delta North and see the powerful vigilante groups that people from Governor Okowa area has set up, beyond the Nigeria Police Force. In those areas people are contributing money from everywhere, from abroad, to sustain it for their security. Look, I am worried that if this security challenge remains this way there will be a big challenge with conducting any election. As I speak, you cannot travel from Bayelsa to Warri, you cannot travel to anywhere without being afraid, bandits are everywhere. I don\u2019t see the 2023 election taking place from the insecurity that is on now. Do you know the curfew that is in Rivers State? Rivers State is worse than Abia. We are praying that Rivers State problem does not extend to Bayelsa and the riverine areas. Poverty is coming, food is not moving round again because of the insecurity. As we speak now students are still in captivity. I am an educationist, why will I be happy to hear that children are still in captivity. In the house when I look at my daughter I imagine that somebody\u2019s daughter is still in captivity for one month. What is happening in the country is frightening. What are the Imams and the pastors telling our leaders who are members of their congregations? They should stop them from entering the mosques and churches. Let there be ushers on the ground that will be driving them away.",

          "title": "Anxiety as Nigeria\u2019s debt burden hits N32.9 trillion",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock currently pegged at N32.915 trillion (as at December 31, 2020), many are worried that the country is being boxed into a debt trap it may never wriggle out from in decades to come.\n\nThe figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to economic experts, plausible reasons for the swell in the external debts include lower oil prices, disproportionate spending, COVID-19, defence of the exchange rate, over-reliance on crude oil receipts (with all its volatilities) and poor economic diversification agenda, among others.\n\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\n\nThis period corresponds with the Presidency of Buhari, who assumed leadership of the country on May 29, 2015.\n\nAccording to the statistics, Nigeria\u2019s total debt as at June 30, 2015 stood at N12.12 trillion.\n\nHowever, by December 31, 2020, the country\u2019s debt portfolio had risen to N32.92 trillion.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s debt was N12.6 trillion. It rose to N17.4 trillion in 2016 and then N21.7 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s debt had climbed to N24.4 trillion. It ballooned to N27.1 in 2019 and finally N32.915 trillion as at December 31 last year.\n\nThis shows that within a period of 66 months (five and half years), the country\u2019s debt grew by N20.8 trillion.\n\nIt also means that within the period, the country\u2019s debt portfolio rose by 171.62 per cent.\n\nDomestic sources accounted for N20.21 trillion, while external sources accounted for N12.71 trillion.\n\nIn percentage terms, external debts accounted for 38.6 per cent of the total debt portfolio while domestic debts accounted for 61.4 per cent.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\n\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\n\nWhile servicing local debts gulped N8.53 trillion between July 2015 and December 2020, servicing external debts gulped N1.72 trillion from 2016 to December 2020 (external debt servicing converted to naira at the exchange rate prevailing at the time, provided by the DMO).\n\nThe data provided by the DMO showed that from July to December 2015, N489.59 billion was spent on servicing local debts.\n\nFrom January to December, a total of N1.23 trillion was spent to service the country\u2019s domestic debts in 2016. The figure rose to N1.48 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s domestic debt servicing bill rose to N1.8 trillion. The cost of domestic debt servicing came down a bit in 2019 to N1.69 trillion. In 2020, it rose again to N1.85 trillion.\n\nOn the other hand, external debt servicing consumed $353.09 million in 2016. It went up to $464.05 million in 2017 and jumped up to $1.47 billion in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the nation spent $1.33 billion on external debt servicing. In 2020, external debt servicing gulped $1.56 billion.\n\nTo rescue the country from the thorny situation, President Buhari has been going cap in hand begging for debt relief for the country at different international fora, but without success thus far.\n\nHis efforts mimic those of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in 2006, when she led Nigeria and the Paris Club to seal a final agreement for debt relief worth $18 billion and an overall reduction of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock by $30 billion.\n\nOn his part, the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele has called on the state governors to wean themselves off the addiction to loans and monthly federal subvention by investing heavily in agriculture, especially in crops they have comparative advantage. With that, they can help solve the food insecurity nightmare and go into massive exports to pay their debts and build prosperity for their respective states.\n\nThe rise in the country\u2019s debt servicing reflected the nation\u2019s increasing commitment to external loans.\n\nThe debt accumulation is coming at a time when key government officials in the Economic Management Team have repeatedly defended the country\u2019s debt level, arguing that it is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has severally insisted that Nigeria does not have a debt problem.\n\nAccording to her, what the government needed to do was to increase its revenue generating capacity in order to boost revenue to about 50 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cNigeria does not have a debt problem. What we have is a revenue problem.\n\n\u201cOur revenue to GDP is still one of the lowest among countries that are comparable to us. It\u2019s about 19 per cent of GDP and what the World Bank and IMF recommended is about 50 per cent of GDP for countries that are our size. We are not there yet. What we have is a revenue problem\u201d, she posited at a recent Finance Summit.\n\nHowever, the Finance Minister\u2019s position differs with that of some economic experts who said that the huge borrowings portend danger for the economy.\n\nFor instance, a Chartered Accountant, Mr Ezekiel Ifeanyi said the Federal Government\u2019s current fiscal position constrains it from embarking on such huge expenditure as a result of accumulated large deficits over the past few years.\n\nHe said that the huge debt remains a burden for the economy, adding that time has come for Nigeria to begin to seek debt relief from its creditors.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\n\u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escaping from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn\u201d, Ezekiel stated.\n\nAlso, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, at a virtual conference organised by Elombah Television in 2020, warned that with the rise in the country\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio, Nigeria was heading towards a sovereign debt crisis.\n\nHe noted that the terms and conditions attached to the Chinese loans were not favourable to Nigeria.\n\nThe former presidential candidate canvassed public private partnership (PPP) as the best and sustainable way to fund strategic infrastructure projects.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one problem is not just Nigeria\u2019s loan to China, but it is the broader external indebtedness. Nigeria is essentially walking into a sovereign debt crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that we now spend virtually all that we earn servicing foreign debt.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Government\u2019s total revenue was about N950 billion, but we spent N943 billion servicing external debt, which was about 99 per cent. Is a country on this path fiscally viable?\n\n\u201cWe are taking more and more of these loans and we are told by the Debt Management Office (DMO) that our debt to GDP ratio is under control and is below 30 per cent, and that it does not matter.\u201d\n\nHe explained that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s revenue \u201cis from crude oil. So, when those revenues are plunging, then that is a huge risk because your debt obligations are fixed.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is such a serious mismatch between what you are earning and what you have to pay those you are owing, then you have a crisis. And that is the real problem for Nigeria today with its loan from China.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nigeria\u2019s lenders are offshore corporations, with China being Nigeria\u2019s biggest creditor.\n\nNigeria has agreed $5.6 billion in loans with China. But as of March 2020, Beijing had disbursed $3.3 billion. With Nigeria already servicing the loans, $3.1 billion was outstanding as at then.\n\nHowever, commenting on the rising debt, the DMO explained that it was not an entirely gloomy situation. It noted that after Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of new borrowing at the federal level, as shown in the annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the government\u2019s measures to moderate the rate of growth in the public debt stock in order to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nThe DMO added that new borrowing to part-finance budget deficits had declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018. It was N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThis trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as new borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 trillion. Many countries including the advanced countries also increased their level of borrowing as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted though, that apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund ($3.34 billion) and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\n\u201cThis incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 budget and the additional issuance of promissory notes to settle some arrears of the Federal Government of Nigeria, contributed to the increase in public debt stock. New domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.\n\n\u201cTotal public debt to GDP as at December 31, 2020 was 21.61 per cent which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40 per cent. The various initiatives of the government to increase revenues such as the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative and the Finance Act, 2020, should help shore up government\u2019s revenue and reduce the debt service to revenue ratio\u201d, the DMO explained.\n\nBut amid fears of Nigeria\u2019s high debt exposure to China, the DMO reassured that there was nothing to panic about as the loans were concessional with interest rates of 2.50 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and a moratorium of seven years.\n\nIt added that the communist country was not a major source of funding for the Federal Government, despite the fact that total borrowing from China, as at March 31, 2020, stood at $3.121 billion or N1,126.68 trillion using the N361/$1 conversion template.\n\nThe DMO ruled out the possibility of China taking possession of the projects financed by them if Nigeria defaults in servicing the loan.\n\nThe DMO emphasized that Nigeria explicitly provides for debt service on its external and domestic debt in its annual budgets, adding that a number of the projects being (and to be) financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue.\n\nIt added that the $3.121 billion Chinese debt represents only 3.94 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total public debt of $79.303 billion (N28,628.49 trillion at $1/N361) as at March 31, 2020.\n\nDMO said: \u201cSimilarly, in terms of external sources of funds, loans from China accounted for 11.28 per cent of the external debt stock of $27.67 billion at the same date.\n\n\u201cThese data show that China is not a major source of funding for the Nigerian government.\n\nThe terms of the loans are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. In addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to the government, while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\n\u201cThese two benefits make the provisions for debt service in the annual budget lower than they would otherwise have been if the loans were on commercial terms\u201d.\n\nThe DMO further explained that the $3.121 billion Chinese loans are project-tied facilities.\n\nIt listed the 11 projects as; Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail Project, Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion Project, (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) and Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja \u2013 Keffi- Makurdi Road Project.\n\nIt further noted that the impact of these loans is not only evident but visible. For instance, the Idu \u2013 Kaduna rail line has become a major source of transportation between Abuja and Kaduna. Also, the new International Airport in Abuja, has improved air transportation for the populace, while the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan rail line when completed, will ease traffic on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\n\u201cThe projects also have the added benefits of job creation, not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers, a number of which are Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development. Using Loans from China to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position.\n\n\u201cThe principal process and requirements for borrowing by the government are expressly stated in the Debt Management Office Establishment (ETC) Act, 2003 (DMO Act) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. Section 21 (1) of the DMO Act, \u2018No External loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution\u2019 and Section 41 (1a) of the FRA, \u2018Government at all tiers shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development, provided that, such borrowing shall be on concessional terms with low interest rate and with a reasonable long amortization period subject to the approval of the appropriate legislative body where necessary\u2019, are instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning works with the MDAs under whose portfolio a proposed loan falls and also with the DMO. Thereafter, the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) is sought. It is only after the approval by FEC that His Excellency requests for the approval of the National Assembly as required by Section 41 of the Fiscal responsibility Act, 2007. More importantly, it is only after the approval of NASS that the loans are taken and Nigeria begins to draw down on the loans.\n\n\u201cThe loan agreements are reviewed by legal officers of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the Legal Opinion of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is obtained before any External Loan Agreement is signed\u201d, the DMO added.\n\nCommenting on Nigeria\u2019s ballooning debt profile, Nigeria\u2019s first professor of the Capital Markets and former Imo State Finance Commissioner, Prof Uche Uwaleke explained that the crash in revenue generation always leads the Nigerian government to borrow.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to make conscious efforts to have multiple streams of income, including through embracing the private sector to develop the enabling environment for this to happen. The economy has remained vulnerable to external shocks due to inability to hugely diversify revenue sources.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the economy went into recession twice since 2015 owing in part to fall in crude oil prices and the forex challenge that came with the two cycles.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, there is no evidence to suggest that the bulk of the borrowing has gone into self-liquidating capital projects. A major cause of naira depreciation is the huge forex spent importing petroleum products in a period of rising crude oil prices. The huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.\n\n\u201cThe lasting solution is to create multiple sources of forex via export diversification and to curtail demand through import substitution and patronizing locally made products\u201d, he stated.\n\nBut the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said at a recent Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria 2021 Fellow Conferment ceremony in Lagos, that Nigeria was adopting the best practices of sustainable debt management.\n\nAccording to him, the repayment plan of the debt is tied to the projects for which the loan is taken.\n\nThe presidential aide noted that \u201call the terms and conditions of the loans are laid before the National Assembly and approved in detail before execution.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid the terms being approved by the National Assembly after the loan agreement must have been executed. A number of projects being and to be financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue\u201d.\n\nThe above assertion notwithstanding, experts insist there is a need for Nigeria to build revenue to have more space to spend for infrastructure, social safety nets and others. This is to avoid interest on the loans eating up the bulk of the revenue.",

          "title": "COVID-19 2nd jab: Fear as first batch of AstraZeneca vaccine expires in few weeks",
          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, this year, Nigeria took delivery of four million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said to be the first batch of expected vaccines, preparatory to vaccination exercise in Nigeria.\n\nThis was after several \u201cdelays\u201d and shift in arrival date, perhaps due to failed logistics arrangements or other unforeseen circumstances that elongated the arrival of the vaccines.\n\nGAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with the help UNICEF was said to had faciliated the procurement and shipping of the vaccine.\n\nOn Friday, March 5, the vaccination exercise was flagged off in Abuja. This was after the National Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had certified the vaccine safe for use.\n\nA brief ceremony to herald the commencement of the exercise was held at the Trauma Centre, National Hospital, Abuja, with impressive representation of the officials of the Federal Government and other stakeholders.\n\nAt about 11:05 a.m, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, a family physician, Senior Registrar at National Hospital, Abuja, was administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, marking the historic commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, administered the vaccine to Dr. Ngong, who was deeply appreciated for giving his best professionally to COVID-19 patients at one of the isolation centres in Abuja.\n\nThereafter, vaccination began across the states. Several parameters were used to distribute the vaccines to states, and that include adequate maintenance of cold chain storage facilities, transportation of logistics to the ward/ health facility, adequate security during transportation and at vaccination sites, completion of training of health workers, efficient social mobilization activities in place, as well as adherence to protocol for vaccine deployment.\n\nData from the national call-in dash board domiciled at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) indicated that as at June 6, when the administration of the first dose of vaccines ended, 1,966,128 million persons were vaccinated. Lagos State led with 313, 433 persons vaccinated. FCT, Kano and Kaduna states followed with 132,483; 95,963; 92,999 people vaccinated, respectively.\n\nData, however, obtained from the NPHCDA indicated that second dose of the vaccination begun immediately, after about four months.\n\nAs at June 6, data from NPHCDA vaccination dash board indicated that 336,501 had received their second jab.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s fear and anxiety on the ability of the vaccines reaching clients before its expiration.\n\nThere are indications that millions of doses of the vaccine in the first batch of consignment will expire in few weeks, precisely, June 28 and July 9, respectively.\n\nNPHCDA Executive Director, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, was quoted to have confirmed at the National media briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 recently that the AstraZeneca vaccine will expire soon\n\nHe said: \u201cThe batches of AstraZeneca we received some months ago have expiring dates of June and July, respectively. Howbeit, vaccination again is ongoing in all states of the federation. Our collaboration with health officials and other stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels in the vaccination exercise has yielded substantial results.\u201d\n\nHe also said there would be delay in the arrival of another consignment of the vaccines which may also affect and impact the remaining phases of the vaccination campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, a credible source at the PSC hinted that procurement of another batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not in the plan of the Federal Government, rather the government is considering Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine because of cost, storage facilities and other unique features.\n\nRecall that NAFDAC, few weeks ago, confirmed J&J COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria, after a report by its vaccine committee confirmed that data on the vaccine were robust and met criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.\n\nNAFDAC boss, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, had noted that most commonly reported side effects of the J&J vaccine are pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea, and most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last for one to two days.\n\nShe said the data also showed that the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks thereby supporting the manufacturer\u2019s recommended use.\n\nShe confirmed that the J&J vaccine is administered as a single dose as against the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that is administered twice to confirm its efficacy, adding that the results from a clinical trial involving people in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries found that the vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe phase III clinical trial involved over 44,000 people. Half of them received a single dose of the vaccine and half were given placebo (a dummy injection). Many of them did not know if they were given J&J COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\n\n\u201cThe trial found a 67 per cent reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received J&J COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe explained that J&J COVID-19 vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19, and an unopened vaccine vials can be stored and/or transported frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C for up to 24 months and three months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ngong, who was the first to take AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said that he took the second dose of the vaccine after 10 weeks, and he had no reaction.",
          "summary": "At about 11:05 a.m, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, a family physician, Senior Registrar at National Hospital, Abuja, was administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, marking the historic commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria.\nMeanwhile, a credible source at the PSC hinted that procurement of another batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not in the plan of the Federal Government, rather the government is considering Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine because of cost, storage facilities and other unique features.\nRecall that NAFDAC, few weeks ago, confirmed J&J COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria, after a report by its vaccine committee confirmed that data on the vaccine were robust and met criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.\nMany of them did not know if they were given J&J COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ngong, who was the first to take AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said that he took the second dose of the vaccine after 10 weeks, and he had no reaction.",

It was gathered that the EndSARS protests in 2020 made the government more desperate to control the cyberspace.\n\nIn a December 2020 report, University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, noted that the Nigeria\u2019s Defence Intelligence Agency had acquired equipment that it can use to spy on its citizens\u2019 calls and text messages.\n\nUniversity of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab researches on digital surveillance, security, privacy and accountability.\n\nThe report, titled Running in Circles: Uncovering the Clients of Cyber-espionage Firm Circles, said a telecom surveillance company by the name of Circles has been helping state security apparatuses across 25 countries, including Nigeria, to spy on the communications of opposition figures, journalists, and protesters.\n\nThe Citizen Lab report also said Circles was affiliated with Tel Aviv-based NSO Group, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, whose software, Pegasus, has allegedly been used by several governments to spy on dissidents by taking control of their smartphone, its cameras and microphones, and mining the user\u2019s personal data.\n\nCircles, on the other hand, is known for selling systems to exploit Signalling System 7 (SS7) vulnerabilities and claims to have sold the technology to several countries, according to the report.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "title": "From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?",
          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",

          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words.

Dep Gov\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu on Saturday in Benin, called on Nigerians to work together in sustenance of democratic ideals so as to provide room for equity, freedom of speech and sustainable development.\n\nShaibu stated this while addressing a cross section of protesters who were in a peaceful protest to Edo Government House, Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have distinguished between the military and civil rule. We have agreed that the difference is freedom of speech. Democracy is here to stay. We have fought for the sustenance of democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of the 14 lawmakers-elect who abdicated their roles, he said, \u201cI also want to address the issue of the 14 Edo State House of Assembly members-elect who failed to make themselves available for swearing-in after Governor Godwin Obaseki issued a proclamation letter.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I don\u2019t have a representative from Etsako West Constituency II because these characters decided to follow a godfather shortly after they were voted into office. Today, godfathers have taken over our democracy.\n\n\u201cThey have taken over democracy that you and I struggled for. The democracy that the likes of Ransome Kuti and Gani Fawehinmi fought for. All of them struggled to have democracy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the development has destroyed the fabric of our society, adding, \u201cIn Edo, these characters decided to follow a godfather. One of our Comrades, Adams Oshiomhole, led us in the struggle in Edo to say no to godfatherism.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, he removed his khaki and now wears the armor of a godfather. This led to the kind of House of Assembly we now have in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe did everything to beg them; we said you are not representing one godfather you are representing the good people of your constituency. But they refused to come back and be sworn-in. Somebody far away in Lagos, instead was giving them instructions. He said that the governor should issue a second proclamation letter which is against the law. How can somebody from Lagos be dictating for us in Edo? We said no to that, and insisted that Edo people must decide for themselves.\n\nShaibu said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been unable to conduct a bye-election, because the matter was still in the court.\n\nThe deputy governor also advocated for a unicameral legislature to reduce the cost of governance, adding that the funds saved from the restructured legislative system would be used for the development of states.\n\nHe further advocated for state policing, noting that the policing arrangement should be given consideration in the ongoing constitution amendment process so as to check insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the protesters, Abraham Oviawe, said the quest was for all Nigerians to enjoy the dividends of democracy, noting that the present administration has stifled free speech.\n\nHe urged the government to ensure adequate security of lives and property, saying that the Federal Government is paying lip service to the issue of security.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, Nigerians are still suffering as the standard of living has gone from bad to worse in the country. We enjoy freedom of speech but not freedom after speech. Democracy is a reminder to the people the quality of service before them,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

General Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has however hailed the synergy among the various government agencies at the Onne port and charged them not to rest on their oars as they daily work hard to keep Nigeria safe.\n\nHe particularly commended the Commander, officers and men of the Port Harcourt Port Command and their Abuja airport Command counterparts for their vigilance and commitment to the task of ridding Nigeria of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cThe damage 100,000 bottles of codeine would have done to our youths if they had slipped through the port to our villages, towns and cities is unimaginable. 146.95 kilograms of khat could have done the same damage if allowed to go into our streets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to motivate our officers and men so that they can give their best in the discharge of their responsibilities across the country and ultimately with the support of all our stakeholders and partners, we\u2019ll win the battle against illicit drug trafficking and abuse\u201d, Marwa stated.",

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption failure fuelling insecurity, undermining democracy \u2013 Report",
          "text": "A think tank, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), has slammed Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari for not doing enough to combat the endemic corruption in the public service, despite promising to do so during his campaign.\n\nThe group said though Buhari often repeated promise to fight corruption with zero tolerance, the promise has remained \u201clargely unmet\u201d, and the failure fuels Nigeria\u2019s worsening insecurity and undermines democratic promises.\n\n\u201cAs the candidate who rode into office in 2015 on a wave of popular anger with entrenched elite corruption, he has made little effort to reform Nigeria\u2019s patronage-fueled, scandal-prone public sector or hold his top officials accountable for their business-as-usual approach,\u201d CDD said in its report, titled, \u201cBuhari\u2019s Anti-Corruption Record at Six Years: An Assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the 2023 election season already ramping up, and Buhari\u2019s hands-off governing style largely unchanged, his government\u2019s anti-corruption track record is set to go down in history as one characterised by missed opportunities and, in some respects, outright hypocrisy. His 2016 promise to \u201cdemonstrate zero tolerance for corrupt practices\u201d remains largely unmet.\u201d\n\nCDD said, according Premium Times, however, its criticism does not mean the Buhari administration has done nothing in the area of anti-corruption. It then gave an outline, including improved financial centralisation, referring to TSA and IPPIS; and higher conviction rates by anti-corruption agencies. The civic group also praised the president for appointing as a substantive EFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, whom it described as \u201ca dynamic and experienced investigator\u201d.\n\nNotwithstanding, CDD said it noted \u201cseveral significant shortcomings,\u201d including the president\u2019s \u201cwillingness to appoint individuals of questionable integrity to key positions; his tendency to shield political allies from investigation and prosecution; his disinterest in how the ruling party funds its election campaigns; his failure to make key petroleum sector reforms; and his corruption-prone economic and fiscal policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these challenges remain largely unaddressed,\u201d CDD said.\n\n\u201cTwo Pandemics: COVID-19 and Corruption\u201d\n\nIn the name of controlling the spread of COVID-19 and cushioning the effects of the restrictions, CDD said the Buhari administration \u201copaquely\u201d awarded contracts worth N450 million or $1 million to \u201cbriefcase firms\u201d not registered with the Bureau of Public Procurement. It said the emergency spending was disbursed to politically-connected contractors and channeled through existing corrupt structures.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, some government agencies used the pandemic as a pretext to spend lavishly on themselves The Niger Delta Development Commission, for example, disbursed 1.5 billion ($4.2 million) in large cash payments to its own staff members in the name of COVID relief. When questioned by legislators, the Commission\u2019s managing director tried to justify the payments, saying: \u201cwe used it to take care of ourselves\u2026we need to take care of ourselves\u201d,\u201d the think tank said.\n\nCorruption and insecurity\n\nSince Mr Buhari came to power in 2015, insecurity has intensified and spread, affecting virtually all parts of the country. In the north, apart from the Boko Haram in the North-east, armed bandits and terrorists alike are crumbling communities and mass-abducting students at schools in the North-west and North-central zones.\n\nIn the South, herders\u2019 violence has intensified and armed militias of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra are operating, with attacks on INEC and security facilities and personnel and innocent citizens. The separatists were initially unarmed and Nigerian forces under Mr Buhari extra-judicially killed scores of them between 2015 and 2016, a PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 Global Shinning Light Award investigation found.\n\n\u201cHollowed out by strategic- and operational-level corruption, Nigeria\u2019s military and police appear incapable of safeguarding many parts of the country,\u201d CDD said, drawing a link between the problem of corruption and insecurity, \u201cThe normalisation of security sector corruption means that military and police leaders failures\u2019 offer them new opportunities to racketeer and profiteer, as well as embezzle from increased emergency security spending.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cFor Nigeria\u2019s top brass, peace is much less lucrative than perpetual low-intensity conflict. Yet President Buhari has done little to change their calculus, hold them accountable or exert strong oversight over their activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari, security sector corruption has become both a cause and a consequence of rising insecurity across the country. Defence procurement remains as opaque and graft-prone as it did under his predecessor and largely exempt from due process rules designed to prevent corruption.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Backsliding Fuels Corruption\n\nUnder Mr Buhari, the civic space has continued to shrink, CDD said, mentioning violent crackdown on protests and moves to \u201cimpose tighter regulations on legitimate civil society groups while at the same time bankrolling hundreds of fake\u201d NGOs.\n\n\u201c90% of Nigeria\u2019s 360-plus progovernment NGOs have started operating since President Buhari took office, a correlation that suggests many enjoy high-level political support,\u201d CDD claimed.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, ruling party legislators have, in recent years, introduced two bills aimed at regulating NGOs through the creation of a new government agency. If they succeed, the Buhari government may be inclined to use such an agency to target civil society voices that criticise its governance, human rights and corruption record.\u201d\n\nThe think tank expressed pessimism that the president would have the time or political capital to push through sustainable anti-corruption reforms, and called on other stakeholders to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cIntegrity-conscious National Assembly members could, for example, introduce legislation outlawing security votes at the federal, state and local levels. Such a ban should be accompanied by transparent and comprehensive budgeting procedures and criteria for security expenditures that meet international best practices and incorporate robust oversight mechanisms,\u201d CDD recommended.\n\nIt also called on Nigeria\u2019s international partners to prioritise anti-corruption in their engagements and assistance toward the African nation.",

He promotes peace by the policies he makes and we are happy for those policies.

So many names were forwarded but Dr. Emaimo represents a father, a mentor and a great administrator because he has done so much for the Dental College. ASONIS picked him because of his good policies,\u201d Edeh said.\n\nThe student leader cited cases of Emaimo\u2019s resolution of Students\u2019 leadership crises in the college as one of his landmark activities, adding that the rector increased the status of the college from a two-department institution to a college awarding nine higher diplomas and degrees in affiliation with the Federal College of Dental Technology and Therapy, Enugu.\n\n\u201cOur Association picked him because of his good policies because we looked at policies of various institutions. He promotes peace by the policies he makes and we are happy for those policies. We also considered the improvement on campus security which is to Emaimo\u2019s credit,\u201d Edeh said.\n\nReceiving the award, Dr. Emaimo said he was short of words, noting that he did not know that people were watching and taking note of the trends in the college under his watch.\n\nHe described the college as a student friendly institution where both academic and non-academic staff would not have been engaged if students were not there in the first instance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Dr. Emaimo, the college dedicates time to mentoring students and development of manpower for the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis college has transited from awarding Higher Diplomas to the level of degree awards. This is the first federal degree awarding institution in Enugu State and in the future, it becomes only a degree awarding institution and the college is focusing on critical areas of need,\u201d Emaimo said.\n\nHe also noted that the college was not training students that would be useful in Enugu State alone, but also for international service as he dedicated the award to both the students and staff of the college.",

Again the same Buhari he removed from power in 1985 was the one that, 35 years later, and once back in power, apologised for the annulment of his 1993 pres. election & mandate even though he had no hand in it and immortalised his name by declaring June 12th Democracy Day,\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cThis is instructive!

          "text": "Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has sent another open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari regarding the country\u2019s current predicament.\n\nObasanjo urged Buhari\u2019s administration to confront the country\u2019s degree of insecurity and herdsmen crisis and take immediate action before it\u2019s too late.\n\nIf Buhari\u2019s government does not act quickly, four disasters will occur, according to the former President.\n\nAllowing Nigeria to fall into the hands of suspected criminals, retaliatory attacks on Fulanis, attacks on other ethnic groups, and a series of uprisings in various parts of the country are among them.\n\nHe bemoaned the fact that Boko Haram has continued to terrorize Nigeria for more than a decade, including the six years Buhari has been in charge, and said it was a mistake to believe the insurgency battle had been won.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that if quick action is not done, a repeat of the Rwandan genocide might occur in Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo stated that Nigeria\u2019s fundamental problem is corruption, which if not addressed properly will result in a deluge of destruction, violence, calamity, and division.\n\nFull letter to President Buhari\n\nDear President and General Buhari,\n\nI am constrained to write to you this open letter. I decided to make it an open letter because the issue is very weighty and must be greatly worrisome to all concerned Nigerians and that means all right-thinking Nigerians and those resident in Nigeria. Since the issue is of momentous concern to all well-meaning and all right-thinking Nigerians, it must be of great concern to you, and collective thinking and dialoguing is the best way of finding an appropriate and adequate solution to the problem. The contents of this letter, therefore, should be available to all those who can help in proffering effective solutions for the problem of insecurity in the land.\n\nOne of the spinoffs and accelerants is the misinformation and disinformation through the use of fake news. A number of articles, in recent days, have been attributed to me by some people who I believe may be seeking added credence and an attentive audience for their opinions and view-points. As you know very well, I will always boldly own what I say and disown what is put into my mouth. But the issue I am addressing here is very serious; it is the issue of life and death for all of us and for our dear country, Nigeria. This issue can no longer be ignored, treated with nonchalance, swept under the carpet or treated with cuddling glove. The issue is hitting at the foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our Nigerian community. I am very much worried and afraid that we are on the precipice and dangerously reaching a tipping point where it may no longer be possible to hold danger at bay. Without being immodest, as a Nigerian who still bears the scar of the Nigerian civil war on my body and with a son who bears the scar of fighting Boko Haram on his body, you can understand, I hope, why I am so concerned. When people are desperate and feel that they cannot have confidence in the ability of government to provide security for their lives and properties, they will take recourse to anything and everything that can guarantee their security individually and collectively.\n\nFor over ten years, for four of which you have been the captain of the ship, Boko Haram has menacingly ravaged the land and in spite of government\u2019s claim of victory over Boko Haram, the potency and the activities of Boko Haram, where they are active, remain undiminished, putting lie to government\u2019s claim. The recent explanation of the Chief of Army Staff for non-victory due to lack of commitment and lack of motivation on the part of troops bordering on sabotage speaks for itself. Say what you will, Boko Haram is still a daily issue of insecurity for those who are victimised, killed, maimed, kidnapped, raped, sold into slavery and forced into marriage and for children forcibly recruited into carrying bombs on them to detonate among crowds of people to cause maximum destructions and damage. And Boko Haram will not go away on the basis of sticks alone, carrots must overweigh sticks. How else do you deal with issues such as only about 50% literacy in North-East with over 70% unemployment?\n\nHerdsmen/farmers crises and menace started with government treating the issue with cuddling glove instead of hammer. It has festered and spread. Today, it has developed into banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and killings all over the country. The unfortunate situation is that the criminality is being perceived as a \u2018Fulani\u2019 menace unleashed by Fulani elite in the different parts of the country for a number of reasons but even more unfortunately, many Nigerians and non-Nigerians who are friends of Nigeria attach vicarious responsibility to you as a Fulani elite and the current captain of the Nigeria ship. Perception may be as potent as reality at times. Whatever may be the grievances of Fulanis, if any, they need to be put out in the open and their grievances, if legitimate, be addressed; and if other ethnic groups have grievances, let them also be brought out in the open and addressed through debate and dialogue.\n\nThe main issue, if I may dare say, is poor management or mismanagement of diversity which, on the other hand, is one of our greatest and most important assets. As a result, very onerous cloud is gathering. And rain of destruction, violence, disaster and disunity can only be the outcome. Nothing should be taken for granted, the clock is ticking with the cacophony of dissatisfaction and disaffection everywhere in and outside the country. The Presidency and the Congress in the US have signalled to us to put our house in order. The House of Lords in the UK had debated the Nigerian security situation. We must understand and appreciate the significance, implication and likely consequences of such concerns and deliberations.\n\nNo one can stop hate speech, violent agitation and smouldering violent agitation if he fans the embers of hatred, disaffection and violence. It will continue to snowball until it is out of control. A stitch in time saves nine, goes the old wise saying. With the death of Funke, Chief Fasoranti\u2019s daughter, some sympathetic Nigerian groups are saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Prof. Anya, a distinguished Nigerian merit Laureate, has this to say \u201cWe can no longer say with certainty that we have a nation\u201d. Niger-Delta leaders, South-Eastern leaders, Middle-Belt leaders and Northern Elders Forum have not remained quiet. Different ordinary Nigerians at home and abroad are calling for different measures to address or ameliorate the situation. All the calls and cries can only continue to be ignored at the expense of Nigerian unity, if not its continued existence.\n\nTo be explicit and without equivocation, Mr. President and General, I am deeply worried about four avoidable calamities:\n\n1. abandoning Nigeria into the hands of criminals who are all being suspected, rightly or wrongly, as Fulanis and terrorists of Boko Haram type.\n\n2. spontaneous or planned reprisal attacks against Fulanis which may inadvertently or advertently mushroom into pogrom or Rwanda-type genocide that we did not believe could happen and yet it happened.\n\n3. similar attacks against any other tribe or ethnic group anywhere in the country initiated by rumours, fears, intimidation and revenge capable of leading to pogrom.\n\n4. violent uprising beginning from one section of the country and spreading quickly to other areas and leading to dismemberment of the country.\n\nIt happened to Yugoslavia not too long ago. If we do not act now, one or all of these scenarios may happen. We must pray and take effective actions at the same time. The initiative is in the hands of the President of the nation, but he cannot do it alone. In my part of the world, if you are sharpening your cutlass and a mad man comes from behind to take the cutlass from you, you need other people\u2019s assistance to have your cutlass back without being harmed. The mad men with serious criminal intent and terrorism as core value have taken cutlass of security. The need for assistance to regain control is obviously compelling and must be embraced now.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at a public lecture, I had said, among other things, that:\n\n\u201cIn all these issues of mobilisation for national unity, stability, security, cooperation, development, growth and progress, there is no consensus. Like in the issue of security, government should open up discussion, debate and dialogue as part of consultation at different levels and the outcome of such deliberations should be collated to form inputs into a national conference to come up with the solution that will effectively deal with the issues and lead to rapid development, growth and progress which will give us a wholesome society and enhanced living standard and livelihood in an inclusive and shared society. It will be a national programme. We need unity of purpose and a nationally accepted strategic roadmap that will not change with the whims and caprices of any government. It must be owned by the citizens, people\u2019s policy and strategy implemented by the government no matter it\u2019s color and leaning.\n\nSome of the groups that I will suggest being contacted are traditional rulers, past heads of service (no matter how competent or incompetent they have been and how much they have contributed to the mess we are in), past heads of paramilitary organizations, private sector, civil society, community leaders particularly in the most affected areas, present and past governors, present and past local government leaders, religious leaders, past Heads of State, past intelligence chiefs, past Heads of Civil Service and relevant current and retired diplomats, members of the opposition and any groups that may be deemed relevant.\u201d\n\nThe President must be seen to be addressing this issue with utmost seriousness and with maximum dispatch and getting all hands on deck to help. If there is a failure, the principal responsibility will be that of the President and no one else. We need cohesion and concentration of effort and maximum force \u2013 political, economic, social, psychological, and military \u2013 to deal successfully with the menace of criminality and terrorism separately and together. Blame game among own forces must be avoided. It is debilitating and only helpful to our adversary. We cannot dither anymore. It is time to confront this threat headlong and in a manner that is holistic, inclusive, and purposeful.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians, I pray that God may grant you, as our President, the wisdom, the understanding, the political will, and the courage to do what is right when it is right and without fear or favor. May God save, secure, protect and bless Nigeria. May He open to us a window of opportunity that we can still use to prevent the worst from happening. As we say in my village, \u201cMay God forbid bad thing\u201d.\n\nsigned\n\nOLUSEGUN OBASANJO",

          "text": "Former governor of Edo State and One-time National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, John Odigie Oyegun, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the ruling party not to wait till agitations from different sections of the country on restructuring snowball into a threat to national unity before addressing them.\n\nThe party chieftain said the earlier those issues are addressed the easier it is to diffuse the tensions currently building across the country.\n\nOyegun, who stated this at the public presentation of a book titled \u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u201d written by the director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGD) Mallam Salihu Moh. Lukman, stressed that the APC as the government of the federation, \u201cmust not give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that it is in fact, mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subjectto become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\n\n\u201cSo, the earlier we address it, the earlier we show that as a party we are responsive to the feelings of the people, the desires of the people and the wants of the people. \u201d It becomes easier then to diffuse the kind of stresses that the nation is passing through today. Look at what is happening. Well, it is recommended there should be State Police.\u201d\n\nOn the need to rebuild the APC from bottom to the top approach, Chief Oyegun warned against bending the party\u2019s rules.\n\n\u201cYou can stretch the rule. Never break it. Secondly, it is very fundamental that in all we do, the ranks-and-file members of the party and of parties generally, are able to see that even when they lose, they have been treated fairly, they have been treated decently because what I observed, I was made the Chairman of the reconciliation group in the South-south and in every single case, you have a situation where during elections, the civil war within the party alone, makes it impossible to think of it. Why is it civil war? Civil war because critical stakeholders in the party see that they have not been fairly, justly treated.\u201d\n\nFor the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi state governor, Atiku Bagudu, said the APC is awared that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed and it will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cThe party is not shy to acknowledge that our constitution is not perfect and again under John Oyegun, the El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism was created to look at those issues that we should do better about. APC believe is let us amend constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better, I believe the proposal which have been submitted to the National Assembly will help to produce amended Constitution that will meet most of the aspirations.\n\nIn her goodwill message, the mother of day and a former Nigerian envoy, Fatima Balla Abubakar, who said APC\u2019s popularity can be attributed, significantly, to President Muhammadu Buhari, called on the government to quickly address the growing social unrest for the party to regain confidence.\n\n\u201cAs the party in power which also has control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the APC must redouble its efforts to regain public confidence and trust which have been eroded in these deeply trying times. We cannot regain public confidence in our party as well as the government if we do not seriously address the growing social unrest due to growing mistrust between citizens main|y induced by poverty, lack ofjobs and livelihood. It is only when trust is rebuilt that we can restore peace.\n\n\u201cAs a government in power, APC needs to start thinking and doing things differently so that it can begin to deploy more people oriented policies to boost socio-economic growth and development and to provide more relief to the people.\n\n\u201cThe present situation in the country calls for more robust intellectual and policy oriented discussions and engagements by our party. We must engage with a spirit of transparency and inclusiveness. We must create a big tent where different views and positions are discussed without bitterness.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the APC government for his opportunity to serve, the author of the book, Salihu Moh. Lukman, said APC leaders have been working to address some of the foundational issues of democracy and that the book \u201cis a contribution to support initiatives of our leaders. All leaders and members of APC are therefore invited to engage challenges facing the party, government and the nation with every confidence and belief in the capacity of Nigerians to support every patriotic and nationalistic initiative. We much never allow the loud noise of selfish political entrepreneurs to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that our party and governments produced by our party have failed.\n\n\u201cIt will be a mockery of our political history to allow any narrative in the public space, which suggest that comparative to previous administrations since 1999, APC controlled administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari has failed. Like President Muhammadu Buhari himself has acknowledged, there are no doubt challenges facing the country, but no administration since 1999 has succeeded in completing projects, whether initiated by previous or current governments.\n\n\u201cJust on Thursday, June 10, 2021, President Buhari commissioned the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway, a project started and completed by his administration. And because leaders of PDP are shameless, they had the temerity to make a public statement calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to \u2018stop taking credit for projects not initiated by him.\u2019 May be they also want President Buhari and APC to acquire all their scandalous records, which include abandoning the construction of the PDP National Secretariat after mobilising billions on Naira.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026says conflict between executive, legislature not in the interest of Nigerians\n\nSenate president Ahmad Lawan has said that the National Assembly won\u2019t hesitate to issue a warrant of arrest on any government official that refuses to appear before its Committees to account for public funds in their trust.\n\nLawan made this known while fielding questions at a briefing of Editors, Bureau Chiefs and members of the Senate Press Corps to mark the 2nd anniversary of the ninth Senate in Abuja.\n\nThe Senate President was reacting against the backdrop of likely concerns into findings by the Public Accounts Committee on the report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the accounts of the Federation for the year ended 31st December, 2015.\n\nThe report was laid on Tuesday this week by the Public Accounts Committee Chairman, Matthew Urhoghide (PDP, Edo South) during plenary.\n\nLawan said, \u201cThe Public Accounts Committee normally works with the report of the Auditor-General for the Federation.\n\n\u201c[And] the report of the Auditor-General is an annual report. Normally, report infractions where an agency was given money, there was expenditure that the Auditor-General could not understand, he will give thirty days for that organization to come and explain.\n\n\u201cIf the agency does not come forward in thirty days to give an explanation, that issue is put in the Auditor-General\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cIt is not a final indictment, so to speak. The Public Accounts Committee is supposed to invite the agency to come and explain what the Auditor-General is reporting.\n\n\u201c[And] I\u2019m sure that our public accounts committee has been doing its best. Where an agency refuses to appear, we normally have some other ways of maybe after three invitations to appear, then we go for the warrant of arrest.\n\n\u201cI served as as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for eight years, and I had the benefit of getting my Senate President to sign warrant of arrest of some people who felt they were so big. [And] at the end of the day, they ran all over the place looking for soft landing.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President emphasised: \u201cWe will not hesitate to sign warrant of arrest on anyone who refuses or fails to appear to account for public funds in his or her trust. We will not hesitate.\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you, that majority of public servants invited to come before the committees of the National Assembly appear, only few sometimes fail to appear.\n\n\u201cNow, those few, if we judge their absence to be defiance, we will take the appropriate action.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the relationship between the legislature and the executive arm of government in the last two years, the Senate President dismissed insinuations that the National Assembly is a \u201crubber stamp\u201d of the executive.\n\nAccording to him, the ninth assembly\u2019s resolve to collaborate with the executive arm of government owed to its decision to work patriotically in the interest of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that a frosty relationship between both arms of government as previously characterised in past assemblies had time and again failed work in the overall interest of Nigerians as they always are the losers.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the executive and legislature between 1999 and 2003 was largely characterized by mostly fight and total lack of coordination and collaboration.\n\n\u201cBut who paid the price? Nigerians paid the price because government could not function.\n\n\u201cThe legislature must have its pride of place. In fact, in the constitution, the first arm of government mentioned is the legislature before the executive arm, then the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe legislature is even the senior partner in government, if I may say so. But what is important is for the legislature to know its mandate and obligations to understand that it has an oversight function over the executive arm of government and even the judiciary, to uphold separation of powers between the various arms of government.\n\n\u201c[And] if it knows that, it means it knows its boundaries. The executive should also have its boundaries because these are clearly defined roles.\n\n\u201cIn 2019 when we campaigned, we said when we are given the opportunity to serve in this capacity, we want to establish a working relationship based on mutual respect, cooperation, consultation, synergy and partnership with the executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cNot at the expense of our roles as the legislature, but we believe that we can get better outcome in terms of government delivering services to the citizens of this country. That is what informed our position.\n\n\u201c[But] it appears that what some people expect from a legislature, or a relationship between the two arms \u2013 the legislature and the executive \u2013 is stone throwing, fights, insults, punching and so on.\n\n\u201cThat legislature that does that is the kind of legislature we (Nigerians) want. How does that give you what you need? It doesn\u2019t give you what we need.\n\n\u201cI can tell you we disagree with the executive, but the difference between us and what might have happened previously is that we are able to sit down and talk and say no, we are not accepting this one, you should withdraw it.\u201d\n\nReacting to the recent ban of Twitter by the Federal Government of Nigeria, Lawan expressed optimism that the engagement between Nigeria and Twitter would resolve the contentious dispute.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe Honourable Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, informed Nigerians that they are talking with Twitter to resolve this matter.\n\n\u201c[And] our belief is, Nigeria needs Twitter just as much as Twitter needs Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that this engagement between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Twitter would resolve the dispute between Twitter and our government.\n\n\u201c[But] beyond that, I\u2019m an optimist. I believe that all of us would have learnt our lessons.\u201d",

          "text": "Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has condemned the renewed communal clashes between the people of Enyibichiri, Izzi in Abakaliki Local Government Area and Echialike, Ikwo, Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi state over a lingered land dispute, demanding an end to the hostility.\n\nThe Ebonyi indigenes also condemned in totality the abduction of some Izzi children by fighters alleged to be from the Echi-Alike area.\n\nIn a statement released to newsmen Sunday in Abuja by its President worldwide, Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed concerns over the attacks on lives and property by natives of the two communities who he said have remained peaceful and peace-loving brothers of the same Ekumenyi progenitor.\n\n\u201cThough we had condemned this renewed hostilities, we find this latest news of abduction of under-aged children most perturbing. As parents, we cannot imagine how traumatized their wards and parents must have been since the ugly news of their abduction broke.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge therefore that the anger over the latest development on the crisis must have necessitated the reported attacks on Ikwo natives even in the Abakaliki capital city and the heightening apprehension over reprisal attacks that have since pervaded the two popular clans. As at the last count, we scooped that some prominent Ikwo natives have deserted the capital city to some other parts of the region and the country while those who may not afford the luxury of traveling that far have relocated to their Ikwo communities.\n\n\u201cAESID is worried and tempted to again, demand that the world must blame Umahi\u2019s reprehensible laxity for not nipping this ugly incident in the bud not only as the Chief Security Officer of the State but also as one who is known for playing politics with every damn affair or issue in the state.\n\n\u201cWe therefore hope and challenge the Governor who has always threatened to incite wars against brothers as part of his political strategies to deal with his opponents and those he consider enemies, to come out boldly and deny the fingers pointing at him that it is possible he may have deployed his usual style of cutting the trees in the bush and at the same time rushing out of the road to ask; who is behind the wood-cutting in the bush?\n\n\u201cWe feel that if this is not what we think it is: dealing with the opposition by other means, why has the Governor been reportedly threatening some PDP Lawmakers and other stakeholders of the party arrested to either declare for the APC or remain in detention? Some of them like the House of Assembly Majority leader, Engr. Humphrey Nwuruku who had been held in detention over the crises for several days, we authoritatively learnt have evidence of a chat message from the Governor and his allies giving his defection to the APC as a condition for his release from detention.\u201d\n\nWhile wondering now a once-peaceful state has become a spectacle of communal wars since Umahi came to power in 2015, the group said the situation was getting worse since January 22nd when the Effium killings started.\n\n\u201cFrom attacks between indigenous Effium natives Versus Ezza-Effium in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi North to Iyionu in Ishielu in Ebonyi Central and Ikwo Versus Izzi in the same Central Senatorial zone to Ishinkwo Ukawu versus Abaomege (who are still Ekumenyi brothers) in Ebonyi South, is it not reasonable to suspect that these could all be part of the desperate antics of Governor Umahi to make sure that the Umuekumenyi brothers does not have a common voice when they go into elections in 2023?\n\n\u201cAlready, some political pundits have also wondered why it is Ikwo which has the largest political wards in the State with as much as 20 political wards of any LGA in the State and the Izzi that is one of the clans with largest number of voters that would suddenly be up in arms against one another. When will Umahi return our beloved state to the peaceful path he met it and end these persistent bloodsheds?\n\n\u201cWe conclude by demanding the immediate release of the reportedly abducted kids and asking leaders of thoughts from Umuekumenyi to convoke an extraordinary, apolitical stakeholders meeting which shall involve all youths and key stakeholders to address these challenges and embrace peaceful co-existence among one another. We feel they would be the greatest losers to go into any form of war with each other when it is even now that they need each other most.\n\n\u201cThey should therefore prove their enemies and traducers wrong by not only amicably resolving this dispute but ensure that going forward, they would be no love lost between and among brothers of the same Ekumenyi progenitor. This, AESID believes is the best way to go for any meaningful development to be initiated and sustained in their local communities.\u201d",
          "summary": "Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has condemned the renewed communal clashes between the people of Enyibichiri, Izzi in Abakaliki Local Government Area and Echialike, Ikwo, Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi state over a lingered land dispute, demanding an end to the hostility.\nThe Ebonyi indigenes also condemned in totality the abduction of some Izzi children by fighters alleged to be from the Echi-Alike area.\n\u201cThough we had condemned this renewed hostilities, we find this latest news of abduction of under-aged children most perturbing.\nWhen will Umahi return our beloved state to the peaceful path he met it and end these persistent bloodsheds?\nThis, AESID believes is the best way to go for any meaningful development to be initiated and sustained in their local communities.\u201d",

As a result, we have been able to shift our violent narratives to ones of optimism and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, things suddenly took a dramatic turn, and things are getting worse by the day. It is clear that some invincible hands are plotting evil against our people with the goal of making our State as terrifying as it were in the years gone by. My constant prayer is for Allah to reveal those who are perpetrating these cruel atrocities against our people.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Governor urged communities to defend themselves against the bandits while pledging his administration\u2019s commitment to securing the state.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we will remain steadfast in our efforts to eradicate banditry and all types of criminality from the State,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this battle, no sacred cow. Whosoever is involved in these dastardly acts, no matter how highly placed, would be dealt with according to the law.\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated this commitment based on the actions we have taken in respect of Emir of Maru, Emir of Dansadau and, following yesterday\u2019s incident, the Emir of Zurmi.\n\n\u201cMy administration has resolved to begin implementing the recommendations of the MD Abubakar-led Committee on Finding Solutions to Banditry in Zamfara State as a next step in addressing this vexing problem.

          "text": "Nigerian-born Israel Adesanya was back to his brilliant best Saturday, defeating challenger Marvin Vettori with a show of superior striking and defending his middleweight title at UFC 263 in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nIt was a masterful return to form for the New Zealander on a wild night at the Gila River Arena that also saw the UFC crown its first-ever Mexican-born champion.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel any threat at all,\u201d said Adesanya, 31, after getting a comfortable unanimous decision.\n\nAdesanya suffered the first loss of his MMA career in March after moving up a division and finding himself outmuscled.\n\nBut Saturday saw him down to a weight class where he is noticeably more comfortable. The Nigerian-born fighter\u2019s speed around the cage and his precision striking, with low kicks and jabs, was too much for Vettori from the first bell.\n\nThe Italian tried to use his bigger bulk to get Adesanya to the mat, but each time the New Zealander slipped out and got up to his feet again.\n\nIn the end, the judges\u2019 cards read 50-45, 50-45, 50-45 \u2013- and Adesanya was back in business, describing himself as \u201cthe king.\u201d\n\nThere were questions before the fight about the mental toll on Adesanya of his career\u2019s first defeat, and of the death last month of one of his close friends who was attacked on a night out in Auckland.\n\nAdesanya dedicated the fight to his friend and laid his belt down in the middle of the cage in tribute.\n\nBefore Adesanya\u2019s masterclass, the 18,000-odd fans in attendance raised the roof when flyweight challenger Brandon Moreno laid on a rear-naked choke in the third round that saw Brazil\u2019s Deiveson Figueiredo first tap out and then hand over his belt to the Mexican.\n\nDespite his nation\u2019s storied history across all combat sports, there has never before been a Mexican UFC champion and the 27-year-old Moreno broke down in tears as he spoke in the cage afterwards.\n\n\u201cThis moment is so amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life for this. Viva Mexico!\u201d\n\nThe pair had thrown up one of the fights of the year when they met at UFC 256 last December, across five rounds of mayhem that was called a majority draw.\n\nThis time around, Moreno left nothing to chance, moving with speed and purpose at a high tempo.\n\nSaturday night continued the UFC\u2019s rollout of live events for American fans as the United States emerges from pandemic lockdowns that shut down most action for a year.\n\nThe UFC described the Arizona event as a sellout, much like the open-to-the-public events in Jacksonville, Florida, and Houston, Texas.",

          "text": "Israel Adesanya got back to his winning ways on Sunday with an outstanding five-round showing in the UFC 263 main event\n\nMarvin Vettori believed he won his 2018 clash with Adesanya and never stopped calling for a rematch with the man who would go on to become UFC middleweight champion. Vettori got his rematch on Saturday night in the main event of UFC 263 and came up empty, with Adesanya taking a clear decision victory at Gila River Arena in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nVettori had only a few successful moments in the fight, scoring with a handful of takedowns, but Adesanya showcased improved grappling skills as he escaped back to his feet every time, including spinning out of a rear-naked choke attempt to end up in top position. Outside of those fleeting moments for Vettori, the fight was all Adesanya as he worked Vettori over with a steady diet of leg kicks.\n\nThose leg kicks took the explosiveness out of Vettori\u2019s takedown attempts, leaving him to spend much of the championship rounds leaning forward, clinging to Adesanya\u2019s legs while not being able to put the fight back on the ground. This drew taunts from Adesanya and boos from the crowd.\n\nEven with the fight clearly having gone Adesanya\u2019s way, after the final horn, the two briefly exchanged words, with Vettori claiming to have done enough to win the fight.\n\nIn the end, Adesanya took every round on all three official scorecards, winning by scores of 50-45 across the board. Adesanya has now successfully defended the 185-pound championship three times and rebounded from a loss in his previous fight, an attempt to become a two-division champion when he went to light heavyweight to face 205-pound champion Jan Blachowicz.\n\nAfter his victory, Adesanya called for a rematch with Robert Whittaker, the man he defeated to become champion.\n\n\u201cWhittaker, my arch-nemesis, Bobby,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the f\u2014 is gonna happen with COVID.

          "text": "According to Mr Okung owing to the unstable current global economic environment, the fate of the Nigerian economy lies in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people.\n\nThe NFL star had asked the Nigerian government to adopt a national bitcoin standard or risk falling behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\nTwitter CEO and billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey, is extremely bullish on the future of bitcoin in Nigeria. He says Nigerians will lead bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. \u201cThe people of Nigeria will lead #bitcoin \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cThe hope of Nigeria lies within this generation. I am proudly a Nigerian descendant living in America and am a proponent of Bitcoin. I write to urge the Nigerian government to pursue economic independence and financial sovereignty by pursuing a national Bitcoin standard. Soon every nation will be faced with this decision, but those who seize the present moment proactively as we have just witnessed in El Salvador, will enjoy significant advantages globally for generations to come.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the current global economic environment is worrisome and unsustainable. Sadly, the fate of the Nigerian economy is in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people. Despite the challenges we face, the resilience of Nigerians continues to inspire. The Nigerian society enjoys more favorable conditions than many of its neighbors. However, even greater opportunity awaits with the adoption of national action in favor of a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cThe tone of this letter is meant to convey urgency both in terms of the forthcoming economic despair and the limited window to act on this opportunity with fierce boldness and strong leadership. While the challenges of COVID-19 and increased global unrest continue to instill fear in the hearts and minds of citizens everywhere, Nigerians can claim international greatness by rising to the occasion that our unique times require.\n\n\u201cNations such as Iran, Russia, China and Kenya have been reportedly mining or otherwise utilizing bitcoin, often as a means to circumvent U.S. sanctions which prevent them from full participation in the global financial system. Other nations like Barbados, Singapore and Malta have moved to become \u201cbitcoin friendly\u201d in an effort to attract wealth and human capital through migration. And this week, El Salvador became the world\u2019s first nation to require merchants to accept bitcoin as legal tender. I\u2019m proposing an equally aggressive approach to national Bitcoin adoption which would significantly bolster every sector of the Nigerian economy and revitalize the spirit of every Nigerian domestically and abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the letter the NFL star says what\u2019s needed for the Nigerian economy to be reshaped is bold leadership with clear vision for a new future as the country does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not controlled, managed or operated by any single entity. It is an innovation that will surpass the automobile or the internet in terms of its impact on humanity. Nigeria does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin. All that is required is a vision for a new future and an allocation of its own national resources to pursue a Bitcoin standard,\u201d Mr Okung told the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for urgently pursuing and executing a national plan for adoption is the finite supply of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in circulation. This hard cap on the supply makes bitcoin even more verifiably finite than gold. As this simple yet unique property of scarcity becomes more widely understood, the economic laws of supply and demand will create a global frenzy to acquire as much bitcoin as possible, before it\u2019s too late. This momentum for acquiring bitcoin is already underway throughout the world and it is rapidly accelerating. In recent months, continued economic turmoil and uncertainty has created increased curiosity in bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMultiple institutional investors have announced sizable bitcoin allocations in their portfolios, some citing it as a hedge against a weakening U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government, along with every other government in the world, has a once in a generation opportunity to claim global prominence by rising to the occasion. Many other politicians in Latin America have signalled their intention to pursue similar moves as El Salvador.\n\n\u201cIn leading the next global financial shift, Nigeria can create prosperity for its citizens in a manner that requires no bloodshed, no election and no resistance. Such a proposition may seem too good to be true, and these ambitions certainly require thorough investigation, scrutiny and debate. Conversely, a delay in pursuing a national plan for bitcoin adoption will risk a scenario where Nigeria is left behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\n\u201cAs world leaders become more aware of the chance to make history, pursuit of bitcoin will be widespread. We offer our full support, a willingness to voluntarily consult and commitment to activate every resource available to us in order to see Nigeria pursue a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cNigeria must never carry last.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Two civil society organisations \u2013 Global Rights and Tap Initiative for Citizens Development have applied to the African Commission on Human and People\u2019s Rights in Banjul, the Gambia to invalidate the Twitter ban by the Nigerian government and any measures or steps taken to implement the ban.\n\nThe groups also asked the commission to issue an order directing the federal government to afford just satisfaction to them by way of damages for the losses suffered by them in consequence of the ban.\n\nFurther, they asked the commission to hold that Nigeria, by imposing a ban on the use of Twitter has violated Nigerians\u2019 right to freedom of expression as provided for by the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nNigeria is a state party to the Charter, having deposited its instrument of ratification of the Charter on 22 July 1983.\n\nThe Charter is also part of Nigeria\u2019s law having been domesticated by the African Charter (Ratification and Enforcement) Act of 1983.\n\nThe applicants therefore asked the commission to declare that the twitter ban ordered on June 4, 2021 amounted to internet shutdown or disruption incompatible with the charter.\n\nThey prayed the commission to declare that the ban and the threat to prosecute anyone using Twitterviolate Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 22 and 26 of the charter.\n\nOther reliefs sought by the applicants are: A declaration that the threat of the federal government issued on or about 5 June, 2021, to prosecute all or any users of Twitter within its territory is an abuse of power, which has a chilling effect on and violates the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Articles 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 17 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nA declaration that the order issued by the Respondent State on or about 7 June, 2021, to all media houses to deactivate their Twitter handles and stop tweeting violates Articles 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 and 17of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nA declaration that the failure of the Respondent State to maintain the courts and keep them open since 6 April 2021, is a denial of the right of the applicants to local remedies and violates Articles 1 and 26 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nA declaration that by reason of the violations aforesaid, the Respondent State is in violation of its obligations under Article 1 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nThere are hurdles the applicants must scale before the commission can hear their application, one of which is that they must have exhausted local remedies before approaching the commission.\n\nTo scale these hurdles, the applicants argued that as at the time they filed the communication, courts in Nigeria were shut as a result of the strike embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 100 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the applicants prayed the commission for provisional measures against Nigeria pending the determination of the communication.\n\nOne of such measures asked for by the applicants is for the commission to stop the federal government from arresting or prosecuting them, their staff, personnel or associates or taking any steps to impair their rights of on grounds of their use of Twitter pending the determination of the present complaint or the lifting of the ban on Twitter by Nigeria.\n\nThey also asked the commission to refer the complaint against Nigeria to the African Court on Humanand Peoples\u2019 Rights for determination.\n\nNigeria deposited with the Commission of the African Union its instrument of ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the Establishment of the African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on 9 June, 2004 (hereafter called \u201cthe African Court Protocol\u201d.\n\nHowever, Nigerian citizens cannot file a case directly at the African Court on Human and People\u2019s Rights, because Nigeria has not made a declaration under Article 34(6) of the African Court\u2019s Protocol accepting the competence of the court to receive cases from individuals and non governmental organisations.\n\nBut the applicants claimed that Internet disruptions violated the right to receive information and freeexpression (Article 9(1)-(2)), the right to freedom of association (Article 10), and right to freedom of assembly (Article 11).\n\nAccording to them, freedom from censorship, including freedom from blocking or filtering of the Internet, is central for the exercise of freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cThe right of access to information (Article 9(1)) is also an important part of th right to freedom of expression, as it is needed in order to build opinions and express them. Blocking, filtering and censorship, plus the possibility of criminal prosecution, limit access to information and stifle online debate. State manipulation of the information that citizens are permitted to see (and not see) online also impedes the right of access to accurate information\u201d, they added.\n\nThe applicants argued further that disrupting access to the Internet services hinders the full enjoyment of a wide range of fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the right Articles 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13(1) and 16 of the African Charter.\n\nThey said: \u201cThe Twitter ban adversely impacts on ordinary lives by preventing people fromcommunicating, harming businesses and livelihoods. In practical terms, it impacts most adversely on the poorest people, who are less able to afford alternative or more costly means of communication thereby creating unjustifiable discrimination, promoting inequality, and unlawfully impinging on the dignity of persons contrary to Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nIn its resolution on the Right to Freedom of Information and Expression on the Internet in Africa, the commission recognises the role of the Internet in advancing human and peoples\u2019 rights in Africa.\n\nThe applicants argued that, \u201cThe current ban on Twitter in Nigeria clearly contravenes the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, issued by this honorable commission, according to which \u2018States shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receiveand impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\u201d\n\nTobi Soniyi",

General Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has however hailed the synergy among the various government agencies at the Onne port and charged them not to rest on their oars as they daily work hard to keep Nigeria safe.\n\nHe particularly commended the Commander, officers and men of the Port Harcourt Port Command and their Abuja airport Command counterparts for their vigilance and commitment to the task of ridding Nigeria of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cThe damage 100,000 bottles of codeine would have done to our youths if they had slipped through the port to our villages, towns and cities is unimaginable. 146.95 kilograms of khat could have done the same damage if allowed to go into our streets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to motivate our officers and men so that they can give their best in the discharge of their responsibilities across the country and ultimately with the support of all our stakeholders and partners, we\u2019ll win the battle against illicit drug trafficking and abuse\u201d, Marwa stated.\n\nChristopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said the Nigerian government cannot afford the amount of funding needed to revive the country\u2019s educational system. Buhari also said the competition for funds had become keener because of the recent increase in the number of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nThe president spoke on Saturday at the 49th convocation ceremony of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He said the financial situation had been worsened by the global economic downturn, which also affected the national revenue.\n\nBuhari, who was represented at the ceremony by the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, however, said his administration was committed to addressing the needs of tertiary institutions through budgetary allocations to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that the on-going drive to diversify the national economy will provide the government with additional resources to improve funding for the education system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the universities should also leverage other funding sources, such as from alumni, friends, the private sector, institutional linkages, and research grants, to attract additional revenue for infrastructure, research, and development.\n\n\u201cWe must also address the problems of poor work ethics and the albatross of prolonged and recurrent industrial actions by staff of universities,\u201d the president stated.\n\nBuhari advised academic institutions across the country to embark on the kind of innovative research that could help boost production and diversify the economy.\n\n\u201cOur universities must continue to emphasise training in entrepreneurship so school leavers and graduates are able to become job creators instead of perennial job seekers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, said the government should make effort to address the perennial challenge of poverty and inequality in the country or risk losing the youth to crime. Amaechi, who delivered the 49th convocation lecture of the university, stated that the series of protests held across the country of late, such as #ENDSARS, were as a result of increasing poverty and disaffection on the part of the citizens.\n\n\u201cAlthough, the current administration has introduced a number of programmes to help eradicate poverty, such as Transport Track for individuals who were into the transportation business, several Nigerians are yet to be lifted out of poverty,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe stated that policies should be focused on the rural majority, and targeted at giving the citizens a good life and lifting them out of poverty.",
