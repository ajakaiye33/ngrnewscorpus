          "text": "The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria says it has begun the replacement and repair of aged equipment used to carry out its daily operations at the airports across the country.\n\nThe Managing Director, FAAN, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu, made this known at an interactive session with the League and Airports Aviation Correspondents in Lagos on Wednesday.\n\nYadudu said some of the equipment such as the baggage landing, runway and the central cooling system among others were more than 40 years old and above.\n\nHe said that FAAN had inaugurated an ad hoc committee in 2021 because it saw that most of the facilities were aged.\n\nHe said that these equipment were supposed to be replaced every 15 years, but some had gone 25 to 30 years.\n\n\u201cThe major repair is of ageing equipment and components. I gave you an example in Lagos; abandoned runway and airfield lighting. Also, the key elements at the MMA (Murtala Muhammed Airport) and any other airports that we did not replace, but now, we are replacing them.\n\n\u201cSome were last replaced in either 1980 or 1985. Now, we are replacing them. It is only the air-conditioning system that we have not yet procured, but we are processing it and the airfield lighting.\n\n\u201cHowever, all other basic ones such as disabled aircraft, baggage handling and other basic ones that the people see every day, we have started with them. The avio bridges, we have started with them and that is in terms of infrastructure.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a committee that is working and they gave us the state-of-the-art equipment for all the airports so that we can make use of it, work with the ministry and use it to know their status so that we can plan.\n\n\u201cThis year, we will work in Akure, Borno, Sokoto and next year, we will work in Port Harcourt, Benin and Yola. We don\u2019t have all the money to fix all, but we will do the entire airports gradually,\u201d he said.\n\nYadudu, while responding on plans to start 24-hour operations of the airports, said, \u201cFAAN cannot operate an airport that it cannot break even, because it is already challenged, it can only operate 24 hours airport if it knows that the business can be sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe managing director also sympathised with the domestic airlines on the scarcity of Jet A1, saying that if anything affected the airlines, it would definitely affect FAAN and every other thing or organisation.\n\n\u201cFAAN is working actively with the airlines with the NCAA DG, there will be some positive actions from the government soon on Jet A1 availability,\u201d he said.\n\nYadudu also said that the relocation to the new terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport would be done in phases.\n\n\u201cI told airlines that operate morning and afternoon flights to move to the new terminal so that we will decongest the old terminal.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that some of them said they will not move, but FAAN is not ready to compel them to move.\n\n\u201cThey were complaining of the bad facilities and the baggage handling, now, FAAN has provided them with a new one, yet, they refused to move,\u201d he said.\n\nNAN",

          "title": "Cultural group marks five years promoting Yoruba ideals",
          "text": "A group, Atelewo Cultural Initiative, on Wednesday, celebrated the fifth anniversary of promoting the Yoruba language and culture.\n\nThe group advocated the promotion of indigenous practices as a response to the myriads of challenges and threats facing the preservation and survival of the Yoruba culture and language.\n\nIn a press statement issued by its co-founders, Rasaq Malik and Ibrahim Oreola, they noted that a majority of Nigerians and Africans at large were beginning to draw back on reading and writing in their indigenous African languages, adding that this was not also helped by education policies that did not mandate students to learn an African language up to the secondary school level and the waning presence of quality literature materials in these languages.\n\n\u201cOn June 1, 2017, we started A\u0300T\u1eb8\u0301L\u1eb8W\u1ecc\u0301 Cultural Initiative as a response to the myriads of challenges and threats facing the preservation and survival of the Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 culture and language.\n\n\u201cWe started the initiative \u0301to solve some of these problems by making it a platform dedicated to the reviving and repositioning of the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 culture with the mission to provide a platform for stoking interest and generating fulfilling engagements with the dynamics of the Yoru\u0300ba \u0301culture through competitions, lectures, dialogues, and regular meetups; to provide a platform for the documentation and preservation of Yoru\u0300ba \u0301ancient knowledge, culture, and language in keeping pace with technological advancement; and to rekindle people\u2019s interest in Yoruba literature by organising readings, making Yoruba \u0301literature accessible and publishing new voices in the Yoru\u0300ba \u0301language.\n\n\u201cFor five years, we have consulted and provided valuable support, insights, and advocacies for various Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 projects and initiatives nationally and internationally. For five years, we have provided a platform for culture and language enthusiasts to engage in rich dialogues about issues relating to and affecting the Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 people,\u201d the statement partly read.\n\nAtelewo listed its achievements between 2017 and 2022 which had helped to promote the aims and objectives of the initiative, to include its prize for Yoruba literature, which would also take place in 2023.\n\nAtelewo prize for Yoruba literature\n\n\u201cIn line with our goals and objectives, Atelewo launched the annual \u201c\u00c0T\u1eb8L\u1eb8W\u1ecc\u0301\u0301 PRIZE FOR YOR\u00d9B\u00c1 LITERATURE\u201d in 2020. The competition is open to previously unpublished writers working in the Yoru\u0300ba language. It is instituted to address some of the problems\u2013committed publishers, distribution, cultivating invested readerships, etc.\u2013that creative writing in Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 faces. The \u00c0TEL\u0301E\u0323W\u0301\u0323O\u0301 PRIZE\u0323 FOR YOR\u00d9B\u00c1 LITERATURE intends to rejuvenate the more than the century-old, vibrant, universally praised, and unquestionably rich Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 literary culture.\n\n\u201cFor the first edition, entries were opened for writers to submit to poetry, prose, and drama categories. After the keenly contested competition, we had a total of five winners. Mustapha Sherif emerged as the overall winner for his manuscript \u201cOrin Ewi\u0300 Ak\u1ecddan\u201d. Other winners are \u1e62eun Ade\u0301ja\u0300re (T\u2019\u1eb9ni\u0301ku\u0301 Lo\u0301 gbe\u0301), Amos \u1eccla\u0301tu\u0301nji\u0301 Po\u0301po\u0301\u1ecdla\u0301 (Aki\u0301nkanju\u0301 \u1eccd\u1eb9 Ni\u0301nu\u0301 Igbo\u0301 A\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301ku\u0300n), Sodiq Lawal (Koo\u0301we\u0300 N\u0301 ke\u0301e\u0301), Agbo\u1ecdla\u0301 A\u0300ya\u0301ndi\u0300ran (O\u0301 Ja\u0301 S\u1ecd\u0301p\u1eb9\u0301). The overall winner received a cash prize of 50,000 Naira while the rest of the winners received plaques and book prizes.\n\n\u201cFor the second edition, we added a new category called \u201cTranslation\u201d for entries that translated works in other languages to the Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 language. And at the end of the process, we equally had five winners. Waliyullah Tunde Abiimbola emerged as the overall winner for his manuscript, Oko \u1eb8ranko, a Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 translation of George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d. Other winners are Kafilah Ay\u1ecd\u0300ba\u0301mi Fashola (A\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300ni\u0301), Ba\u0301ka\u0301re\u0300 Wahab Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300 (Atewolara Akewi-Akowe), Ani\u0301fowo\u0301\u1e63e Zainab Olu\u0301wafu\u0301nmil\u1ecd\u0301la\u0301 (Igbeyin Owuro) and Abdulkareem Jeleel \u1ecclasunkanmi (Ewi\u0300 Ko\u0300b\u1ecdm\u1ecdj\u1eb9\u0301). The overall winner received a cash prize of 100,000 Naira while the rest of the winners received a plaque and 50,000 naira each.\n\n\u201cToday, we are happy to announce the launch of the 3rd edition. And we\u2019re calling on previously unpublished writers working in the Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 language to put in their works. We\u2019ll be accepting submissions from the 1st of June to the 30th of October. The judging process will commence from November 1 to January 30 while the award ceremony will happen in Ibadan on February 21, 2023, in commemoration of International Mother Language Day.\n\n\u201cWith the support of our stakeholders, we are also happy to announce that the prize has increased and the overall winner will be going home with 250,000 naira and his book will be published in hard copies, while three other winners will go home with 100,000 Naira each, \u201d it stated.\n\nLooking forward, the group said, \u201cFor the next five years, in addition to making our existing works sustainable, we are also looking at building a state-of-the-art Cultural Innovation hub dedicated to advancing the course of African cultures while leveraging innovation and technology. The Cultural Innovation Hub will be a place for young people to collaborate physically and virtually to develop the next startup, idea, project, and initiative that promotes African cultures and languages.\n\n\u201cAt ATELEWO, we believe that the future of the world is both Tech and Youth, and if we want to preserve and promote African culture and languages, we need to create the right environment for young people to develop assets so they can take up the agency for the responsibilities around building for culture.\u201d\n\nThe statement concluded by appreciating lovers of the Yoruba language and culture, adding that \u201cmuch of what we have done would not have been possible without their support.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we will like to appreciate Professor Adeleke Adeeko, Humanities Distinguished Professor & Department Interim Chair at the Ohio State University. Professor Ade\u0301\u1eb9\u0300k\u1ecd\u0301 is our patron and he has done a lot to provide us with guidance, network, and support for our various activities in the last three years. We will also like to appreciate Mr. \u1eccla\u0301de\u0301le\u0301 Oni\u0301le\u0301-Ere for his support for the organisation, most especially in the development and sustenance of our annual prize for Yoru\u0300ba\u0301 literature.\n\n\u201cOthers we will like to appreciate are Professor A\u0300ri\u0300npe\u0301 Ade\u0301ju\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300, Dr. Tosin Gbogi, Dr. James Yeku, Dr. Gabriel Bamgbose, Jumoke Verissimo, Molara Wood, Kola Tubosun, Akin Adesokan, Damil\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 Ad\u00e9b\u1ecd\u0301n\u1ecd\u0300j\u1ecd, Professor Moy\u1ecd\u0300 O\u0300ke\u0301di\u0300ji\u0301, Fatoba Onala, Gbenga Adeoba, Ayo Adams, Deji Akomolafe, Professor Saheed Aderinto, Odolaye Aremu, Musiliu Dasofunjo and many others too numerous to mention.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we will like to appreciate organisations like Goethe-Institut, The Artivists, Oyo Insights, Yoruba Name, Distrifoods, Building Nations Initiative, HueNation Agency, Petspoint Recycling, and others,\u201d Atelewo concluded.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Elebeke\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has stated that it will commence the process of enforcement and recovery of unremitted tax deductions owed by some States and Local Governments in Nigeria.\n\nThis decision is contained in a public notice, signed by its Executive Chairman, Muhammad Nami, where the tax authority noted that most States and Local Governments have failed to remit to the Service Withholding Tax (WHT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) deductions from payments made to contractors and service providers by them as required by law.\n\nThe Notice, highlighting relevant portions of the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) and the Value Added Tax Act (VATA), stated that Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government, as well as Parastatals and other establishments were mandated by law to deduct certain taxes while making payments to third parties and remit those deductions to the FIRS.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of Sections 78(3), 79(3), 81 of the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA), and Sections 9(I), 13(1) of the Value Added Tax Act (VATA), mandate Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government (MDAs), Parastatals and other establishments to deduct WHT and VAT while making payments to third parties and remit same to the Service.\n\n\u201cBy the provisions of the relevant laws, States and Local Governments are statutorily mandated, as agents of collection, to deduct at source and remit to the Service, all taxes deducted, within twenty-one days,\u201d the notice read.\n\nIt further stated that most States and Local Governments have failed to comply with these provisions of the law, despite appeals from the FIRS.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is regrettable to note that most of the States and Local Governments have failed in their responsibilities of remitting WHT and VAT deducted from payments made to contractors and service providers as required by law.\n\n\u201cThe implication is the huge tax debts owed by the States and Local Governments.\n\n\u201cAll entreaties by the Service to ensure the remittance of the established unremitted tax deductions by the defaulting States and Local Governments have been unsuccessful as a result of lack of cooperation in adopting the e-payment platforms provided by the FIRS for a seamless deduction and remittance of these taxes.\u201d\n\nFollowing failure to remit by defaulting States and Local Governments, the FIRS has stated that it will consequently advise the Federal Government and the Honourable Minister of Finance, to henceforth decline approval of any request for the issuance of state bonds or other securities in the capital market; as well as requests for external borrowing and approval for domestic loans from commercial banks or other financial institutions by any of the State and Local Governments with outstanding unremitted tax deductions.\n\nThe tax authority stated that it would also publicly name and shame the defaulting States and Local Governments while publishing the amounts owed in unremitted tax deductions\n\nIt further stated that it would also invoke the provisions of Section 24 of its Establishment Act which empowers the Accountant General of the Federation to deduct at source, from the monthly FAAC allocations, un-remitted taxes due from any government agency and to thereafter transfer such deductions to the Federation Account and notify the Service.\n\nThe FIRS called on all defaulting States and Local Governments to promptly remit all unremitted tax deductions within 30 days of the publication of the Notice to avoid it taking these enforcement actions.",

          "text": "tasks Buhari on immediate release of Kaduna train attack victims\n\nsays Senate Bill criminalizing payment of ransom diversionary\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nThe member representing Ede North/Ede South/Egbedore/Ejigbo federal constituency of Osun in the House of Representatives, Hon. Bamidele Salem has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently evolve measures to secure the kidnapped victims of recent Kaduna train attack who were still in captivity.\n\nBamidele who staged a lone barefooted walk from the popular unity fountain to the national assembly in Abuja on Wednesday said that it was worrisome that the Nigeria was becoming a jungle where criminals were having a free rein without resistance from the authorities.\n\nBriefing Journalists, Salem said that the number of kidnapped victims had become alarmed.\n\nHe therefore called on Buhari to intensive his efforts to surmount the challenge.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs an individual I am worried by the turn of events in our dear nation. Our nation is becoming a jungle of sorts where criminals carve out turfs and operate freely without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cOne of the key dimensions of this criminality is the unholy practice of kidnapping for ransom, which according reports has spawned a billion naira industry in the last seven years or so.\n\nIt is to our embarrassment as a nation that our wives, mothers, fathers, husbands get routinely kidnapped at will by bandits with many of them losing their lives even after the payment of ransom by their families or communities.\n\n\u201cStatistics of kidnapping in the country chill the bones. A report by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) shows that from 2018 there has been a steady increase in the number of kidnap victims. The figure rose from 987 victims in 2018 to 1,395 in 2019. In 2021 the figure rose to 2,865 in 2020 and 5,287 in 2021. Of the 2021 figure, more than 2000 were children and young people according to a UN study.\n\n\u201cThis year alone, several hundred Nigerians have been kidnapped the most harrowing being the attack on a train along the Abuja-Kaduna rail line in Kaduna State on March 28, this year where 168 people were reported kidnapped and eight persons killed including a young doctor due to travel out of the country the very week of the incident. The kidnapped victims of that attack remain in captivity till this moment. It is not clear how long they will be in captivity.\n\n\u201cWe clearly cannot continue along this route. The kidnappings and deaths resulting therefrom are a stain on our national conscience. The Kaduna train kidnap incident itself is a blight not only the efficiency of our security system but a slap on the face of government whose responsibility it is to secure life and property. That such an attack could happen in broad daylight without our security operatives being capable of fending off the bandits, speaks to a defect in our security system.\n\n\u201cThis defect reflects badly on government. No government can aspire to legitimacy and relevance if it fails the basic test of ensuring the safety and well-being of the people who elected it into office.\n\n\u201cWe are at that point today when the Federal under the leader of President Muhammadu Buhari must rise to it full height and exercise leadership. It is trite to remark that the unfettered activities of bandits, terrorists and other criminals has created the impression in the minds of many Nigerians and even foreigners that the Nigerian state is tottering on the brink of collapse. This impression is re-enforced by the ease with which these criminal elements even take on security operatives. We recall that in August 2021, bandits attacked Nigeria\u2019s elite military institution, the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) killing two officers and abducting another senior officer.\n\n\u201cThat attack and many others elsewhere have belittled our security agencies and have caused Nigerians to lose faith in the ability of their government to protect their inalienable rights to life and property.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari must rekindle that confidence and a good place to start would be to work assiduously to secure the release of the kidnapped Kaduna train victims. Reports and video footages emanating from their abductors are not encouraging. The lives of the hostages hang in the balance as the Federal Government seemingly at its wits end, prevaricates on such sensitive matter of national importance.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be done to secure the release of the Kaduna train victims must be done now and today. Too many precious Nigerian lives have been wasted. If the situation continues the way it is, the average Nigeria citizens especially our youthful population who are looking up to us for solutions to the problems of this national will continually lose hope in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is to void this that I have decided to join my voice to that of other well-meaning citizens of this great country to appeal to the President of this country to say please, in the name of the Almighty Allah, in the name of the God who created the heavens and the earth to rise and redouble his efforts to secure the release of these kidnapped citizens and other fellow citizens of this country who are in the bushes, in the forests and other unimaginable places at this hour whose hope is that they will have a country that will rise up for them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I decided this morning to stage a walk from the unity fountain to this place holding this placard, asking that the President should please, for the sake of Nigerians, posterity arise and do more to free the Kaduna kidnapped victims and other citizens who are in captivity in various parts of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nBamidele recalled that the House of Representatives had in the last 3 years passed over 60 motions on security including amending other relevant laws to further empower the President and the security agencies to rise up to the occasion, saying there was hardly anything else the parliament could do.\n\nHe whoever ruled out the impeachment of the President over the issue, saying that the parliament needed not to create more problem for the country in attempting to solve one.\n\n\u201cI want us to remember that this same institution, the national assembly has moved and passed and over 60 motions on insecurity in various parts of the country in the last 3 years. I don\u2019t speak for the House of Representatives but I can say as a member that this institution couldn\u2019t have done anything than what it has done in the last 3 years including organizing a special security summit. No parliament does that anywhere in the world. It is not the duty of parliament. The parliament is to make laws and to hold the executive accountable to the implementation of those laws but this parliament had gone beyond even its constitutional mandate to invite security chiefs to organize security summit, to pass motions and to amend relevant laws that can cement the security architecture. The onus lies on the desk of the man who was elected as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the federal republic of Nigeria. We don\u2019t have the power to control the police or direct the security services, we even have limited access to information on intelligence. The bulk stops on the desk of Mr. President and that\u2019s why I decided to today to add my voice to those of other citizens of this country, asking him to please do the needful. He should go extra mile to secure the freedom of theses fellow citizens and history will not forget him.\n\n\u201cAs a lawmaker and Nigerian elected to solve problems, I believe very strongly that it has not come to the stage of considering an impeachment of the president. Personally, that\u2019s my opinion. I have been this country for the past 53 years of my life and I have a fair understanding of the political dynamics of the country and I don\u2019t think we should create new problems to attempt to solve other problems. That\u2019s my personal opinion. Like I said I don\u2019t speak for the House and I don\u2019t know if anybody is bringing any motion to that effect but that\u2019s my own personal opinion\u201d, he said.\n\nReminded that the Senate recently passed a bill criminalizing the payment of ransom to kidnappers, Salem who is also a lawyer picked holes with the piece of legislation, describing it as a misplaced attention, diversionary and escapist.\n\n\u201cThe second issue is the bill passed by our sister Chamber criminalizing the payment of ransom. With due respect to that institution, I think it is a misplaced attention because if a citizen has a misfortune of having his son, daughter or wife or anyone kidnapped, he will do all that\u2019s within his own capacity to get them freed and if government appears helpless, non-chalant, inefficient and ineffective, you cannot place the burden of the responsibility of ensuring that that thing is done on the citizens. With due respect to whoever brought that bill and to that institution, I think, that piece of institution is needless, diversionary, escapist. No one whose child is in captivity will have the means to secure the freedom and will not do it especially when you know that the government does not appear to have the capacity to secure their freedom\u201d, he said.\n\nSaluting the courage of some security agents, the lawmaker however called on the government to fish out and expose saboteurs amongst them.",

          "title": "Army to invite Methodist prelate for linking soldiers to kidnapping",
          "text": "Methodist Prelate Samuel Kanu-Uche will be questioned for linking soldiers to kidnapping, the Army said yesterday.\n\nHis Eminence Kanu-Uche, his chaplain and a bishop were kidnapped at the weekend and released 24 hours later after paying N100 million ransom.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday after his release, the Prelate said: \u201dMilitary personnel are aiding the kidnappers who disguise as herders in the daytime but are kidnappers at night.\u201d\n\nThe army took exception to that comment.\n\nThe Director of Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu said the Army would meet with the Prelate to know more about the circumstances surrounding his abduction.\n\nNwachukwu said: \u201dThe insinuation that troops are complicit in the kidnap incident is not entirely premised on any findings of investigations and, therefore, cannot be swallowed hook line and sinker.\n\n\u201cThis allegation, therefore, raises some pertinent questions which are still unanswered.\n\n\u201cGiven our professional disposition and zero tolerance for any misconduct in the Nigerian Army, we will take this weighty allegation seriously and approach the Prelate and the Methodist Church to unravel the basis for the allegation.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu explained that given the spate of insecurity in the Southeast, the question to ask is: \u201cWas the issue reported to the unit covering the area? Did the Methodist Church take the NA into confidence while negotiating the ransom with the kidnappers?\u201d\n\nThe Army spokesman insisted that \u201cno formal complaint has been received by the unit\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cMore worrisome is the fact that it was alleged that the ransom was paid in less than 24 hours. Was the ransom paid to troops? These are questions that beg for answers.\n\n\u201cMoreso, the NA unit has not received any debrief from the Prelate of the Methodist Church.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, important to state that troops are deployed at Forward Operating Base (FOB), Okigwe and in front of the Abia State University, Uturu and no information was made available to them or to 14 Brigade or any other formation, except the information making the rounds in the social media.\n\n\u201cIt must be clarified that troops\u2019 deployment in the Nigerian Army is not done with considerations for ethnic affiliation.\u201d\n\nNarrating his ordeal, the Prelate said: \u201cThey abducted me, the Bishop of Owerri and my Chaplain and took us to the bush and were torturing us. It was in the process of that torture that I hit my right eye on a tree. Even when blood was flowing and I was soaking my eyes with a handkerchief, they didn\u2019t feel like anything happened.\n\n\u201cAll they said was that we should follow them. That they were not actually against Nigerian citizens but against the government, that the government is a bad government.\n\n\u201cThey said the day they will see the President or any of his representatives, they will chew him raw.\n\n\u201cI said I am a churchman, I am not a government official. They said okay, \u2018that is what has saved you. We would have killed you outrightly without asking for any ransom but now that you are a churchman, let\u2019s go inside the bush.\u2019\n\n\u201cI trekked up to 15 kilometres but I knew that we were rig rolling, going up, going down and eventually at 11 pm of that day, they said \u2018okay now, we can negotiate.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey said each of us will pay N50 million and that we are going to pay N150 million. I thought it was a joke. I said we were going to pay N10 million and they said what? \u2018Don\u2019t say that.\u2019 They lifted up their knife to cut me, I said please hold on.\n\nHis words: \u201cI said we will pay the N100 million. After some time, they said where is the money and I said this is Sunday night, how can we get money this night and you know that there is sit -at- home in Igboland. We can\u2019t afford the money now. Be patient till morning, we will make contacts.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that he got scared when the kidnappers lost patience and ordered him to lie down.\n\nThe Prelate added: \u201dOne of them raised a knife to cut me while another pointed a gun at me to show that they were serious.\n\n\u201cI told them we would raise the money. But the irony of it, where they were situated, Nigerian soldiers were there at Lomara junction and these boys were going behind them. The abductors were parading us around the bush until we settled at a place.\n\n\u201dThe leader(of the gang) asked for five Ghana-must-go bags and that N20 million should be put in each bag. While some left to pick the ransom, four others waited and monitored us with guns.\n\n\u201cAround 5:30 pm, the youngest boy who I think is a younger brother to their commander said \u2018Oga congratulations, you are free, you can go now. We have got our money, you can go. Let me show you the road.\n\n\u201cThey took us to the old road. They told us that after buying enough weapons, they are going to bring all those people that were driven away from Zamfara, Katsina, and Sambisa Forest, that they are all coming to locate themselves in Igbo land and deal with us.\n\n\u201cHe said do you know Ibadan Expressway? We are in all the bushes there, we are also in the Southsouth. We are waiting for the slightest signal, we will finish you people and take over this land.\n\nHe called on the government to take a decisive action \u201cotherwise, what is happening in the North will be a child\u2019s play\u201d",

          "title": "Why consensus presidential candidate is not in APC\u2019s interest, by NWC member, others",
          "text": "Why consensus presidential candidate is not in APC\u2019s interest, by NWC member, others\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders including a member of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) yesterday cautioned against foisting a presidential candidate on the party.\n\nThe NWC member Salihu Lukman, who drew attention of the leadership to the danger of a consensus candidate, warned that the temptation for leaders to choose their successors is democratically risky and very costly.\n\nLukman, who is the National Vice Chairman (Northwest), raised the flag in an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari, who submitted himself to internal democratic process in 2013 and 2014, should encourage his successor to follow the same process.\n\n\u201cIf in 2013 and 2014, Buhari could submit himself to internal democratic process, it was therefore important that his successor also followed the same process\u201d, Lukman noted.\n\nThe letter was titled: \u201cSuccession and 2023 APC presidential candidate: Open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari\u201d.\n\nLukman\u2019s letter was his reaction to the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s meeting the President held with APC governors where he asked the states helmsmen to support him to pick his successor.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cDuring the consultative meeting with Progressive Governors on Tuesday, the President had spoken of the internal policies of the APC which allowed first term governors who have served credibly well to stand for re-election.\n\n\u201cAnd second term governors accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions.\n\n\u201cThe president, therefore, solicited for reciprocity and support of governors and other stakeholders in picking his successor who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the president in 2023.\u201d\n\nNoted such request should not be a problem as both party members and leaders would always trust the President\u2019s judgment, Lukman said the big worry was however, whether loyal party leaders and members should just reduce themselves to ordinary observers when sensitive issues were being discussed.\n\nThis, he said, was especially if such issues had very high potential to diminish and damage the President\u2019s revered statue.\n\nLukman said it was important therefore to caution the APC to keep faith with basic tenets of democracy as its major campaign message to Nigerians for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe letter further reads: \u201cThis was eloquently highlighted in Your Excellency\u2019s message to our Progressive Governors when you stated that the key to electoral successes is the ability to hold consultations and for members to put the nation above other interests.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of again being projected to be against some party leaders, I want to appeal to all party leaders to unite in showing restraint at this point of transition.\n\n\u201cI want to strongly appeal to Your Excellency to kindly continue to make every sacrifice necessary to provide measured leadership to our party and our nation.\n\n\u201cYour revered status was earned not by following so-called conventions, which have narrowed our democracy.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Buhari had always summoned the courage to initiate leadership responses that were selfless based on commitment to principles of justice and equity.\n\nLukman prayed that Allah would guide Buhari into taking the right decisions that would broaden the democratic scope in the APC and endear it to Nigerians to facilitate its electoral victory in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cLike in the case of December 10, 2014 APC National Convention, everything will be done at the June 6, 2022 convention to guarantee level playing field for all aspiring presidential candidates of our party.\n\n\u201cAny recommendation to the contrary will be inimical and injurious to the electoral fortunes of our great party, APC.\n\n\u201cThe temptation for leaders to choose their successors is democratically risky and very costly.\u201d\n\nHe explained that a major disadvantage with succession arrangement whereby governors chose their successors was that it negatively affected relationship between the successor and the predecessor.\n\nThis, he said, undermined capacity to influence actions or inactions of successors by their predecessors.\n\nLukman, therefore, advised Buhari on the need to be conscious of his legacies and avoid falling into the temptation of unilaterally picking his successor.\n\nHe urged Buhari not to copy what he described as anti-democratic credentials of a former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who foisted his successor, late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, on his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nPitching tent with Lukman, members of the APC National Stakeholders, cautioned against imposition of candidates in the party.\n\nConvener of the group, Aliyu Audu, called on the President and leaders of the party to allow a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants.\n\nThe group warned that anything short of a free and fair presidential primary could spell doom for the party.\n\nAudu told reporters at a news conference: \u201cWhile we recognise the inalienable rights of the President to be interested in whoever succeeds him and the natural desire to reciprocate the gesture of support he received in his 2014 bid to be the party flag bearer for the 2015 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe APC National Stakeholders believes that the choice of the president should not amount to imposition or foreclose the chance of a free and fair contest where the candidate who reflects all the values and virtues of the party and has the potential to defeat the candidates of other political parties will be democratically elected.\u201d",

          "text": "From Wilfred Eya and Romanus Ugwu\n\nA few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), indications have emerged that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s bid to determine his successor has split the ranks of the ruling party and rattled the camps of various aspirants.\n\nThis comes as a meeting of the APC governors held in Abuja, yesterday, to deliberate on who to support as the party\u2019s presidential aspirant ended without any resolution.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe president had on Tuesday at a meeting with APC\u2019s 22 governors and National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, appealed that he be accorded the privilege of picking his successor.\n\nIn what appeared like a task to the governors, the president told them before traveling to Spain that he would expect reciprocity from his support to them in their choice of successors in their respective states. He urged them to work together to look for a successor that would carry on his vision for the country.\n\nHowever when the governors met, yesterday, opinions were divided over the essence of their meeting as some of the governors expressed lack of hope in whatever choice they come up with. Those who argued this way said it looked like the president had his mind set on his choice and it would be waste of time coming up with any candidate for him.\n\nBreaking!!!

Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\nOne of the governors was said to have said any choices presented to the president would amount you mere formality. It was gathered that after much deliberation, the governors said they would better pick two choices and submit their names to the president.\n\nIt was learnt that the governors agreed that they would suggest one person from the South and another from the North out of which the President would be asked to make his choice.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHowever, multiple sources told Daily Sun that the president\u2019s stance has thrown the camps of most of presidential aspirants into confusion and also split the party.\n\nIt was also learnt that those opposed to the president have expressed the fear that what guarantees victory for political parties is not just who the candidates are, but the process through which they emerge. And that if the process is flawed so much as to leave members disenchanted, the APC was already on its way to losing the election.\n\nOne of our sources said: \u201cThe camps of many aspirants have become jittery and currently in disarray over the president comments. From the body language of the president and his recent comment, the primaries would be a mere formality. He was clear that having produced their successors or having won their second terms for those who were only completing their first term that it was only fair for them also to allow him produce his successor. Many of the aspirants especially the frontline ones are already having sleepless nights especially when they recall what happened during the APC national chairmanship primaries.\u201d\n\nThis comes as a group, APC National Stakeholders criticised the president\u2019s plan and warned it would amount to imposition and foreclosure of chances for a free and fair contest at the primary.\n\nIts convener, Aliyu Audu, at a press conference in Abuja, said while they recognise the inalienable rights of the President to be interested in whoever succeeds him, it was important that his desire does not negate the need to democratically elect a candidate who reflects all the values and virtues of the party and has the potential to defeat the candidates of other political parties in the 2023 poll.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cWe say this because the memories of what transpired at the last national convention of the party where the president picked his choice for the position of the national chairman and literally forced the other aspirants to step down in a manner that can best be described as an imposition is still very fresh\u2026.If he is influenced by what is obtainable at the states where governors brazenly handpick aspirants at different elections, then it is imperative to remind the president that he is supposed to be the moral compass for us as members of the party and Nigerians as a whole. As the president and leader of the party, it is a moral responsibility that he set examples for the governors and future elected leaders to emulate and not the other way round.\n\n\u201cThe best legacy president Buhari can leave for the APC and Nigeria as a whole is the legacy of a deeply entrenched democratic process where Nigerians can freely choose who represents them at whatever level in free, fair, credible and transparent processes.\n\n\u201cThis legacy must manifest from the APC which prides itself as a party with progressives ideals different from the other stocks. If the so-called \u2018established internal policies\u2019 of succession in the party fulfils all democratic criteria, we would not be having as much crisis in the party as we have witnessed in recent times.\u201d\n\nAlso, a member of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC), Salihu Moh Lukman, while rejecting Buhari\u2019s appeal to the governors, described it as undemocratic.\n\nIn an open letter to the president titled: \u2018Succession and 2023 APC presidential candidate\u2019, Lukman enumerated the dangers and implications of taking such unilateral decision on the party.\n\nHe reminded Buhari on the need to replicate the process that ensured his emergence in 2015 in the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer for the 2023 poll.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cAs a party, APC must be able to demonstrate much more sensitivity to the challenges of national unity by ensuring that the eventual standard bearer for the 2023 presidential election embodies commitment to equity and justice as the underlying principles sustaining the corporate existence of Nigeria as a united country.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about representation in terms of where the candidate comes from, but mainly about the negotiation framework leading to the eventual selection of the candidate. In the case of the PDP, negotiation was limited to monetary transactions with the less than 1,000 delegates who eventually elected Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential candidate of the PDP. With all the limitation imposed by the current Electoral Act, the delegates at the APC Convention who will be electing our Presidential candidate will not be less than 4,000. For a party with more than 40 million members, this is a far cry and will be weak in terms of being democratically accountable in terms of decisions of delegates reflecting expectations party members. Once the choice of delegates correlates with expectations of over 40 million party members, invariably, it will most likely equate with the expectations of majority of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and one of the presidential aspirants, asked the APC delegates to put monetary incentives aside and elect a standard bearer who does not have baggage.\n\nIn a letter addressed to APC delegates, yesterday, he said they should put the country first in their choice.\n\nThe senate president said the delegates should vote for him so he could become the presidential candidate of the ruling party and deliver good governance if elected.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Despite the fact that Lawan was the last aspirant to pick nomination form, Kalu was able to energize his campaign and bring him to the front row and that is very commendable.\n\n\u201cLawan\u2019s family should know they have a family in Kalu. It is not easy for a man of his status to drop his presidential ambition for another . His action has taught Nigerians a lot . I have personal love for Kalu because he has swag . He stands on his conviction. The Igbo People will get what they are looking for easily if the Igbo people follow him. He has proven to be there for the Senate President at a time he needed him most. He should be commended by every well meaning Nigerian for standing firm on the principles of equity,justice and fairness; for pushing for the support of the North East after the South East couldn\u2019t clinch it. The entire North and North East in particularly will never forget the high wired support gotten from the South East through Kalu.\u201d\n\nBreaking!!!

Kalu, who has been advocating for a South-easterner to become the next president, had in January announced he would contest the 2023 election if the ticket of the APC was zoned to the South East\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHowever, in a statement, the Senator said he decided to withdraw from the race since there is \u201cno zoning\u201d in the APC and the contest has been thrown open to all aspirants.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe APC is, however, yet to officially announce if the presidential ticket would be zoned.\n\nKalu added that he would contest the Abia North Senatorial election.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained an unambiguous stand that for justice, equity and fairness in our country, the next president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari should come from the South East or the North East. I have also told Nigerians that I would only run for president if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the South East. That is why I was disappointed with our southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but have zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South .\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South Easterner being president of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North Easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about. It further means that the justice is on its way to the South East. I thank those who said they have picked presidential form for me because they meant well for Nigerians. However, since there is no zoning and the contest is open to all Nigerians, I officially withdraw from presidential contest in 2023. I have also picked ticket to run for Abia North Senatorial zone and to complete the good work I started in Abia North.\u201d\n\nKalu later congratulated Lawan for picking the nomination form of the APC, and urged all his allies to support the presidential bid of Lawan.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Judge orders substituted service\n\n\n\nSunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered that the Labour Party and some of its officials be served with a fresh suit pertaining to its leadership crisis through a substituted means.\n\nThe judge, Inyang Ekwo, made the order on Monday after hearing an ex parte application filed by a former Deputy national chairman of the party, Calistus Okafor.\n\nIn the court order seen by our reporter on Wednesday, the judge ordered that the defendants be served through the pasting of the court documents filed by the plaintiff at the Labour Party\u2019s secretariat in Abuja within seven days.\n\nOkafor, a factional leader of the party, is by his suit, challenging the legality of the leadership of Akingbade Oyelakin, whom he said \u201crepresents persons wrongfully and unlawfully parading themselves as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of Labour Party\u201d.\n\nHe also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as a co-defendant.\n\nOthers sued by Okafor include Julius Abure and Umar Farouq who emerged as the national chairman and the secretary of the party, respectively, at a national executive committee meeting of the party held in Benin, Edo State, in March 2021.\n\nThe rest of the defendants sued by the defendants are members of the committee set up by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to take over the affairs of the party.\n\nThe committee members are Salisu Mohammed, Lawson Osagie, Isa Aremu, Baba Aye, Ikpe Ektokudo, Sylvester Ejiofor, and Lucy Offiong. Sued along with them are one Salamatu Aliyu and the NLC.\n\nThe court in its order issued on Monday ordered a \u201csubstituted service of the originating summons, interlocutory injunction, and all other processes in this suit on the 1st to 3rd, 6th to 12th and 14th defendants by pasting the said processes at their political party\u2019s office, which is the 5th defendant\u2019s office, located at No 2, Oke Agbe Street, Off Ladoke Akintoal Boulevard, Garki 11, Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe 1st to 3rd defendants are Abure, Farouq and Oyelakin. The 6th to the 12th defendants are the members of the NLC committee and the 14th defendant is Aliyu.\n\nThe court ordered that the service must be effected \u201cwithin seven days of this order.\u201d\n\nThe judge then adjourned the case until June 30 \u201cfor further mention\u201d.\n\nTHISDAY had reported how Okafor threatened to file the suit and how the legal action might threaten the presidential ambition of a former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) last week and emerged as the presidential candidate of the LP faction led by Abure.\n\nHowever, Okafor told THISDAY that Obi decided to defect to LP without proper information on the fact that the party\u2019s leadership had been a subject of litigation since 2018.\n\nOkafor claimed that he remained the authentic national chairman of the party. He explained that he got the post by virtue of his position as Deputy National Chairman of the party when the late national chairman, Abdulsalam, was in office. He added that Abure, who is currently leading a faction of the party, was Acting National Secretary, when Abdulsalam, died in 2020.\n\nOkafor further claimed that Abure announced himself as National Chairman without recourse to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, following Abdulsalam\u2019s demise. He said the LP constitution stipulated that the deputy national chairman should act and/or replace the chairman in the event of death or resignation.\n\nOkafor explained, \u201cThe decision of Abure to make himself chairman, with the active collaboration of some members, actually led to the current leadership crisis in the LP.\n\n\u201cI, Calistus Okafor, approached the court to get a pronouncement to force Abure out and the case has been pending.\n\n\u201cThe matter will come up tomorrow (today) at the Federal High Court. There is no way we would allow an Acting National Secretary to forcefully take over the party and replace the late national chairman against the provisions of the constitution of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NLC and the TUC actually registered the Labour Party in 2006, but they were not the ones administering it.\n\n\u201cPeter Obi, at the moment, has been deceived and he is sitting on a keg of gunpowder and it is a pity. He went to wolves in sheep clothing thinking he was discussing with the right people. Staying in the PDP would have been better for him.\n\n\u201cThe LP has not done any convention since 2014, after the last one it did in Akure, the Ondo State capital.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Urges them to vote for leader with \u201cno-baggage\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has canvassed for votes from delegates to the presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) scheduled for next week in Abuja.In a letter personally signed by him, Lawan, an APC presidential aspirant, with humility, asked for the delegates\u2019 votes so that he could emerge as the APC Presidential flag bearer for the 2023 Nigerian Presidential election.\n\nHe also urged them to choose a person that would lead and not rule Nigerians and \u201ca leader with absolutely no-baggage.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\n\u201cMy Dear APC Party Delegates,\n\n\u201cCompliments of the season. Permit me to write to you through this medium. As we converge at this great time, in this great party to begin the journey of determining the future of this great nation, we must be cognizant of the fact that the fate of Nigeria fluctuates.\n\nWhile democracy asserts that the Nigerian voting public determines the person to emerge as President, however in advance of that, the party delegates are saddled with the task of nominating the flag bearers. This communication is an appeal to all APC delegates as the party prepares for its presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cI am reaching out to every single one of you APC delegates to plead with you to put \u2018Nigeria First\u2019 and give thought to the future of 215,763,437 (million) Nigerians, a lot of whom will appreciate the sagacious determination you will make during this process. I am reaching out to you, with humility, to ask for your votes so that I can emerge as the APC Presidential flag bearer for the 2023 Nigerian Presidential election.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it is not lost on me that we must come together as one party and as one nation, for we have a great deal to mend, to rehabilitate, to reinstall and so much more to achieve. We have a unique chance to measure up to every expectation and show Nigeria and the world that Democracy triumphs. And that journey shall start during the APC Presidential Primary Election process. \u201cTo all delegates across Nigeria, I beseech you to put pecuniary and monetary incentives aside and seriously consider what is \u2018in the greater good.\u2019 As you make your decision in picking the flag bearer of our party, I urge you to seek for a leader and not a politician. I ask you to choose a person that will lead and not rule Nigerians; one that will be understanding, tolerant, fair, honest, and progressive. A leader that comes with absolutely \u2018No-Baggage.\u2019 A vital component of any logical, efficient and authentic evaluation of a person involves assessing past behavior. The key here is that one\u2019s best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If one has always done something a certain way, they are likely to do that same thing in the same manner in the future. The same goes for how one navigates or pillages in leadership. Thus, as you, the delegates, are determining the APC party presidential flag bearer, it is important to look at past behavior to elicit what behaviors, avarice and rapacity candidates have exhibited in the past. It is important for you to access all candidates along this parameter.\n\n\u201cDear delegates, look for a leader that will not buy your votes but one that is prepared to sell and deliver your dreams. I promise you that I will be that leader. I am prepared to offer you myself and my heart; my integrity, my dedication and my might. I want to offer you a dream of justice for all, a dream of uniting to fight the foes we face, a dream of unity under one single ideal, common purpose, common endeavor and resolve; a dream to right the wrongs of our past, a dream of work, employment, functioning safe schools, security, electricity, infrastructure, stable economy, compassion for citizenry, technology, opportunity and so much more that Nigerians desire.\n\n\u201cI will give you my all, thinking not of power, but of possibility and the public good. I want you to take my hand so that together, we can show the Nigerian story of hope, unity, tolerance, healing, principle, greatness and goodness. I want you to take my hand so that together we can learn from history, embrace faith and find a way to unify Nigeria and take her into the future. We are at an extraordinary historic moment both in APC and in Nigeria and our unity is the path forward.\n\n\u201cDear delegates, I give you my word, I will defend the constitution. I\u2019ll defend our democracy. I will defend Nigeria. I will defend every single Nigerian from every nook and cranny, across the length and breath of the nation and from every corner. I commit to defend all 371 spectacular tribes existing in this brilliant, colorful, diverse and beautiful nation.\n\n\u201cThis and nothing more than this is what we owe to our forefathers, this is what we owe to each other and this is what we owe to the generations that will follow behind us; to our children and our children\u2019s children.\n\nDear APC delegates, you have the sacred mission at this hour of history, during this hour of decision of taking this country to a plain beyond. I urge you to assist me in uniting Nigeria in our common desire to move forward together.\n\n\u201cWe shall meet on the voting field as members of Africa\u2019s largest party and as Nigerians united in our resolve to remain the most vibrant party in Africa and one of the greatest nations on earth. We shall meet on the voting field to tell the positive tale of Nigeria. While this is expected of every Nigerian, it starts with you, the APC delegates.\n\n\u201cI give you my word that I shall not fail you. To this end, I ask for your precious votes and your dedication to our party, APC, and to our motherland. I give you my word that, given the privilege of carrying the APC Presidential ticket, I will represent you with pride, courage, equity, endurance, faith, conviction, devotin to you all and the country we love with all our hearts. I give you my word that I will strive to take the APC presidential ticket nomination you will hopefully give to me and turn it into a landslide win in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAl-Haji Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Al-Haji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Herbert Macaulay, Professor Eyo Ita, Alvan Ikoku, Chief Anthony Enahoro, Sir Egbert Udo Udoma, Al-Haji Aminu Kano, Chief S.

          "text": "\u2022Declares Tambuwal\u2019s decision arranged, dishonourable, tragic betrayal\n\n\u2022Says Peter Obi\u2019s position now vindicated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\n\n\nElder statesman and leader of the Ijaw nation, Chief Edwin Clark, has described the National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as a thoughtless and partial leader and therefore, asked him to resign his position as a matter of urgency.\n\nClark, who claimed Ayu could not hide his biases, when he paid the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal a \u201cthank you\u201d visit during which he described him as the \u201chero of the convention\u201d, also contended that the decision by the Sokoto governor to step down for the winner of the presidential primaries, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, was arranged and as such, dishonourable and a tragic betrayal.\n\nTo that extent, Clark, who is the leader of Southern, Middle Belt Leaders Forum and Pan Niger Delta Forum, said the decision by a former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi to quit the PDP and withdraw from the presidential primaries was well-thought out and vindicated the presidential hopeful.\n\nClark, in a statement he personally signed yesterday, in Abuja, said with the outcome of PDP\u2019s primary election, it had become imperative for Ayu to resign, saying he could no longer head the National Working Committee of the PDP.\n\nTaking a swipe at the action of Tambuwal, Clark insisted that, what Tambuwal did was not only dishonorable, but also a serious electoral abnormality and a tragic betrayal of national patriotism for hidebound interests.\n\nThe former Federal Information Minister condemned the reported outrageous financial inducements of delegates and the alleged dollarisation of the electoral process, saying it was an indication of more likely, deleterious outcomes of the 2023 general election, mainly the presidential and their aftermaths.\n\nClark, however, hailed efforts of the Convention Committee that was chaired by former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, and his assistants, particularly, the Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri.\n\n\u201cMost disturbing is what happened at the Special National Convention of the PDP, in Abuja, on Saturday, 28th May 2022. I followed the live broadcasts of the proceedings, keenly, until about 12.30 am on Sunday, 29th of May.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by the outrageous and Machiavellian manner in which Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State, was so apparently \u201carranged\u201d to announce his withdrawal from the contest at the last minute; his speech changed the mood of the event.\n\n\u201cThat was done in order to foist another northerner as the party\u2019s flag bearer, having regard to the fact that Governor Aminu Tambuwal was the only aspirant from the whole of the north-west, which had about 192 delegates at the convention.\n\n\u201cWhat Tambuwal did was not only dishonourable but also a serious electoral abnormality and a tragic betrayal of national patriotism for hidebound interests.\n\n\u201cIt is now widespread understanding that there were pressures mounted on Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and former Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki, to also withdraw, while Tambuwal deliberately delayed his action till the last minute. By so doing, unduly swept his north west votes to Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cOne can now appreciate the reasons given by Mr. Peter Obi for his withdrawal from the PDP, both as a member and as an aspirant, few days before the party\u2019s primary. And I would think that what he did was, without doubt, in respect, or obedience, to the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some aspirants from the south believed that, with the resources and facilities at their disposal, their Elders no longer matter, and disregarded, with impunity, the patriotic advice on the need to be steadfast on the position of the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cThey never minded that what we have been advocating was in their interest. They proved themselves to be selfish and arrogant, and thought they could win on their own steam. They failed; I can only hope that they have, now, learned their lessons.\n\n\u201cEven much worse, in the extreme, was the action of the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, in his open visit to Governor Tambuwal to congratulate and hail him, in his words, as \u2018the hero of the Convention.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis clearly reveals his partiality and predilection in the processes leading to the baffling conclusion of the PDP Presidential Primary. Senator Ayu has failed to realise that what we are fighting for affects all minorities in Nigeria. Senator Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s appalling, thoughtless and unpatriotic public conduct bears grave negative consequences.\n\n\u201cHe should, therefore, no longer consider himself fit and proper to retain his position as the National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and should resign now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says his candidate will give Nigerians sense of victory, confidence ahead of poll\n\n\u2022Governors meeting deadlocked\n\n\u2022NWC members accuse Adamu of rendering body redundant, taking unilateral decisions\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia and Okon Bassey in Uyo\n\n\n\nWith his words carefully chosen and intention unmistaken, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, pleaded with the 22 governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to allow him choose his successor in reciprocity, ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries next week. Buhari made the appeal at a meeting in Abuja with the governors, which was also attended by other stakeholders.\n\nThe president said the governors should reciprocate the party\u2019s good gesture of allowing outgoing governors choose their successors in their respective states. He assured that his choice presidential candidate would give Nigerians a sense of triumph and confidence ahead of the general election, and promised to sustain ongoing consultations ahead of the primary election.\n\nBut a meeting of the governors immediately after the one with the president was deadlocked as they could not agree amongst themselves, whether the president\u2019s choice should come from the north or the south of the country.\n\nThe governors, who had met to see if they could resolve and agree amongst them, where the candidate should come from and if actually, they could recommend from amongst them, were still at their meeting in their early hours of today, when this report was being filed.\n\nBuhari\u2019s request, however, came as the simmering crisis in APC appeared to take another dimension, with members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) accusing the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant.\n\nIn a related development, Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule cautioned members and supporters of APC against unguarded utterances about the party\u2019s primary elections in the state.\n\nAddressing APC governors, under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), at a closed-door meeting at the State House, Abuja, also attended by Adamu and other stakeholders, the president said his desire to determine his successor was in line with established internal policies of the party, especially, as it approached the convention in a few days.\n\n\u201cI wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Buhari said in the two-page address.\n\nHe said the party had successfully established internal policies that promoted continuity and smooth succession plans, even at the state and local government levels.\n\nThe president, who is also the national leader of the party, emphasised that first-term governors, who had served credibly, had been encouraged to stand for re-election, while \u201csecond term governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\u201d\n\nHe declared that APC\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 polls would be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence ahead of the general election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone, who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\u201d\n\nThe president further appealed to the governors \u201cto allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community.\u201d\n\nHe assured them that consultation would continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders were brought on board right through to the convention, and anxieties were effectively brought under control.\n\nBuhari charged APC governors to ensure that the forthcoming convention to pick a presidential candidate reflected all the values and virtues of the party.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe processes for the 2023 general election have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful political parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cAs I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the party, I recognise the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.\n\n\u201cSuch leadership is required so that the party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the centre, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers, and also gain additional number of states.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the party will be holding its convention during which primaries would take place to pick the presidential flag bearer for the 2023 general election. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the governors, the Kebbi State governor, and Chairman of PGF, Atiku Bagudu, said the party must build on the success of its recent elective convention, and the primaries conducted so far, \u201cand come up with a candidate, who will walk in the footsteps of patriotism and love for the country, which Mr President has shown. We will support Mr President to have a very successful convention.\u201d\n\nAdamu Has Rendered NWC Redundant, Taken Unilateral Decisions, Say Members\n\nMembers of the APC National Working Committee (NWC), yesterday, accused the party\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant and taking unilateral decisions. They warned that henceforth, any unilateral decision taken by Adamu or any other party functionary, which required the approval of the NWC, as enshrined in the APC constitution, would be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\nThe NWC members said no one was elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices at the national secretariat.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAPC and the Need for Vigilance: Urgent Call for Intervention\u201d, and jointly signed by National Vice Chairman, North-west, Dr. Salihu Lukman, and National Vice Chairman, South-west, Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke, the NWC members lamented that within two months in the life of the Adamu-led leadership, critical decisions about the affairs of the party were being taken unilaterally by the chairman.\n\nThey expressed worry that all efforts to get the national chairman to respect the authority of the NWC had proved unsuccessful, adding that they are compelled to issue the statement following postponement of the scheduled NWC meetings twice within 48 hours. The party chieftains noted that they were convinced that the rescheduling was a deliberate attempt to foist a fait accompli on the NWC on fundamental issues that affect the party.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWithin just two months in the lifespan of the new leadership of our great party, APC, led by His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the NWC, organ of the party vested with the power of managing the day-to-day affairs, including implementing decisions of the National Executive Committee (NEC), as provided in Article 13.4 of the APC Constitution, has been rendered redundant.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman takes decisions unilaterally. When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions.\n\n\u201cEvery effort to get the chairman to respect the authority of the NWC, as elected by the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention, is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the national chairman or any individual.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman must be properly reminded to recognise that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC, as provided in provisions of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cHe is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirit of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules. No NWC member is elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices in the national secretariat.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on honest, fair, just, and selfless commitment to party building. God bless our party!\u201d\n\nSule to APC Members: Stop Unguarded Utterances on Primaries\n\nNasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule, yesterday, cautioned APC members and supporters in the state against making unguarded utterances regarding the party\u2019s primary elections in the state. Sule said this against the backdrop of a negative impression being created in the media by party members who had expressed dissatisfaction with certain sections of the delegates list used for the primaries.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra, Sule said, \u201cIt is important to state that the list of delegates used for the governorship primaries was not tampered with at all and the party\u2019s complaint was not in reference to the state\u2019s delegate list.\n\n\u201cThe noticeable changes of concern to the party leadership were only in respect of some wards in seven out of the 13 local government areas of the state. The party leadership at all levels will work together to find an amicable resolution of all issues of concern.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the insinuations and propaganda by some individuals that there was a dispute with the national secretariat of the party was unfortunate and far from the truth.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is worthy of reiterating that the primaries in most of the constituencies in the state were adjudged as transparent and peaceful. As a united APC family, we are confident that these minor internal issues will be resolved in no time.\n\n\u201cParty members should, irrespective of the results of the primaries, endeavour to close ranks and work for the unity and success of the party.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Convention Shouldn\u2019t Be Another Dollar Rain\u2019\n\nA chieftain of the ruling APC, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, warned that the party had a high responsibility not to allow its presidential primaries and convention to become \u201canother dollar rain and a trading platform for the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from his media office in Abuja, yesterday, Olawepo-Hashim explained \u201cthat our country is neither a commodity to be traded, nor a property to be auctioned and sold to the highest bidder,\u201d adding, \u201cNigerian presidency has never been for sale and should not be for sale now.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has demonstrated that it has learnt nothing, but as a party, the APC cannot follow her inglorious example. The next president of Nigeria must not be a Mafioso leader. Our president must not be a gangster. As a party in government, the APC has a sacred and patriotic duty to guide a disciplined transfer of power not one left in the hands of the god of mammon.\u201d\n\nAs the party of the sitting president, Olawepo-Hashim argued that a lot was expected from APC in terms of direction and leadership, adding that the government still has a lot of leverage and political enforcement mechanisms beyond money.\n\nThe former presidential candidate noted, \u201cNational interest is what should guide the choice of the APC and some of the urgent national imperative should include shortlisting a candidate that will heal the wounds of division in the country and finding also a vice that will complement him/her in this national objective.\u201d\n\nDowells: Any Attempt to Zone APC Ticket to North Suicidal\n\nAn APC chieftain in Akwa Ibom State and Coordinator, Movement for Better Nigeria (MBN), Dr Paul Dowells, warned against any attempt by the ruling party to zone its presidential ticket to the north. Dowells, at a press conference in Uyo, yesterday, said such decision would seriously imperil the party\u2019s chances at the polls next year.\n\nSpeaking against the background of speculations that the leadership of APC was considering a northern presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential race, Dowells stressed that giving the ticket to a northerner was not a yardstick for winning elections. Rather, he said, it was the pedigree and charisma of the person carrying the party\u2019s flag that would determine his acceptance.\n\nDowells argued that if APC wanted to win the 2023 elections, the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, should be considered.\n\nHe said, \u201cZoning the presidential ticket to the north because PDP has a northerner as a presidential candidate does not make sense. If APC wants to win the 2023 elections, Professor Yemi Osinbajo should be given the ticket either by consensus or nomination, otherwise, retaining the Aso rock may be an illusion.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Prelate of Methodist Church Nigeria, His Eminence Samuel Uche, has revealed that the Fulani herdsmen who kidnapped him and others tortured him such that he nearly lost his sight after hitting his right eye on a tree.\n\nThe cleric who narrated his near-death experience in the hands of kidnappers said they were eight in number, all Fulani herders, with one who claimed to have been born in Abia State.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the Prelate, his chaplain, Very Rev. Abidemi Shittu, and the Bishop of Owerri, Rt. Rev. Dennis Mark were abducted on Sunday along the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway in the Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State.\n\nUche, who recounted his experience at a press conference held at Methodist Church, Yaba, Lagos State, on Tuesday, alleged that some military personnel from the North were aiding the kidnappers in their activities in the region.\n\nThe Prelate said, \u201cThese people came out from the bush; they divided themselves into 3 places; some people fired at us and there was another group in front to make sure that we didn\u2019t run away; they fired shots at our vehicle and eventually, they abducted 3 of us.\n\n\u201cThe communication man of the church was able to escape, the driver was able to escape; they abducted me, the bishop of Owerri and my chaplain and they took us to the bush and were torturing us. It was in the process of that torture that I hit my right eye on a tree. Even when blood was flowing and I was soaking my eyes with a handkerchief, they didn\u2019t feel like anything happened.\n\n\u201cAll they said was that we should follow them; that they were not actually against Nigerian citizens but against the government, that the government is a bad government.\n\n\u201cThey are Fulani boys; all the 8 are Fulanis; they said the day they will see the president or any of his representatives they will chew him raw; that he is their brother but he has disappointed them and has disappointed Nigeria.\n\n\"I said even though I'm part of the government, I'm a churchman, I'm not a government official; they said okay, that is what has saved you, we would have killed you outright without asking for any ransom but now that you are a churchman, let's go inside the bush.\n\n\u201cI trekked up for to 15 kilometres but I knew that we were rigmaroling, going up, going down and eventually at 11 pm they said okay now we can negotiate; each of us will pay N50 million and we are going to pay N150 million. I thought it was a joke; I said we were going to pay N10 million and they said what? Don\u2019t say that; they lifted their knife to cut me, I said please hold on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cleric, the leader of the group is about 35 years old while the others are about 18.\n\nHe said they had taken his rings, chain, and the money they had on them and insisted on N150 million ransom.\n\nThe clergyman said the abductors later reduced the ransom to N100 million, warning that if they negotiate, they would be killed.\n\n\u201cI said okay. We will pay you N100 million. After some time, they said where is the money and I said this is Sunday night, how can we get money this night and you know that there is this sit-at-home in Igbo land. We can't afford the money now, be patient till morning, we will make contacts.\"\n\nUche said the kidnappers lost patience, laid Bishop Dennis Mark down, raised a knife to cut him, while another pointed a gun at him (prelate) to show that they were serious,\n\n\u201cI told them we will raise the money for you. But the irony of it, where they were situated, the soldiers, all of Fulani extraction, Nigerian soldiers, they were there at Lomara junction and these boys were going behind them. Meanwhile, they kept their cows somewhere, numbering about 200.\n\nHe said some people were taking care of the cows while the abductors were parading them around the bush until they settled at a place,\n\n\u201cThey said 'when are you bringing the money?' I said by 12 noon, I will call the people I\u2019ve contacted whether the money had been raised and I called them, they said that they were gathering the money and they heard it because they said I will use my phone to talk, they can't use their phone, they don\u2019t want to be tracked.\n\n\u201cTheir leader was born in Igbo land but his parents have died. He said he was born around Umuahia Amuzukwu and his father was a cow dealer, the boy understood Igbo,\" he said.\n\nHe said the leader threatened to kill them if they informed security operatives when they had raised the ransom of N100 million.\n\nThe leader asked them to buy 5 'Ghana must go' bags and put N20 million in each bag. They left to pick the ransom while four others stayed behind with guns.\n\nHe said, \u201cAround 5. 30pm, the youngest boy who I think is a younger brother to their commander said 'Oga, congratulations, you are free, you can go now. We have got our money, you can go. Let me show you the road'.\n\n\u201cThey took us to Old road, where they wrote 'welcome to Imo\u2019 and \u2018goodbye from Abia'.\n\n\u201cThey told us that after buying enough weapons, they were going to bring all those people that were driven away from Zamfara, Katsina, Sambisa Forest, that they are all coming to locate themselves in Igbo land and deal with us.\n\n\u201cHe said do you know Ibadan expressway? We are in all the bush there, we are also in the South-South, we are waiting for the slightest signal, we will finish you people and take over this land. They claimed that Nigeria belongs to Fulani.\"\n\nThe priest maintained that military personnel of Fulani extraction were aiding the kidnappers who disguise as herders in the daytime but are kidnappers at night.\n\nHe called on the government to take a decisive action \"otherwise what is happening in the north will be a child\u2019s play\u201d.\n\nHe said it was the Methodist Church Nigeria and members of the church that made efforts to secure his release and not security agencies of the government.",

They left to pick the ransom while four others stayed behind with guns.\n\nHe said, \u201cAround 5. 30pm, the youngest boy who I think is a younger brother to their commander said 'Oga, congratulations, you are free, you can go now. We have got our money, you can go. Let me show you the road'.\n\n\u201cThey took us to Old road, where they wrote 'welcome to Imo\u2019 and \u2018goodbye from Abia'.\n\n\u201cThey told us that after buying enough weapons, they were going to bring all those people that were driven away from Zamfara, Katsina, Sambisa Forest, that they are all coming to locate themselves in Igbo land and deal with us.\n\n\u201cHe said do you know Ibadan expressway? We are in all the bush there, we are also in the South-South, we are waiting for the slightest signal, we will finish you people and take over this land. They claimed that Nigeria belongs to Fulani.\"\n\nThe priest maintained that military personnel of Fulani extraction were aiding the kidnappers who disguise as herders in the daytime but are kidnappers at night.\n\nHe called on the government to take a decisive action \"otherwise what is happening in the north will be a child\u2019s play\u201d.\n\nHe said it was the Methodist Church Nigeria and members of the church that made efforts to secure his release and not security agencies of the government.",

Wike was one of the aspirants who challenged Atiku for the presidential ticket of the party but lost out.\n\nSule Lamido\n\nLamido, however, said despite the contributions of Wike to the party, the choice of Atiku was best for the party and Nigerians in general.\n\nThe former Jigawa governor said this during an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWike has tremendously worked for the party and made huge contributions to the party and in the last two years, nobody talked about the party more than Wike, I agree. But you see, at the end of the day, it is the political will of the people of PDP which will prevail.\n\n\u201cAnd the party picked who they thought is the best for the presidential ticket,\u201d he said.\n\nLamido, while reacting to Wike\u2019s comment that he could have scuttled the presidential primary when Sokoto governor, Aminu Tambuwal was allowed to mount the podium again to announce his decision to step down, said the Rivers governor reacted to the defeat like any other human being.\n\n\n\n\u201cWike is a normal human being with feelings, emotions and expectations. So, when expectations are not met, emotions come in naturally, all of us are there for the party,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nHe insisted that the decision to ensure Atiku triumphed was not made based on the region he comes from, but to give the party the best sellable candidate to challenge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party.\n\nLamido is reportedly one of the northern leaders who convinced Tambuwal to step down and back Atiku\u2019s candidacy during last Saturday\u2019s presidential primaries and national convention of the party.",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Adesuwa Rhodes: \u201cWomen don\u2019t need more seats at the table, we need to create our tables.\u201d",
          "text": "It\u2019s a bit ironic that while women run 40% of Africa\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), they receive only 1% of funding from Venture capital (VC) firms.\n\nCompared to the fact that male single and all-male founding teams received 84% of the funding from VCs in 2021, the handwriting on the wall is clear: female-led startups in Africa remain critically underrepresented and underfunded.\n\nAdesuwa Okunbo Rhodes has a simple solution to this. \u201cWomen don\u2019t need more seats at the table, we need to create our tables,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nThe tables she\u2019s referring to are the investment firms \u2014 both VC and private equity (PE)\u2014that fund businesses. The disparity in female-funded startups is fuelled by the fact that most investment firms are also led or owned by males.\n\nSo Rhodes, who has 13 years of investment banking experience under her belt, created her own table by starting a PE firm in 2019.\n\nBorn in Lagos, Rhodes moved to the UK to continue schooling in her teens and then went on to graduate from the University of Bristol in England.\n\nHer investment career started at Lehman Brothers in June 2008, but that journey was cut short by the 2008 financial crisis that took place four months later, which led to the eventual collapse of the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers.\n\nAfter Lehman Brothers, she started a 4-month internship at JP Morgan. When the internship ended, she went to TLG Capital for a short period, and then went back to JP Morgan for a full-time job where she worked on acquisitions and leveraged finance deals worth about $5.6 billion for almost 4 years.\n\nHer desire to invest in Africa was sparked in 2011 during her 5 months at TLG Capital, a private equity firm that invests across Africa. Rhodes worked at TLG Capital briefly after her initial four months internship with JP Morgan and before being retained for a full-time position.\n\n\u201cAt TLG Capital, we did a number of investments across Anglophone Africa but the most important one I would say is one we did in Uganda,\u201d Rhodes recalls.\n\nThe firm made an investment in a local manufacturer of generic anti-malaria and antiretroviral drugs, which brought attractive returns and empowered the local manufacturer to become self-sufficient enough to export its products to other countries that didn\u2019t have drugs.\n\n\u201cAfter that experience, I thought, \u2018I want to do something like this back in Nigeria but I didn\u2019t know how I was going to go about it,\u2019\u201d Rhodes said.\n\nIn 2014, while at JPMorgan, Rhodes was approached by Syntaxis Capital, a European private equity firm that had about $300 million dollars under management, to help build out their African business.\n\nThe opportunity afforded her the chance to fulfil her dream of returning to Africa to invest. Over the course of almost 5 years on the job, she saw firsthand the challenges women faced to raise capital for their businesses.\n\n\u201cI looked around and I saw that women were struggling to fundraise,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThere were no other women leading or running their own funds. And I thought, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201d She realized that in order to make a business case for investing in people like her, women needed examples of other women who had successfully run and led their own funds.\n\nShe began to corral her funds\u2014cashing in her JP Morgan bonuses, exiting her investments\u2014and in July 2019, she bought the African arm of Syntaxis Capital, rebranding it Aruwa Capital.\n\nThe name Aruwa, which is a wordplay on her name, also means \u201cwe are in prosperity\u201d in her native Edo language. Rhodes believes Aruwa speaks positively about the future about the impact her firm is going to have on the continent.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What were the early days of Aruwa Capital like?\n\nAdesuwa Okunbo Rhodes: From the onset, I decided that Aruwa will have a very specific gender lens focus, where we would invest in businesses that are past the idea stage. Businesses that have an existing route to market and have existing demand for their product or service, but require that capital to scale up to the next stage.\n\nThese are businesses that need anywhere between $500,000 to $2.5 million dollars investment. That\u2019s our ticket size.\n\nWhat I mean by a gender lens focus is that these businesses are either founded or co-founded or led by women or gender diverse teams, or these businesses produce goods or services that positively impact women.\n\nWe see the female economy as a $15 trillion market and women are making 80% of consumer spending decisions. So as a woman that\u2019s allocating capital and investing, I\u2019m best placed to invest in the best businesses that are providing solutions to problems that I\u2019m facing as a woman.\n\nWe launched a $20 million fund to do that. In October 2019, I was able to start the fund with some friends and family money and we invested in our first deal, a deal called Wemy Industries, which is a local manufacturer of personal hygiene goods. Think baby diapers, baby wipes, we have the only adult diaper in West Africa. That business is doing very well since we\u2019ve invested in it. We\u2019ve managed to bring on private equity funds, the same funds that told us the deal was too small when we were looking at it back in October 2019. The second investment was in a company called LifeStores Pharmacy, a health tech business, in April 2021. We\u2019ve also invested in Png.me, a business to business (B2B) fintech company co-founded by a woman in October, 2021.\n\nThe following month, we made our fourth investment in a company called AgroEknor, an exporter of superfoods that uses technology to control the value chain from end to end. We\u2019ve also invested in fintech company Crowdforce, leading the round with $1 million, and Koolboks.\n\nWe\u2019ve now done 6 investments and had to increase the size of our fund to $25 million, just based on the interest that we\u2019ve seen. Our anchor in the fund is Visa Foundation. And we\u2019re looking to close the fund before the end of the second quarter this year.\n\nDA: What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nAOR: We\u2019re not a typical VC firm. We\u2019re not doing seed or pre-seed. We\u2019re doing what I call pre-private equity. These are businesses that have already proven the business model. They already have an existing market, but they\u2019re too small for the private equity fund. And that\u2019s really where the majority of activity is happening. They also have to be companies in one of these four sector verticals: health care, fintech, renewable energy, or essential consumer goods.\n\nWe say to our investors that that\u2019s the sweet spot, because these businesses are already de-risked to some extent, but they need investors like us to institutionalize them by providing them with growth capital. They need investors like us to provide them with the right corporate governance and structure to then attract larger private equity funds later on.\n\nI think a bigger objective for Aruwa is that we want to be an example of the magic that happens when women are empowered as capital allocators. We have less than 10 private equity funds in the whole of Africa run by women and possibly even fewer funds run by African women. So I\u2019m very passionate about telling that story because as you invest in more women as capital allocators, there\u2019s a natural trickle-down effect to women in our portfolio.\n\nThe increased gender diversity that happens in our portfolio enhances the profitability of our businesses and enhances the returns of our fund. We\u2019ve now seen so much research from Harvard and BCG, that talks about improved performance of female founders and the enhanced returns profitability of gender diversity in executive management teams and founding teams. We\u2019re really just trying to showcase the competitive advantage of having women as capital allocators in a market of very limited competition, where we can invest in those that are overlooked on top opportunities.\n\nI\u2019m sure you saw the statistics: less than 1% of the VC funding last year went to women. I see that as a huge arbitrage opportunity. We\u2019re investing where no one else is looking. And we can be very selective and cherry-pick the best investments that help us to enhance and maximize returns for our investors, but also contribute very positively to society by increasing jobs and empowering women.\n\nWe\u2019re very excited about really pioneering the space of early-stage equity growth and gender lens investing.\n\nDA: What has been your experience investing in women-led/focused businesses?\n\nAOR: I think there\u2019s definitely still a need for education. We\u2019re typically investing in businesses that have already proven themselves. They have a diverse trajectory. So giving up equities and valuation is always a conversation.\n\nBefore we became well known in the market, in those earlier days, people were like, \u201cWho is Aruwa?\u201d We had to try to convince people of the value that we can bring.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to build our reputation and trust with companies. Now that we\u2019ve done 6 investments and have examples, it\u2019s a little bit easier to be able to convince entrepreneurs to give their equity to us because it\u2019s a marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s a 5-year marriage, or at least a 2- or 3-year marriage of building up the trust of entrepreneurs because we always say that we\u2019re not just coming with money. We\u2019re providing more than just the money. We\u2019re a partner that would help you scale up your business.\n\nAt the beginning, when we were a new name, it took a little bit longer, but I think now with examples of what we\u2019ve done for other companies, it makes each conversation a lot easier.\n\nDA: Investing in 6 companies over the span of 2 years sounds slow and deliberate. Tell me about this approach?\n\nAOR: We don\u2019t write deals within 24 to 48 hours. We take our time. Our process can take anywhere between 3\u20136 months. We\u2019re not a spray and pray VC model.\n\nThis is our first fund, so the returns of this fund are going to determine how the assets under management and return on investment are built for the next 30 to 50 years. So we\u2019re very intentional about the deals that we\u2019re doing and we take our time to do the due diligence required. For us, it was record-breaking to do 5 deals in one year in the private equity world, but in the VC world, obviously, you\u2019re doing like 20 to 30 deals in a year, so it\u2019s a little bit different. For us, it\u2019s a good year if we\u2019re able to do 3 to 4 deals.\n\nWe\u2019re not cutting corners or shortcutting the process. It\u2019s just different because of the stage that we\u2019re investing in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the VC model. It\u2019s just a different approach because in VC deals you can base it on your knowledge of the market and a gut feel of the founders.\n\nDA: How do these companies find you?\n\nAOR: We\u2019ve been inundated with requests since July 2019. We\u2019ve got over a billion dollars worth of deals in our inbox. There\u2019s a lot of demand for the capital that we\u2019re providing. So people reach out to me on LinkedIn or via our email address (info@aruwacapital.com) or my email address. I don\u2019t know how people get my email, but they also reach out to me on my email.\n\nDA: What are some red flags you look out for when investing?\n\nAOR: We want to invest in a team with a bench. We don\u2019t like to invest in businesses that don\u2019t have a strong management team. We\u2019re very conscious of making sure that the CEO has the right support across all the different layers of the business: finance, operations, sales, etc.\n\nAnother thing we look for is ways to make sure that the team has skin in the game. So I think it\u2019s a red flag if the founder or the team haven\u2019t invested any money, even if it\u2019s a friend or family round. If they quit their job or give up salary positions, that also counts. You know when people act like that, it shows their seriousness. It\u2019s not just money that counts as skin in the game. Time and commitment also count.\n\nI don\u2019t like it when founders don\u2019t know their numbers\u2014revenues, margins. You should be able to talk intelligently about your numbers because it just shows that you know your business inside out.\n\nDA: You said you invest in teams. Do you invest in single founders?\n\nAOR: Yeah, we could invest in a single founder, just make sure you have a team around you that can support and you should be able to delegate. I\u2019m a single founder. I don\u2019t discriminate against single founders.\n\nDA: Are there any deals you\u2019ve missed out on?\n\nAOR: Yeah, they definitely exist. When you spend 4 years fundraising you miss out on a lot of deals. For example, investing in Trade Depot was a deal that I wished I did but at the time, we didn\u2019t have capital and we missed out on them.\n\nI\u2019m someone who believes that everything happens for a reason. So I don\u2019t really have many regrets. If God didn\u2019t want it to happen, it didn\u2019t happen for reasons. We just keep it moving.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nAOR: There\u2019s a lot of hype and excitement right now, but in my personal opinion there won\u2019t be as many winners as many people think. Yes, the market is large, unsaturated, and we still have a lot of opportunities, but you can\u2019t have 8 players in the same vertical chasing the same market. There are going to be a few winners.\n\nFor us, our focus is essential goods and services. So businesses that are providing essential goods such as health care, financial services, renewable energy and access to power, and essential consumer goods. We think that with an election year coming up and with a lot of macroeconomic instability there should be a focus on the goods and services that people always need.\n\nSo essentials, I think that\u2019s something that over the next 10, 20, or 30 years, as we have a more rapidly growing urban African population, it\u2019s not going to be a fad. And I think we have some fads that are happening in the market right now. A focus on essential goods and services is a good strategy for any investor to have in this kind of market.\n\nIn addition, note that it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market right now. So be aware of the hype. If the valuation doesn\u2019t make sense, don\u2019t do the deal. We have to be very selective and intentional to create our own deals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup Swvl, has announced plans to lay off a third of its workforce. The cut will affect 400 people, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Youssef Salem told Bloomberg.\n\nThis announcement was revealed in a letter sent to Swvl employees by CEO Mostafa Kandil on May 30. In the letter, Kandil explained that the effects of the recent global economic downturn have influenced the company\u2019s decision to be Cash Flow positive by 2023.\n\nSwvl, whose merger with Queen\u2019s Gambit Growth Capital in April landed it a valuation of $1.5 billion, became the first African startup to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Since the merger, however, Swvl has lost more than half of that number and is now valued at $581 million.\n\n\u201cNo matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized,\u201d CEO Kandil wrote.\n\nIn addition to this layoff, Kandil added that the company has taken other measures such as the voluntary salary deductions from the top management team; reduction of current office spaces; freezing its current hiring program, as well as travel and accommodation expenses.\n\nSwvl is present in 115 cities and 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. A source disclosed to TechCrunch, that the majority of the layoffs will come from the company\u2019s Dubai and Pakistan offices. The layoffs will focus on roles automated by investments in the Company\u2019s engineering and product and support functions, according to a statement from SWVl.\n\nThe startup has been on an acquisitions spree in the last year, acquiring 4 international startups: UK\u2019s Zeelo, Germany\u2019s door2door, Turkey\u2019s Voltlines, Spain\u2019s Shotl and Argentina\u2019s Viapool.\n\nOver the past 2 months, the economic downturn has forced tech companies across the globe to lay off significant numbers of their workforce.\n\nThis month, Meta and Uber have announced that they\u2019re freezing hiring plans while Netflix laid off 2% of its workforce\u2014about 150 employees and Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna cut its workforce by 10%.\n\nOver 15,000 tech workers were laid off in May, as startups heed advice from tech investors including Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital to buckle up for hard times and plan for the worst.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Victoria Fabunmi helps startup founders get capital to drive growth",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, precious little was known about Nigeria\u2019s startup ecosystem and Africa by extension. Not only was nothing known about it, there was little activity going on, but few Africans believed that the sector was crucial to the continent\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nOne of them was Bosun Tijani, and later that year, he co-founded CcHUB with Femi Longeto to support entrepreneurs using technology to solve the continent\u2019s problems. From its beginnings in Lagos, Nigeria, it now has hubs in Rwanda and Kenya and has helped hundreds of African startups with funding, workspaces, networks, and knowledge.\n\nThis week on Equity Merchants, Techpoint Africa speaks with Victoria Fabunmi, Head of Investment at CcHUB, and she shares her thoughts on investing in Africa.\n\nSearching for impact\n\nLike many university graduates, Victoria Fabunmi was unsure what direction her career would take. However, the graduate of accounting from the University of Lagos knew she wanted a career that allowed her to make an impact on society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to do this was to bridge the financing gap for businesses, and so she began a career in investment banking.\n\nAfter nine years as an investment banker, she was ready for a new challenge, this time bridging the financing gap for startup founders through her role as an investment manager at CcHub.\n\nAs the Head of Investment, Fabunmi leads CcHUB\u2019s sector-agnostic investments in startups that come through its pipelines and early-stage startups that meet its investment criteria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sector agnostic, so we invest across sectors. We look for companies leveraging technology to build infrastructure in their given vertical, hoping that they can provide access at scale. So when I say access at scale, think about education.\n\n\u201cEducation should be something that everyone should access, but quality education is still something a lot of people don\u2019t have access to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fabunmi. Source: LinkedIn\n\nWith CcHUB investing at the early stages of a startup\u2019s journey, there is little data for investors to use in decision making. Fabunmi points out that she considers specific criteria when deciding to invest in a startup.\n\n\u201cThe numbers might not be there. But I think there are qualitative factors that we can look at in terms of selecting the startups.\u201d\n\nFounders, for example, need to understand the space they are playing in or have advisors that do, while they also need to have traction, regardless of how little. The size of the market is also key, as not all startups are ideal for VC investments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent years, the age of founders seems to have reduced, with more people starting businesses straight out of school or even before getting into the university.\n\nIf you\u2019re straight out of school and you want to come into VC, look for affordable courses on Udemy that teach you about financial models, be willing to network and meet people, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet someone who wants you on their team. Victoria fabunmi (tweet this)\n\nHigh unemployment rates also mean that most of these founders have little to no experience in the industries they are building in. Consequently, Fabunmi reveals that investors must consider the founder\u2019s character and the factors mentioned above.\n\nGetting your first job in venture capital\n\nUntil only a few years ago, a career in venture capital was not something that many Africans considered. However, it has gradually grown as more homegrown funds are launched, and Fabunmi has some tips for anyone looking to land their first VC roles.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, you have to be a people person because you have to get the founders to trust you. So you have to be a people person.\n\n\u201cYou have to be willing to learn, unlearn, and relearn in terms of how quickly things evolve. You must also understand what\u2019s happening in the ecosystem, collecting and processing data quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo during a visit to CcHUB\n\nBut soft skills are not all you need to get a job in venture capital. Hard skills such as financial analysis and modelling are valuable, especially for entry-level positions.\n\n\u201cVery early on, you\u2019ll be required to do some financial modelling or analysis. In fact, most VCs require that you have some skills when it comes to numbers. But as you go through the ranks, perhaps, they might not be as relevant.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re straight out of school and you want to come into VC, look for affordable courses on Udemy that teach you about financial models, be willing to network and meet people, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet someone who wants you on their team.\u201d\n\nThe evolution of Nigeria\u2019s startup landscape\n\nIn 2021, a day hardly passed without an African startup announcing its fundraise, but it was not always like that. At some point, getting $1 million at Series A was a dream, but several pre-seed startups have raised higher amounts. That\u2019s just one way the startup space has grown since Fabunmi joined CcHUB.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined, cheque sizes were smaller, and the definition of stages was different. Now you have pre-seed, seed, seed plus, and all sorts of terminology. Then it was very clear what metrics you had to be doing at every stage, but all that has changed.\u201d victoria fabunmi (tweet this)\n\nWhile cheque sizes have grown, Fabunmi notes that more African founders are building products for the global market while the talent gap has gotten wider with more startups competing for scarce talent.\n\nLocalising African investments and building for a global market\n\nAccording to Techpoint Africa\u2019s Nigerian Startup Funding Report 2020, 71.2% of investments received by Nigerian startups in 2020 came from outside Africa. It was worse for West African startups, with 81.3% external funding, and Fabunmi admits that it is a phenomenon that worries her.\n\nHowever, she concedes that startup investing is a little known asset class in Africa, and it would take some time to get most local investors to see it as a good investment. In the meantime, she believes that more work needs to be done to have more homegrown fund managers.\n\n\u201cIt will take a while to get more people to come on board this train, but it does worry me that most of the investments come from outside the continent. The hope is that we begin to develop more homegrown fund managers that can deploy enough capital to these innovative companies to keep them on the continent.\u201d\n\nOne of the advantages of building tech-enabled businesses is the possibility of creating a product that is used globally. The likes of Facebook, Twitter, and PayPal are some examples of startups that have a global audience.\n\nHowever, only a handful of companies built in Africa can boast of a global audience, and Fabunmi believes that it\u2019s only a matter of time before we begin to see such companies on the continent.\n\n\u201cIt takes a very unique founder to build global products. It\u2019s almost like an out-of-body experience, where you\u2019re thinking about a unique problem that can be solved across the globe. I think we\u2019ll continue to see founders like that emerge, especially with all the programmes on the continent laying the foundation for them to emerge.\u201d\n\nBuilding sustainable businesses\n\nA lot of effort goes into building sustainable businesses. Not only must the right team be assembled, but the right structures also need to be put in place, or the business risks failing. There have been stories about the terrible work culture in some startups and accusations of shoddy due diligence by investors in recent times.\n\nThese are all crucial issues, and Fabunmi believes that investors have a role in creating a great environment for businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cI think investors have a significant role to play. We\u2019re in a clime where if you say something your founder doesn\u2019t like, the next thing is you\u2019re tagged as not founder-friendly, but investors should not be afraid of calling out things that could harm the company.\n\n\u201cHopefully, as the ecosystem matures, corporate governance will become something everyone embraces easily. We would either have founders looking for it from day one of investment \u2014 and it\u2019s a criterion for accepting an investor \u2014 or more investors are willing to play that role of demanding certain things in a startup\u2019s organisational culture.\u201d\n\nThe team an entrepreneur assembles to build a product would often determine its success, and few team members have as much impact as co-founders. About 65% of high potential startups fail due to co-founder conflict. Therefore, getting this decision right is essential.\n\nFabunmi advocates for co-founders to have a great relationship that ensures that they can resolve conflict when it arises. Additionally, they should ideally have different strengths and complement each other, while a founders\u2019 agreement can be used to protect the company\u2019s future.\n\nAs the due diligence process is often non-negotiable for investors, she offers insights into what investors want to see. She advises founders to get started before seeking investments. This includes having a team that can handle the business in the founders\u2019 absence and a great understanding of the market. Where this deep expertise is absent, she believes that founders who are open to feedback are attractive to investors.\n\nCollaborating to bridge the talent gap\n\nIn addition to accessing finance, most African founders frequently lament about their inability to hire the right talent. Businesses such as Gebeya, AltSchool, and Andela have launched with varying approaches to solve this problem. However, there has been little cooperation between academia and the tech industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabunmi shares that a collaboration between the industry and academia is crucial to maintaining a steady talent pool for the tech industry. Already, CcHUB has partnered with the Tai Solarin University of Education to build an Edtech Center of Excellence. Still, she believes that more is required before the industry can fill the talent gap.\n\nFor founders looking to raise capital, Fabunmi advises that they understand the intricacies of their business and why they want to raise money. She also suggests that they build relationships with investors long before they need them while working to ensure they can be trusted.\n\nSome of her favourite books and movies include Vikings, King of Boys, The Intelligent Investor, and The Lean Startup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Well, not immediately; you still have to finish reading this newsletter, of course.\n\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s outline:\n\nJoram Mwinamo\u2019s journey in tech\n\nCutting edge innovations in Africa\n\nMobility in Lagos\n\nJoram Mwinamo\u2019s journey in tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m about to tell you a secret; can you keep one? Well, I\u2019ll let you know anyways. Techpoint Africa\u2018s editorial team is cooking! \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis Monday, I talked about the return of the How I Work series. Did you read Samuel\u2019s article on how Peace Itimi, a digital marketing professional and trainer, works?\n\nThere\u2019s more where that came from. And this week, there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nLet me give you a sneak peek. Nifemi, our Senior Reporter, recently added something new to her series, The Experts. A podcast!! While I was listening, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, we are widening your horizons options. If you don\u2019t want to read, you can listen. Although we won\u2019t stop you if you\u2019d like to listen and read. \ud83d\ude09\n\nDid you know she has a newsletter? If you didn\u2019t, then you definitely want to sign up.\n\nShare the link with your friends, family, and haters curious about how techies progress from novice to expert and everything in between. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate it.\n\nBack to the podcast: I won\u2019t say I was surprised to see it because you must have heard her speak on the Techpoint Africa Podcast.\n\nI mean, the voice, the sound, the story, and the emotions are fantastic. Good Lord, I felt like crying. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 You just need to listen! And if you disagree after listening, of course, please let me know by leaving a comment in the comments section. \ud83d\ude01\n\nBy the way, do you know anyone so passionate about what they do that no matter how unrelated a topic of discussion is, they always circle back to it? Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know anyone like this. Nifemi has brought such a person to your screen. \ud83d\ude05\n\nPlease, meet Joram Mwinamo, a Kenyan expert who always talks about the potential of technology and how he\u2019s been helping businesses tap into it by enabling them to make sense of the problem from a human perspective.\n\nInterestingly, he was exposed to computers as a child and has a degree in computer science. One would think he\u2019d become a computer scientist or a web developer, but it appears \u201cfate had another path for him.\u201d Hello, those are my words. \ud83d\ude01\n\nHis involvement in AIESEC, an organisation that promotes cultural exchange and professional and leadership development, as an undergraduate paved the way.\n\nAnd now, Joram is a seasoned entrepreneur who believes that if a founder is only good at building a product and terrible at everything else, the startup\u2019s overall success suffers.\n\nDo you believe that\u2019s correct? Why not read his story to learn more about his philosophy and journey into tech? Here you go: How Joram Mwinamo has helped Kenyans make sense of their businesses since 2007\n\nCutting edge innovations in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nRecently, most big tech companies seem to be enamoured with investing in Africa. While this should not be a cause for concern because it is business, it slightly worries me.\n\nI mean, is the African market that profitable or are we lacking that we require someone to rescue us from poverty, a lack of job opportunities, or low Internet penetration? \ud83d\ude02 Okay, that\u2019s all in my head, though. Still, these companies are helping.\n\nFor example, Microsoft opened its first Africa Development Centre to attract top-tier African technical talent to create cutting-edge solutions.\n\nAlso, Google announced plans to open its first Product Development Center in Kenya to create more job opportunities on the continent.\n\nKeep in mind that Google intends to change our Internet experience by launching Equiano, a cutting-edge subsea cable. Yes, the one promised by Google to have 112Mbps Internet speed.\n\nWhile these developments appear to be interesting, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, believes that Google should be doing more for Africa. Interesting, innit?\n\nGoogle has been developing initiatives in Africa for quite some time. For context, Emmanuel, our Senior Reporter, provided examples of the company\u2019s innovations on the continent since 2019 in his most recent story yesterday, May 31, 2022.\n\nIn his conversation with Pichai, he also revealed Google\u2019s plan for innovation in Africa and why its Pixel smartphones might still remain expensive for users on the continent for a while.\n\nWell, I\u2019m not giving you any more sneak peeks. For more information, please read: Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, on cutting edge innovation in Africa\n\nMobility in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, May 23, 2022, the Lagos State government warned residents to be cautious of unlicensed e-hailing cab operators operating within the state because they pose a security risk to people and property.\n\nWhy? According to Dr Fredrick Oladeinde, Commissioner for Transportation, unlicensed operators lack a traceable operational base in the event of an emergency or safety concern.\n\nBesides, the Commissioner said that \u201cthe only lawful operators recognised by the state government and licensed to operate in Lagos are Lagos Ride, Uber, Bolt, Let Me Run, Global Taxi, Zoom Run, Treepz (PlentyWaka), and Shuttlers.\u201d\n\nConsequently, any other e-hailing cab operators are not approved by the Lagos State government.\n\nFurther, Oladeinde said that the government would soon begin a crackdown on illegal e-hailing cab operators in its efforts to make Lagos a safe place for all.\n\nStill on safety in Lagos State, the state government has established an Anti-Okada Squad to enforce the ban on okada riders, which is set to begin today, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.\n\nWhy this squad? Oladeinde stated yesterday, May 31, 2022, that the goal of establishing the squad is to ensure effective enforcement of the ban.\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Police Command stated that the motorcycle ban in the six Local Government Areas \u2014 Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, and Apapa \u2014 will be strictly enforced, adding that any resistance will be met with force in accordance with the law.\n\nRecall that on May 18, 2022, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, declared a total and indefinite ban on okadas in those areas. This is similar to the state\u2019s ban in 2020 on all okada and tricycles (keke), including platforms like Max, ORide, and Gokada, on major highways.\n\nWhile a policy expert answered some of our burning questions about the 2020 ban, isn\u2019t it time we started having discussions that can help to shape the narrative of tech-enabled mobility in Lagos, Nigeria and Africa at large?\n\nIf you agree, then join the inaugural Africa Mobility Conference taking place tomorrow, June 2, 2022, by 9 a.m. To be a part of the conversation, register here.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA familiar trend in recent years has seen big tech companies announce cutting edge innovations in key markets. For years Africa has barely featured in the conversation, but all that is changing, and Google is playing a big part.\n\nIn 2021, Google announced a $1 billion fund for Africa, an investment that would involve the launch of Equiano, a state of the art subsea cable that promises to change how Africans experience the Internet. It also included a fund for African startups and SMEs among other things.\n\nAt the 2022 Google I/O conference, the tech giant made some exciting announcements that seemingly made all its previous announcements come full circle. In an unprecedented move, Google invited Techpoint Africa for a chat with its CEO to address issues on Google\u2019s innovative efforts in Africa.\n\nIf you just started following tech stories in 2021, it would probably surprise you to know that Google has been launching a number of initiatives across Africa with a majority of them geared toward connectivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had the defunct Google free WiFi initiative and Project Loon. One involved installing stations to access the Internet for free, while the other sought to make use of the air balloons to beam Internet signals to remote locations in Kenya.\n\nIn 2019, Google opened its first African artificial intelligence lab in Accra, Ghana to solve basic everyday problems for Africans. Some of these solutions were AI models deployed on phones to diagnose crop diseases.\n\nThe following year, Google launched plus codes, a unique identifier that was basically a street address for people who don\u2019t have one. For a continent like Africa with a fragmented addressing system, this had numerous benefits for different sectors like logistics, health, and governance (read census and elections).\n\nDespite all these initiatives, Sundar Pichai still believes that Google should be doing more for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have a renewed focus on Africa. In some ways, we\u2019re using a template which has worked well in other countries. For instance, in other parts of the world, we\u2019ve announced a focused development fund, over a period of time. And which works on many pillars like small businesses, digital skilling, AI centres and talent.\u201d\n\nRecall that in January 2022, Google announced a $1 billion fund in India to provide affordable access to smartphones and speed up the uptake of cloud computing. This is eerily similar to the $1 billion Africa development fund which Pichai says has been a big focus for the company.\n\nWhile the Indian fund saw the company partner with Bharti Airtel, its recent launch of Equiano has seen partnerships with up to 10 major African telcos. The focus on networking and the launch of a product development centre in Kenya also hints at a major cloud computing future.\n\nBeyond connectivity, Google\u2019s efforts are seemingly geared toward plugging infrastructure gaps in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Google maps have ever left you stranded before, that\u2019s mainly a symptom of Africa\u2019s informal housing system which we referenced above. According to the World Bank, African cities face a major housing challenge with the increase in urban slums. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 20% of the people living in slums.\n\nIn 2021, the tech behemoth used Artificial Intelligence to map up to 300 million buildings in Africa, five times more than the 60 million recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening up the datasets for the World Bank and the United Nations so they can use this data for their programs,\u201d Google\u2019s CEO reveals, adding that, \u201c the moment is right for Africa and increasing Internet penetration, the entrepreneurship we\u2019re seeing, and access to technology and training will position it well.\u201d\n\nOn Google\u2019s platforms in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Google\n\nBesides infrastructure plays, one of Google\u2019s iconic platforms, the Android OS is incredibly popular in Africa. Stats counter states that more than half of African smartphone users use the Android platform.\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s flagship Android phone, Google Pixel, has struggled to make inroads in Africa.\n\nAt the Google I/O conference, the company announced the addition of several initiatives including the Pixel 6a which officially costs just a little more than \u20a6200,000 ($499). But if the pricing of the Pixel 6 gives us any indication, then it would be significantly more expensive in Nigeria. For context, the Pixel 6 officially cost \u20a6250,000 ($599) at launch, but Nigerian retailers typically sold the pixel between \u20a6400,000 \u2013 \u20a6500,000 ($1,000 \u2013 $1,200).\n\nPichai revealed that supply constraints have prevented the Pixel from fully launching in Africa and several other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you do hardware, it\u2019s not enough, if you launch in a country. You have to invest in a supporting cast of things. You need to have retail partnerships, you have to have deep carrier partnerships, you have to make sure some localized content is available, and you have to make sure you have a marketing program that works in that country.\u201d\n\nPichai says the focus has been on scaling it country by country. Spreading Pixel to Europe, India, and Japan. However, Africa might need a very different strategy.\n\n\u201cPixel is at a higher price point for Africa, so the work we\u2019re doing with original equipment manufacturers is very very important, and that has become a big, big focus for us as well.\u201d\n\nAt $499 The Pixel 6a is the cheapest in Google\u2019s latest phone lineup. By comparison, the global behemoth, Samsung, retails the Galaxy AO3 at \u20a645,000 ($108). Pichai\u2019s statement foreshadows more affordable pixel phones that would be targeted at the African market.\n\nHowever, Africa still has a long way to go regarding innovation, and Google appears to be playing the long game for now. Its fledgeling YouTube creator program, and its privacy policies which have allowed loan sharks to run amok present positive and negative aspects of using Google\u2019s products in Africa. From all indications, Africa is about to hit a new era with big tech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and narrator of technology, business and policies in Africa . Looking to chat?

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based company, Vault Hill, has launched its NFT marketplace with the public sale of land in its human-centric metaverse, Vault Hill City (VHC). The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator established to foster the growth of crypto-native projects in Africa, today announced its investment into a seed funding round for Cassava Network, a blockchain infrastructure that empowers African content creators, developers, and end-users through mutually aligned tasks and incentives. Over 40 investors, including Dragonfly, CMT Digital, YGG, Mirana, etc., participated in the recently closed investment round to implement the next phase of Cassava platform development.\n\nAdaverse was launched in September 2021 as a joint venture partnership between EMURGO Africa and Everest Ventures, to identify and provide valuable support resources to promising African founders building the next wave of Web3 dApps in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse tools on Cardano\u2019s third-generation and environmentally-sustainable blockchain.\n\nWhat is Cassava Network?\n\nCassava is a blockchain infrastructure that connects developers and users to the Web3 ecosystem. Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement.

And what we\u2019re having now have been assembled from the output of the end user that is the Nigerian police force. And we believe by the time these items are on ground, they will go a long way in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Nigerian police in the maintenance of peace and security in the country.\n\nThe Abubakar Aliyu, the Minister of power, revealed that the Council granted approval of a contract to supply and install emergency restoration system of 330 kV and 132KV transmission line for ongoing rehabilitation works in Lagos at the sum of $968,818 as the offshore component and an onshore component of N7,393 million, to be executed by Rab Power Industries Limited.\n\nHe also announced an approval of variation of contract for Katsina power project following escalation of the onshore component of construction materials.\n\nRead also: Boost for Nigeria\u2019s oil production as exports of Forcados crude rise in July\n\n\u201c The sum is N445,326,643.12 and the subsisting contract amount on the offshore is not affected.\n\n\u201cThe onshore which was N939,410,664 has now moved to N1.938,737,307.12 and the Council graciously approved\u201d\n\nThe Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) limited, received approval to execute a memorandum of understanding with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria, Morocco gas pipeline, this pipeline is to take gas to 15 West African countries and to Morocco and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved the construction of a switchgear room, an installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria oil and gas park in Ogbehia Bayelsa state in the sum of N3.8 billion. this park is to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved various contracts for the construction of an access road with bridges to the brass petroleum product depot in Nibomoyekiri in brass local government in the sum of N11 billion plus 7.5% VAT.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, disclosed that her Ministry presented the economic reports of the first quarter of 2022 GDP to the Council.\n\nThe report had shown that the Nigerian economy has grown by 3.1% in the first quarter of 2022. Compared to a growth of 0.5% in the first quarter of last year. This growth shows a gradual economic stability from the recession that we witnessed in 2020. And also it shows the six quarter of positive growth that the Nigerian economy has presented.\n\nShe disclosed that of the 46 economic activities, the bulk sector performance show that services sector grew strongly by 4.7%, agriculture also grew by 3.61%.\n\n\u201cIndustry on the other hand contracted by minus 6.81%. And there\u2019s also a significant contraction in the crude oil, petroleum and natural gas sector of 26.04%. Coal mining sector also declined, oil refinery the biggest contraction of 44.26%. electricity sector, textile outcome. therefore, even though there has been growth in some sectors, there are significant contraction than others but the net effect is positive growth\u201d\n\nShe stated that the Ministry has been \u201cvery mindful of the fact that unless we have most of the sectors growing especially the growth in the jobs impacted sectors, that this growth that is positive will not be directly felt by the people. We also reported to council that inflation has started going upward to the extent that the monetary authorities the central bank have had to adjust the NPR to 13% in the last MPC that they have met, and that\u2019s an attempt to manage the cost of inflation\u201d\n\nAccording to her \u201c the Council decided to set up special team to look at the sectors that are not growing and also to look at how we can grow the other sectors better.\n\n\u201cCouncil has also decided that the National Food Security Council will very quickly meet to address the issue of food inflation, and also provide a plan and some methods in which we can reduce the cost of food to support improved food prices for the citizens\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the concession agreement approved by FEC in September 2020 in favour of e-customs HC project limited, the Minister stated that a concession agreement approved the E-customs project by Council earlier, \u201cmet some challenges that had to do with disagreements between the concession partners.\n\n\u201cRemember that government was not a partner of the concession, it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium\u201d\n\nShe disclosed that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice has intervene, after several meetings to try to iron out the difference.\n\n\u201cSo it has to do with shareholder who has what responsibility. And at the end of the day, I think one of the partners in the concession did not agree with the arrangements. So the partner that signed was already in the initial concession. So that\u2019s one party that did not agree with the terms that are signed. And there is a new agreement that has not been signed that partner was reported to have opted out of the concession.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the report yet but it was reported to have opted out of being in the concession. So there is a new concession agreement that has been committed. And to on the part of the ministry and I know Custom, what it means is that the implementation of E-customs project can now start with this resolution\u201d.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "2023: APC stakeholders slam Buhari for wanting to chose successor",
          "text": "Some stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have berated President Muhammadu Buhari over his request to the party\u2019s governors to allow him pick his successor ahead of Monday\u2019s Presidential Convention of the party.\n\nThey wondered if the president is now being influenced by the antics of state governors who often resort to imposing their stooges as successors, saying the president is supposed to be a moral compass to the state chief executives.\n\nThe stakeholders who spoke under aegis of APC Rebirth Group, said President Buhari\u2019s desire to reciprocate gestures must not compromise the party\u2019s internal democratic processes.\n\nAt a media parley in Abuja, Convener of the group, Engr. Aliyu Audu conceded that the stakeholders recognize the inalienable rights of the president to be interested in whoever succeeds him and the natural desire to reciprocate the gesture of support he received in his 2014 bid to be the party\u2019s flag bearer for the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe stakeholders however opined that \u201cthe choice of the president should not amount to an imposition or foreclose the chances of a free and fair contest where the candidate who reflects all the values and virtues of the party and has the potential to defeat the candidates of other political parties will be democratically elected\u201d.\n\nThey also painfully recalled how the current National Chairman of the party was imposed on stakeholders in the lead up to the March 26 national convention.\n\nThe stakeholders said; \u201cWe say this because the memories of what transpired at the last national convention of the party where the president picked his choice for the position of the National Chairman and literally forced the other aspirants to step down in a manner that can best be described as an imposition is still very fresh.\n\n\u201cIn a January 6, 2022 interview with the Nigerian Television Authority NTA, the president stated clearly that he would not play the role of a kingmaker in the choice of his successor and any other elective office, just as he stated that he tried about three times to contest for President before he emerged, and so anyone that wants to become the next president should also work for it.\n\n\u201cBarely a month ago, while fielding questions from journalists after observing the Eid-el-Fitr prayers in Abuja, the president equally said that he has no favourite candidate for the 2023 Presidential election. Instead, he said the one who would succeed him is \u2018the person that Nigerians elect\u2019.\n\n\u201cOur understanding of this statement is that the Nigerian he referred to include members of the All Progressives Congress through direct or indirect process should also elect whoever they want to fly the flag of the party in the general elections.\n\n\u201cOne then wonders what has informed the change of position of the president on how his successor or any other elected official should emerge. If he is influenced by what is obtainable at the states where governors brazenly handpick aspirants at different elections, then it is imperative to remind the president that he is supposed to be the moral compass for us as members of the party and Nigerians as a whole. As the president and leader of the party, it is a moral responsibility that he sets examples for the governors and future elected leaders to emulate and not the other way round.\n\n\u201cThe best legacy President Muhammadu Buhari can leave for the APC and Nigeria as a whole is the legacy of a deeply entrenched democratic process where Nigerians can freely choose who represents them at whatever level in free, fair, credible and transparent processes. This legacy must manifest from the All Progressives Congress which prides itself as a party with progressives ideals different from the other stocks.\n\n\u201cIf the so called \u2018established internal policies\u2019 of succession in the party fulfils all democratic criteria, we would not be having as much crisis in the party as we have witnessed in recent times. As we speak, the ongoing primary elections of the party across the country which ought to have been concluded are still subject of infighting in a number of places. Is this the kind of legacy the president wants to leave behind?\n\n\u201cAs someone who came in through a free, fair and credibly contested democratic process in 2015 and also won re-election through the same process in 2019, the president must not only ensure that this standard is maintained, he must keep to his own words and advice as vividly expressed in the January 6 interview on the Nigeria Television Authority that the APC must conduct itself properly and \u2018allow the system to work\u2019.\n\n\u201cAt this point in the life of the APC, winning the 2023 presidential election is equally as important as who flies the flag of the party in the election, especially if protecting the legacies that the Muhammadu Buhari led APC administration has put in place in the last 7 years is of great concern. What guarantees victory for many political parties is not just who the candidates are, but the process through which they emerge. If the process is flawed so much as to leave members disenchanted, you are already on your way to losing the election.\n\n\u201cFor the APC to avoid finding itself on this path, it must not make the mistake of forcing anyone on the party in whatever guise. The president is free and has the right to have his choice of candidate, but let everyone be made to test their popularity in the field so that representatives of the party in the form of delegates will choose who they deem to be the best, more qualified and popular to win us the 2023 presidential election\u201d, the stakeholders added.",
          "summary": "Some stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have berated President Muhammadu Buhari over his request to the party\u2019s governors to allow him pick his successor ahead of Monday\u2019s Presidential Convention of the party.\nThe stakeholders who spoke under aegis of APC Rebirth Group, said President Buhari\u2019s desire to reciprocate gestures must not compromise the party\u2019s internal democratic processes.\nThey also painfully recalled how the current National Chairman of the party was imposed on stakeholders in the lead up to the March 26 national convention.\nThis legacy must manifest from the All Progressives Congress which prides itself as a party with progressives ideals different from the other stocks.\n\u201cFor the APC to avoid finding itself on this path, it must not make the mistake of forcing anyone on the party in whatever guise.",

          "text": "First Bank of Nigeria Limited offers different range of products to support the agric business in its efforts to grow the nation\u2019s economy. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the bank\u2019s products targeted at growing agricultural business in the country.\n\nGlobally, the agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in the development of the economy of every country. The Nigeria agricultural policy provides among others, the adequate financing of agriculture. The primary goal of agricultural financing policies in Nigeria is to establish an efficient system of sustainable agricultural financing schemes, programme and institutions which could provide micro and macro credit facilities for the small , medium and large scale producers, processors as well as marketers.\n\nSupport for agriculture is widely driven by the public sector, which has established institutional support in form of agricultural research extension, commodity marketing , input supply, land use legislation to fast track development of agriculture in the country.\n\nBut successive governents in Nigeria at the federal, state and local levels have not been able to adequately address the specific constrains affecting the sector in an attempt to increase agricultural production in the country.\n\nAlthough, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its intervention funds and other schemes such as Anchor borrower, Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme among others has impacted positively to the growth of agricultural sector, but it is not enough for the sector to make significant contribution to net foreign exchange earnings for the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\nBenefits of agriculture\n\nAgriculture contributes immensely to the nation\u2019s economy in various ways. The sector provides food for the increasing population, supply adequate raw materials, land labour input to a growing industrial sector, a major source of employment, generation of foreign exchange earnings and provision of market for the products of the industrial sector.\n\nThe sector contributes 40 per cent of the Gross Domestic Products and employ about 70 per cent of the working population in Nigeria. Agriculture is also the largest economic activity in the rural areas where almost 50 per cent of the population lives.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s Agriculture Support Schemes\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Limited, Nigeria most valuable brand, offers a range of products and services designed to help agricultural business yield better results in the country.\n\nThe bank\u2019s products targeted at developing agriculture sector and other agric schemes introduced by federal government. Some of the products nclude; Maize Aggregation Scheme (MAS), Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facility (NESF), Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme, Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI) among others.\n\nThe essence of growing the sector is to enable it contribute its quota to the economic growth of the country.\n\nMaize Aggregation Scheme (MAS)\n\nThe Maize Aggregation Scheme (MAS) is for feed millers, poultry farmers, silos and warehouse operators and confectionery companies to enable them have access to affordable credit for the purchase of home-grown maize to promote the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s National Food Security Programme (NFSP).\n\nThe scheme was set up to Stabilize prices of maize and make its production profitable for farmers, Increase local production of maize, provide credit facilities to feed millers, poultry farmers, silo and warehouse operators, Integrated feed millers and confectionery companies using maize as their major component at single digit interest rate as well as enhance national food security.\n\nThe Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facility (NESF)\n\nThe Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facility (NESF)) was introduced by the CBN to diversify the revenue base of the economy and to expedite the growth and development of the non-oil export sector.\n\nThe facility designed to help redress the declining export financing and reposition the sector to increase its contribution to economic development. The fund comprises the short tenured working capital for 12 months as well as importation of plants & machinery for processing of exportable goods at all-in-interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. It is meant to improve export financing, increase access of exporters to low interest credit and offer additional opportunities for them to upscale and expand their businesses in addition to improving their competitiveness.\n\nFeatures/ target market\n\nThe fund has lending Limit of 70 per cent of the total cost of the project or transaction subject to a limit of N5 billion with a maximum single digit interest rate of 9 per cent, single obligor limit of up to N5 billion and fund will be available till 2027.\n\nAccording to available data from FirstBank\u2019s website, the eligible transactions that shall qualify for funding under the NESF shall include:export of goods processed or manufactured in Nigeria, export of commodities and services, which are allowed under the laws of Nigeria.\n\nImports of plant & machinery, spare parts and packaging materials required for export-oriented production that cannot be sourced locally, resuscitation, expansion, modernisation and technology upgrade of non-oil export.\n\nOthers are export value chain support services such as transportation, warehousing and quality assurance infrastructure, working capital/stocking facility, and structured trade finance arrangements.\n\nExport Facilitation Initiative (EFI).\n\nThe funding is to increase capacity in the industry for export and foreign exchange generation. The CBN and chief executive officers of banks approved the commencement of EFI at the 343rd bankers Committee meeting held in April 4th 2019 to compliment government effort to engender growth in the non-oil sector of the economy as well as enhance foreign earnings and employment generation in the cocoa, cashew and oil palm plantation production industry.\n\nThe funding is to increase capacity in the industry for export and foreign exchange generation. The fund attract single digit interest rate of nine per cent maximum with no obligor limit applicable. The fund has loan tenor of up to 10 years, up to three years moratorium period and the loan can be for land acquisition and cultivation, milling and refinery capacity or smallholder farmers aggregation.\n\nCommercial Agriculture Credit Scheme\n\nThe scheme is a special credit intervention fund of originally N200 billion created by the Federal Government of Nigeria to fast track the development of the agricultural sector of the economy by providing credit facilities to commercial agricultural enterprises at a single digit interest rate.\n\nThe key agricultural commodities covered under the scheme are production which include Cash crops: Cotton, Oil palm, fruit Trees. rubber, sugar cane, Jatropha curcas and Cocoa, Food Crops: Rice, Wheat, Cassava, Maize/Soya, Beans/Millet, Tomatoes and Vegetables, poultry: Broilers and Eggs productionL, ivestock: meat, Dairy and Piggery aquaculture: Fingerlings and Catfish .The fund will also used for processing and farm input supplies such as feed-mills development, threshing, pulverisation and other forms of transmutation for value addition.

The bank said Irrevocable Standing Payment Order (ISPO) is required in the case of State Governments while the fund will be available till 2025 with loan tenor of up to 5 years.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s view\n\nManaging Director, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, while speaking at the second edition of agric expo organised by the bank, said First Bank commenced operations over 124 years ago with a major strategic focus on financing agricultural development, as well as enabling farmers and agro-businesses.\n\nHe said the expo is indicative of bank\u2019s commitment to increasingly collaborate with public and private sector partners to fully restore the prime role of the agricultural sector as the mainstay of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that agricultural financing across all value chains remains a core part of our business today. Following our priority as a continuous financier of credit worthy agro-allied businesses, our team of dedicated agricultural professionals specialising in various fields of agriculture are strategically located to identify and support agricultural enterprises covering across all regions of Nigeria, with a suite of customised sector and customer friendly agricultural financing solutions.\n\n\u201cFirstBank has a large base of existing small, medium and commercial agribusiness clients across Nigeria operating in all segments of the agricultural value chain covering primary production, storage, processing, packaging and agro export, amongst others\u201d.\n\nAdeduntan said that in partnership with public sector institutions, the bank has supported several state governments on agricultural development trust fund scheme, an initiative designed to provide credit facilities to small scale farmers who do not have collateral.\n\n\u201cIndeed, under the Federal Government\u2019s Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme for long tenored credit facilities to commercial agricultural enterprises \u2013 at single digit interest rate \u2013 FirstBank has supported over 23 per cent of all the enterprises supported by all the banks put together. The projects spread across input supplies, primary production, processing and marketing. Obligors include small, medium and large scale enterprise in the agricultural value chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy that with these experiences, FirstBank worked immensely to support the Central Bank of Nigeria in actualizing the efforts of reviving all the value\u2013chains as envisioned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition, following the policy for playing down on importation of some of the commodities and encouragement of exportation of agricultural commodities, FirstBank is at the forefront of adopting the supportive schemes newly introduced by the Central Bank, like the Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facilities (NESF)\u201d, he concluded.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Going by the results of parties primaries conducted so far for 109 Senatorial seats, about 60 Senators have lost out on return bids, TAIYE ODEWALE, reports\n\nSeasonal turnovers\n\nFor both chambers of the National Assembly since 2003 when the first general elections were conducted under democratic governance in the current fourth republic, it has been high turnover of lawmakers after every successive Assembly in the mode of those returning falling below 50% of membership of a session that is ending.\n\nReasons for the high turnovers\n\nReasons for the high turnovers of membership of either the Senate or the House of Representatives as it happened at the end of 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th National Assembly are basically four.\n\nOne is decision by serving lawmakers to aim for higher political position, particularly, governorship of their states, two, effect of zoning arrangements from the senatorial district a lawmaker hails from, three, losing bid for return ticket at primary level and four, losing at the general elections. .\n\nSenate as case study\n\nSince 2003 as stated, it has been high turnover of members of the Senate not making it back after serving for one term at the end of a session.\n\nFor example, in the immediate past 8th Senate about 63 of the 109 Senators who served between June 2015 to June 2019 couldn\u2019t make it back to the current 9th Senate due to the four factors earlier stated.\n\nWorsening scenario emerging in 10th Senate\n\nThe present 9th Senate going by realities on ground and particularly based on outcomes of primary elections conducted by the two major political parties i .e, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for senatorial candidates for the 109 Seats in the Senate; will have the least returnees in history.\n\nThis is so because as gathered from outcomes of such primaries elections alone, close to 60 Senators are out of the return bids for the next Senate in the 10th National Assembly.\n\nState by state analysis\n\nAnalytically on the basis of state by state assessments, in the North West, the entire three Senators from Jigawa state, namely Hadejia Hassan Ibrahim, Sankara Danladi Abubakar and Mohammed Sabo Nakudu are not coming back .\n\nThey all ran for the governorship tickets of their state from APC and lost to the current deputy governor, Alhaji Umar Namadi and invariably paved way for APC to pick new candidates for the three senatorial seats.\n\nAs it was in Jigawa, so it is in Katsina state where none of the three serving senators namely, Ahmed Baba Kaita, Bello Mandiya and Abdullahi Barkiya Kabir secured return ticket from their party (APC).\n\nFor Kaita, the quest for governorship position of the state, made him to quit the party few months ago to PDP while Mandiya and Barkiya lost out in the senatorial primary elections conducted by the party last Saturday.\n\nIn Zamfara state, within the same North West geo \u2013 political zone, out of the three senators who came into the 9th Senate in June 2019, only one has secured return ticket for contest in the 2023 general election for possible return into the coming 10th Senate.\n\nWhile Senator Sabi Ya\u2019u (Zamfara North) succeeded in getting return ticket, Senator Lawali Hassan Anka (Zamfara West) sacrificed his own for former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari who is being pacified by the state governor, Bello Mattawale, along with Senator Kabiru Marafa settled with Zamfara Central Senatorial ticket, a seat occupied by Senator Mohammed Hassan before resigning for deputy governorship position of the state few months back.\n\nIn Kebbi state, only Senator Bala Ibn Na \u2018Allah (Kebbi South) got a return ticket out of the three serving senators from the state. The Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North), lost out in the primary election conducted on Saturday while Senator Adamu Aliero (Kebbi Central), withdrew from the race and even quit the party on alleged manipulation of the entire process by the state governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu.\n\nIn Kaduna state, only Senator Suleiman Abdul \u2013 Kwari (Kaduna North) secured return ticket from his party (APC), as Senator Uba Sani (Kaduna Central) opted for the position of the state governor on the platform of APC while Senator Danjumah La\u2019ah (Kaduna South), lost out in the primary election conducted by his party (PDP).\n\nHowever, in Kano state, though Senator Ibrahim Shekarau (Kano Central) dumped APC for NNDP, he is sure to get ticket there while Senators Kabiru Gaya (Kano South) and Jibrin Barau (Kano North) secured returned tickets from APC.\n\nA similar scenario played out in Sokoto state among the three serving senators who all got return tickets. The senators are Aliyu Wammakko (Sokoto North), Gobir Ibrahim Abdullahi (Sokoto East) and Ibrahim Abdullahi (Sokoto South) who defected from PDP to APC few months ago.\n\nIn North Central geo \u2013 political zone, particularly, Plateau state , none of the three serving Senators namely Professor Nora Ladi Daduut (Plateau South) Dimka Hezekiah (Plateau Central) and Gyang Istifanus Dung (Plateau North), secured return ticket from their parties.\n\nIn Kogi state, Senators Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West) and Yakubu Oseni (Kogi Central) are not returning to the Senate with only Senator Jibrin Isa (Kogi East), securing returning ticket.\n\nAlso in Niger state, while fate of Senate Bima Enagi (Niger South) is not known yet, the Deputy Whip of the Senate, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (Niger North) lost out in his bid for a return ticket but Senator Sani Musa (Niger East) got a return ticket from the primary election conducted last Saturday .\n\nIn Nasarawa state, only Senator Tanko Al \u2013 Makura (Nasarawa South), seems to be coming back as Senator Adamu Abdullahi the APC National Chairman (Nasarawa West) resigned from the Senate while Senator Godiya Akwashiki (Nasarawa North), was still struggling to get return ticket as at the time of this report.\n\nHowever, in Benue and Kwara states respectively, two out of the three Senators from the states, secured returned tickets. Those that did not get return tickets were Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central) and Orker \u2013 Jev Emmanuel Yisa (Benue North West ).\n\nIn North East geo political zone starting with Bauchi state, all the three serving senators lost out.\n\nWhile Senator Haliru Jika (Bauchi Central) lost out indirectly by contesting the governorship primaries without success, the two other senators i.e, Lawal Gumau (Bauchi South) and Bulkachuwa Adamu Muhammad (Bauchi North), lost out in the Senatorial primaries conducted on Sunday.\n\nIn Taraba state, only Senator Isa Shuaibu Lau (Taraba North), secured return ticket while Senators Emmanuel Bwacha (Taraba South) and Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf (Taraba Central) went for governorship contest later won by Bwacha.\n\nIn Yobe state, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan is not coming back because of his Presidential ambition which made APC cede the ticket for Yobe North senatorial district to a new person on Saturday.\n\nBut the former governor of the state, Senator Ibrahim Gaidam (Yobe East), and Senator Bomai Ibrahim Mohammed (Yobe South), secured return tickets from APC .\n\nIn Gombe state, Senator Amos Bulus Kilawangs (Gombe South) lost out in his return bid to former Senator Joshua Lidani while Senators Mohammed Danjuma Goje ( Gombe Central ) and Alkali Saidu ( Gombe North ), secured return tickets from APC.\n\nSimilar scenario played out in Adamawa state, where Senators Ishaku Elisha Cliff Abbo (Adamawa North) and Binos Dauda Yaroe (Adamawa South), secured return tickets from APC and PDP respectively, while Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani (Adamawa Central), is rooting for the governorship position of the state, having emerged as the guber candidate of APC.\n\nTwo senators also secured return bids from Borno state as shown with the APC senatorial primary results which declared Senator Shettima Kashim (Borno Central) and Ali Ndume (Borno South) as winners while Senator Abubakar Kyari (Borno North), being the National Deputy Chairman of APC (North), did not seek for return.\n\nIn South West from Ondo state , similar trend of high turnover is reflected with none of the three serving Senators i.e., the Senate Deputy Leader, Ajayi Boroffice (Ondo North), Ayo Akinyelure ( Ondo Central) and Nicholas Tofowomo (Ondo South), returning.\n\nIn Lagos state, only Senator Tokunbo Abiru (Lagos East) is returning due to shifting of political base to Ogun West by Senator Olamilekan Adeola from Lagos West and voluntary stoppage of contest by Senator Oluremi Tinubu (Lagos Central).\n\nIn Ogun state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun Central), is not making a return due to his presidential ambition while Senator Lekan Mustapha (Ogun East) has secured return ticket . For Ogun West, Senators Olamilekan Adeola and Tolu Odebiyi are separately laying claim to the ticket.\n\nIn Oyo state, Senators Abdulfatah Buhari (Oyo North) and Lekan Mustapha (Oyo South), secured return tickets but Senator Teslim Folarin (Oyo Central), did not make a return bid due to Gubernatorial ambition.\n\nHowever, in Ekiti and Osun states , available results from primaries conducted by APC and PDP indicate that the six serving senators from the states, secured return tickets.\n\nIn South \u2013 South geo \u2013 political zone, only Senator Clifford Ordia (Edo Central) got return ticket out of the three serving senators from Edo state.\n\nIn Cross River state, similar scenario played out with Senators Sandy Onor (Cross River Central) and Gershom Bassey (Cross River South), not making return bids due to gubernatorial ambitions.\n\nSimilar trend played out in Delta State where the Deputy President of the Senate Ovie Omo \u2013 Agege (Delta Central) and James Manager (Delta South) are out of return bids due to Gubernatorial ambition leaving Senator Peter Nwaoboshi (Delta North) with return bid into the 10th Senate.\n\nOnly Senator Barinada Mpigi ( Rivers South East ), secured return ticket in Rivers State like Eyinkenyi Akon Etim from Akwa Ibom state.\n\nHowever, in Bayelsa state, the entire three serving Senators secured return tickets.\n\nIn South East geo political zone, only Senator Chukwuma Frank Ibezim from Imo North secured return ticket out of the three serving Senators from Imo state. Ezenwa Francis (Imo East) was defeated in primary while Rochas Okorocha (Imo West) opted for presidential race.\n\nHowever, while the fates of the three serving Senators from Ebonyi State are still hanging in the balance due to inconclusive primaries carried out across the three senatorial districts by PDP, two out of the serving senators from Abia, Anambra and Enugu states respectively, secured return tickets just as the only Senator for the Federal Capital Territory, Philip Tanimu Aduda, secured return ticket.\n\nAll in all, at the level of primary election alone, 58 out of 109 senators are out of the race for the 10th Senate in 2023, some of whom will not even make it at general election, clearly showing sign of tsunami as far as numbers of senators who will not return are concerned.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By our correspondent\n\nNew Materials Nigeria Company, a building material company recently commissioned in the Kuje area of Abuja will save Nigeria a whopping sum of $100m in foreign exchange annually when fully operational, its Managing Director, Mr. Jackie Dai Hui has said.\n\nBriefing newsmen on the advantages of establishing the company in Nigeria, Mr. Jackie said it is estimated that when the company which produces Fiber Cement Board reaches its peak of about five million square meters annually; it would help the federal government save $100m in foreign exchange.\n\nHe explained that if the New Materials Nigeria Company succeeds, it will, within 10 years, invest in more companies and product lines especially in the area of production of Gypsum and Solar panels for alternative power generation.\n\nSpeaking further, the Managing Director said that so far, over $50 million has been invested in the New Materials Nigeria Company explaining that in no distant time, it will grow its investment in Nigeria by establishing a branch in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the New Materials Nigeria Company has gone a long way to provide employment to 150 Nigerians both at senior and junior levels who he said are also being trained in various skills.\n\n\u201cWe have management and junior staff. Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future. Right now, we have up to 150 staff but less than 20 are Chinese, the others are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo for this factory, we are not only like a factory or company, we are also like a university. We sum it as a work chance or skill platform for local persons. We can train people. In a year, we can train a number of people that would contribute to the building of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe can increase our company\u2019s presence in Nigeria because we can source all our raw materials in Nigeria. And also we can make analysis for Nigeria building material markets. So, this product is new material but it has more advantages and so we have confidence. At the end of this year I am sure we will see good results.\n\n\u201cLet me add that the first person to come to Nigeria from our company didn\u2019t know what Fiber Cement Board was, but now we all know and we all love the product. I have confidence in Nigeria. As Eric, the Deputy Managing Director said, we want to work with universities to do some research about our product. We can share the platform for people to learn more in Universities and Polytechnics; we can share knowledge\u201d, Mr. Jackie added.\n\nOn Corporate Social Responsibility, he said the company has built roads for the host communities, built boreholes to help them have access to clean water; and rehabilitated some schools and roofing sheets for some of their buildings.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nIt is unlikely that President Muhammadu Buhari will impose a presidential candidate on the All Progressives Congress (APC), says Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State.\n\nGovernor Sule stated this on Tuesday during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, while giving an update on the meeting between members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum and the President.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a situation where the President would just say that \u2018this is the person (his preferred candidate), take him\u2019. I don\u2019t think it is going to be that.\n\n\u201cIf it is going to be that, then he won\u2019t be inviting people for consultation,\u201d the governor said ahead of the APC convention scheduled to commence next week Monday.\n\nThe ruling party officially began the search for its ideal flagbearer in the forthcoming presidential election on Monday by screening those who have indicated an interest in its ticket to contest the poll.\n\nA Sense Of Victory\n\nWhile the John Oyegun-led APC Presidential Screening Committee was conducting the exercise at a hotel in Abuja, President Buhari held a meeting with governors elected on the party\u2019s platform on how a candidate should emerge.\n\nIn his remarks during the meeting held at the State House, President Buhari charged the governors to ensure that the party\u2019s convention picks a presidential candidate that reflects all the values and virtues of the party.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the party will be holding its convention during which primaries would take place to pick the presidential flagbearer for the 2023 general elections,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his media adviser, Femi Adesina. \u201cThis is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens, and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of the candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari had assured the governors that the consultation process would continue, to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention.\n\nHe explained that the process was to also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors was effectively brought under control and that the APC emerges stronger.\n\nSearch For Right Candidate\n\nSpeaking with Channels Television, Governor Sule stressed that the President was clear on the qualities of who should emerge as the presidential candidate of the ruling party, but he never mentioned anyone.\n\nHe added that President Buhari recommended that such a person must be one who would be widely accepted by Nigerians in every part of the country, as well as understands the values of the APC.\n\n\u201cThe President clearly mentioned that \u2026 our consensus candidate or our candidate to be selected must be somebody (who is) acceptable to Nigerians; somebody who understands what the APC is all about and what the APC is after, and he mentioned clearly that it is somebody that will go to every part of the country and be accepted,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cSimilar to what President Muhammadu Buhari has said, we must bring somebody that can win an election and be able to sustain all the good things that the APC has done. So, that is exactly the definition of the President. But if you are looking for a name, the President didn\u2019t mention a name.\n\n\u201cSo, he gave us that in a plug and allowed us to think of the right person in these few days while he is in Spain. So, when he comes back, then everybody can say, \u2018okay, we have thought about it and we believe it is \u2026 who is going to be president.\u201d\n\nFight For Ticket\n\nWith just about five days to its primary, the APC has screened its presidential aspirants expected to participate in the exercise.\n\nIn no particular order, they include the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; and oil magnate, Tein Jack Rich.\n\nOthers are Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha popular Pastor Tunde Bakare, former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima, APC chieftain, Bola Tinubu; and former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nAlso screened were former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former presidential candidate, Nicholas Felix; a female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye; Ondo North Senator, Ajayi Boroffice; a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani; Governor David Umahi Ebonyi.\n\nThe rest include former Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, and former Minister of Information under the late General Sani Abacha regime, Ikeobasi Mokelu.\n\nA total of 28 aspirants picked the APC presidential nomination and expression of interest forms sold at N100 million, but the duo of former President Goodluck Jonathan and the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina, publicly rejected the forms purchased for them by interest groups.\n\nBesides the duo, the APC had also dropped the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; and Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, from aspirants to be screened by its panel.",

The truth remains that people will throw up everything and anything. I am not particularly accepting that the process was monetized excessively, safe for those that can be proven. If you are looking for Political parties that dollarises and criminalises the process, it\u2019s APC. Nobody should try to blackmail or take anything from our primary that is adjudged to be best.\u201d\n\nMr Sowunmi who also spoke on the allegation that emergency of Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the party is against the clamour for power shift to the South, said \u201cthe whole concept of zoning is a party affairs and must not be seen as constitutional. The country is divided into six zones and we must not just think it is three zones of the South against the north. The emergence of Atiku has not affected Nigeria\u2019s unity, rather the burden of unity lies with APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the strengthen of its candidate, Mr Sowunmi stated that Atiku Abubakar is a pan-Nigerian who will represent the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion.\n\nThe governorship candidate, however cautioned cultural groups like PANDEF, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere and others to steer clear of political matters and allow political parties manage its affairs. \u201d I have advised that PANDEF, Arewa, Afenifere and others need to be told not to jump into political matters as if they are political parties. They should not be seen usurping the powers of political parties.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party has the capacity to manage the fallout of the presidential primary, Mr Sowunmi noted that PDP will reach out to everybody and reconcile all groups, while nothing that there are no dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the party to present a candidate. If there is an equity challenge, nobody should address that to PDP rather the APC, because it has only produced its president from the northwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that politics is not for the lily-livered. What happened at the primary is that delegates voted for a unifier.\n\nOn zoning, Mr Sowunmi said \u201cI have maintained consistently that the place of birth is just an accident of history that no one can repair. The only equity challenge that we have is the Southeast because the region has not been able to produce president.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the political gladiators from the other side will always wish that only crises will exits from the camp of their rivals, but hello, you can go to the bank with this, the political process from \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will show that PDP is a big party. We\u2019ll hug ourselves and unite one another\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that your darling party is back, we have given you a darling candidate that you know well, Even with the congratulatory message from Asiwaju, it shows that he knows the worth of Atiku.

The jury deliberated for 13 hours over three days.\n\nDepp\u2019s lawyers countered that the actress had actually injured Depp after she \u201cthrew a vodka bottle at him that hit his hand and exploded, severing the end of one of his fingers.\u201d The actor flew back to Los Angeles for surgery on the hand following the incident.\n\nDepp\u2019s attorneys also zeroed in on the timing of Heard\u2019s sexual assault claim and said it was weaponized to bolster her defense in the case.\n\n\u201cMs. Heard had never made that accusation against Mr. Depp \u2014 it was never part of her allegations of abuse in 2016. So, what changed? When she realized the seriousness of what she alleged [about being the victim of domestic abuse], she panicked and alleged sexual assault,\u201d Depp\u2019s attorney Camille Vasquez told the jury. \u201cIn Mr. Depp\u2019s 58 years, not a single woman has ever accused him of violence.\u201d\n\nDuring his testimony, Depp was presented with evidence such as texts that painted a picture of a movie star who abused drugs and alcohol and was bent on revenge.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s begging for total global humiliation. She\u2019s gonna get it. \u2026 I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion or what I once thought was love for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy, pointless dangling overused flappy fish market,\u201d Depp wrote in a set of texts. \u201cI can only hope that karma kicks in and takes the gift of breath from her \u2026 Sorry man \u2026 But NOW I will stop at nothing!!! \u2026\u201c\n\nOn his final day on his stand, Depp described himself as a \u201cvictim, too, of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nAs for Heard, she testified about instances when she claimed Depp hit her, including one time when he allegedly slapped her across the face, and another where he \u201chead-butted me square in the nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would explode. He started doing things like destroying property and screaming at me,\u201d she testified. \u201cHe would grab me by the hair or he\u2019d grab me by the arm. \u2026. And it started. Slapping. And it got to the repetitive slaps where he\u2019d hold me in a position and slap like multiple times in a row.\u201d\n\nDuring her time on the stand, Heard also admitted to striking Depp multiple times in what she said was self-defense and in defense of her sister. Depp\u2019s former girlfriend Moss also took the stand in the trial, testifying that she was never assaulted by Depp during their four-year relationship in the \u201990s.\n\nThe Depp-Heard hearings have been at the center of public discussion for several weeks with fans making memes and posting threats on social media directed at Heard. During one of her last appearances on the stand, Heard said she had faced death threats from people online. \u201cI am harassed, humiliated, threatened every single day. Even just walking into this courtroom, sitting here in front of the world, having the worst parts of my life \u2014 things that I\u2019ve lived through \u2014 used to humiliate me. People want to kill me, and they tell me so every day,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to put my baby in the microwave, and they tell me that.\u201d\n\nThe trial also featured a strange subplot involving the ACLU and how it became deeply entwined with Heard and her former boyfriend, Elon Musk. In 2016, the actress announced that she would be donating her entire $7 million divorce settlement to the ACLU and Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles. Heard\u2019s credibility took a hit when Depp\u2019s lawyers presented evidence that she never made anywhere near the full donation and that she lied under oath about the matter in a separate U.K. trial involving the couple in 2020. The ACLU repeatedly stonewalled Depp\u2019s team in a move that raised eyebrows, and the nonprofit recently filed in a New York court to recoup $86,253.26 from Depp for its time and the cost of document preparation. A hearing on the matter has been set for June 15, 2022.\n\nDepp and Heard started dating in 2012, got engaged in 2014, and were married the following year. They separated in 2016 and finalized their divorce in 2017, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe following year, Heard wrote her Washington Post op-ed claiming to be a survivor of domestic abuse. Depp sued her for defamation in 2019 over the article.\n\nRollimg Stone",
