It is the first time I have actually seen an example of the kind of query that the media is getting,\u201d he said.\n\nReading a part of the letter the NBC sent to Channels TV, which says \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that its presenter shall handle with professionalism and sound judgement,\u201d Soyinka expressed dismay over the over-zealousness of officials of the NBC.\n\n\u201cProfessionalism and sound judgement? Who decides that? Is the National Broadcasting Commission the mass communication fora? Is it judging people\u2019s papers? Is it setting examinations? Who is the impartial arbiter? Who is the expert who decides things like that? This is one of the most outstanding semi-literate kind of official query,\u201d he lamented.\n\nWhile decrying the genocide that is currently taking place in some parts of the country, especially in Kaduna and Plateau, and the seeming ineptitude and helplessness of government over what he called the enslavement of young boys and girls and trading them for money in form of ransom, Soyinka said it constitute some of the parameters of a failed state.\n\nHe continued: \u201cAmong the actions that qualify as genocide are: One, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; two, deliberate inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction in whole or in part, and finally forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\n\u201cSo where are the Chibok girls? Where are the pupils of the Ahmadiyya School? Where are the pupils of the Bethel Baptist School? So what is happening? How do we describe the targeting of children.?\u201d\n\nSoyinka, therefore, called on the international community to intervene and stop the enslavement of children in form of kidnapping, abduction and trading of children to the highest bidder.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Medical bodies to give FG 21-day ultimatum\n\nForum of health institutions\u2019 chairmen seek end to NARD strike\n\nNgige: Striking doctors begrudge government\u2019s generosity, want to act above law\n\nThe three-week-old strike embarked upon by the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) assumed a new dimension on Saturday with threats by three other associations of medical doctors to join them if pending issues are not resolved before September 18.\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) and the Medical and Dental Doctors in Academics (MEDSABAM) unanimously agreed to join their counterparts in NARD if the Federal Government fails to resolve all the pending issues.\n\nThe threats coincided with calls by the Forum of Chairmen of Health Institutions in Nigeria (FCHIN) for quick resolution of the ongoing strike by resident doctors.\n\nAt a just concluded National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NMA, the various medical bodies agreed to send a letter to the Federal Government to register their displeasure and give it a 21-day ultimatum, which will lapse on September 18, 2021.\n\nThe NEC frowned at the instruction for immediate implementation of the \u201cNo Work, No Pay\u201d rule issued by the Federal Ministry of Health to the Chief Medical Directors and Medical Directors of Federal Tertiary Institutions.\n\nThe rule applies to all resident doctors and other medical professionals who have failed to report to work since August 2.\n\nIt will be recalled that MDCAN had on August 15 resolved to shelve its planned strike while it gave the Federal Government a four-week grace to reverse the removal of the Consultants from the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) to the Consolidated University Academic Salary Structure (CONUASS) by their employing universities.\n\nMEDSABAM had also given the federal government a four-week ultimatum to resolve its issues.\n\nSpeaking with The Nation correspondent in Abuja yesterday, the Chairman of Communication and Communique of the NARD, Dr Julian Ojebo, said: \u201cThe National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) held from Wednesday till the early hours of this morning (yesterday).\n\n\u201cThe crux of the matter was the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors\u2019 strike, and the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the NMA.\n\n\u201cThere is also the issue of the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) pending strike. MDCAN gave the government a four-week ultimatum to fulfill their demands.\n\n\u201cAlso, there was the issue of the Medical and Dental Doctors in Academics (MEDSABAM) pending strike. MEDSABAM also gave the government a four-week ultimatum.\n\n\u201cThese and many more issues were also discussed at the meeting.\n\n\u201cHowever, the highlight of the meeting was item number 6, which was the NARD strike.\n\n\u201cDiscussions on item number 6 lasted for seven hours where state chairmen and secretaries, alongside all the committee members, debated on the issues surrounding the NARD strike, and the need for the NMA to put forth a strongly worded letter to the government \u2013 the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Employment.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting, most members of the NEC were made aware of the implementation of the \u2018No Work No Pay\u2019 which is against the backdrop of the signatures of the memorandum of understanding, which goes to show that government has already reneged on the MoU they had with the NMA.\n\n\u201cAfter these, motions were moved and it was unanimously agreed that a 21-day ultimatum, which expires on the 18th of September, be given to the Federal Government, after which the Nigerian Medical Association will embark on a total indefinite strike.\n\n\u201cIf the government does not resolve all pending issues before those 21 days, the NMA will be left with nothing than to join the doctors \u2013 NARD, MDCAN, MEDSABAM, in a total indefinite strike.\n\n\u201cThe NMA NEC also frowned at the circular from the Office of the Head of Service removing house officers from the scheme of service and ordered that the NMA approaches the Head of Service for immediate withdrawal of that circular, and also place caution on the Ministry of Health and the Office of the Head of Service of Lagos State against adopting that heinous circular from the Head of Service of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was attended by 37 Chairmen and Secretaries of the various NMA plus the FCT, Committee Chairmen and Secretaries, President of Affiliates and other observers.\n\n\u201cAlso present were past presidents and secretaries and the President of the Commonwealth Medical Association, Dr Osahon Enabulele.\u201d\n\nForum of health institutions\u2019 chairmen seek end to NARD strike\n\nThe Forum of Chairmen of Health Institutions in Nigeria (FCHIN) yesterday called for quick resolution of the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors.\n\nThe body said the continued resort to strike by health workers disrupt services, adding that it does not portray the country in good light.\n\nThe forum said it would meet with the leadership of the Nigerian Medical Association and representatives of the Federal Ministry of Health to find solution to incessant strike in the health sector.\n\nThe chairman of the forum, Dr. Sam Jaja, who led the leadership of the forum to a meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige in Abuja, said the forum would choose a four-pronged approach to resolve the dispute.\n\nA statement issued by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, yesterday frowned at the frequent resort to strike by doctors.\n\n\u201cStrike should be the last resort when every other effort has been exhausted in terms of finding solution to whatever the problem is.\n\n\u201cBut for any little thing, you resort to disruption of services; it does not portray the country in good light.\n\n\u201cIt does not also portray the profession in good light, especially such a profession that has to do with the preservation of human lives.\n\n\u201cThe Committee of Chief Medical Directors (CMDS) briefed us and it is just exactly what you have narrated.\n\n\u201cAll hope was that the meeting of last week where all the affiliates of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) except NARD signed the MOU would resolve the strike.\n\n\u201cWe feel so concerned the strike hasn\u2019t been called off.\n\n\u201cIt makes them (doctors) insensitive, and that is not right. For whatever reason, I think we should nip it in the bud. That is what we as Forum of Chairmen of Health Institutions of Nigeria are in for.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a solution to this. It is not good for us and it is not good for them.\n\n\u201cI bet that as you are solving this problem, others are warming up to start theirs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow them to continue. We must find a permanent solution.\n\n\u201cAs the representatives of their employers, we can\u2019t continue to fold our hands over this constant disruption of health services in the country.\n\n\u201cOur plan was to meet first with the NMA, NARD and the Ministry of Health before coming to you.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, you are the first to open your doors to us. So, we came to intimate you with our plans. We will return when we round off meeting with them,\u201d the statement said.\n\nStriking doctors want to act above law \u2014 Ngige\n\nNgige faulted the ongoing strike, describing it as unjustifiable and unwarranted, even as he said the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with doctors on August 21 was on course.\n\nHe said government had adopted a holistic approach to tackling the challenges in the health sector, noting that some of the issues in contention cut across sectors.\n\nHe added that government bent backwards to improve the ease of practice of medicine in the country despite dwindling resources.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe resident doctors are on the scheme of service against which obtained earlier. There was nothing like that when we started practice.\n\n\u201cNigeria is also about the only country that has the Medical Residency Training Fund backed up by an act, Medical Residency Training Act, passed into law by this administration in 2018.\n\n\u201cN4.8 billion is already in 2021 Service Wide Vote for this \u2013 to cover exam fees, books, travel to exam centres and accommodation. We are battling to meet up the timeline on this.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the Residency Training Fund for 2021 is a borrowed fund. It is part of the deficit budget funded by the World Bank and IMF.\n\n\u201cNow that the President has signed the law governing it, with signatures appended, we can access this fund through the CBN and from there to the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget Office and to the Accountant General of the Federation.\n\n\u201cBut it is not what you achieve in a day. It takes some time. But these young doctors will hear none of that.\n\n\u201cTake the issue of hazard allowance. It was even the Federal Government who noticed the paltry sum doctors and health workers receive and said no during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic last year.\n\n\u201cConsidering the dangers they face, government took the bull by the horn, approved and released a jumbo, the sum of N32 billion as hazard allowance.\n\n\u201cWe felt this is commensurate with the dangers of the pandemic and immediately after, felt the need to re-negotiate and give them something more meaningful than the N5000 they were earning since 20 years and kept quiet.\n\n\u201cNow that we have invited them for re-negotiation, they turned round to make it an issue, claiming that the process is too slow.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, they are the ones causing the delay. NMA and JOHESU can\u2019t agree on the table.\n\n\u201cRight now, the two have written to me to say they won\u2019t negotiate together again.\n\n\u201cNMA said that they must compartmentalise into clinical and non-clinical, and that the people who are clinical should take more money.\n\n\u2018JOHESU said no, we don\u2019t want clinical and non-clinical. We have clinical and non-clinical people but the hazard is the same because we are working in the same hospital environment.\n\n\u201cSo, who do you blame for the delay? Government or doctors and JOHESU?\u201d\n\nNgige said all the issues contained in the MoU, ranging from arrears of the consequential adjustment of the national minimum wage to skipping allowance and bench fees, among others, have successfully been tackled at the meeting of 20 and 21 August, and all affiliates of the NMA signed the MOA with NARD dissenting.\n\nHe said: \u201cNARD wants a particular clause to be inserted in the agreement that section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act should not apply to them. That we should insert in it a government agreement that they should be paid for the period they are not at work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being careful about this. This is law and I will not lend myself to illegality to state in the agreement that a group of Nigerians are above the law. But as a matter of fact, a clause in that agreement states clearly that nobody should be punished for participating or not participating in the strike.\n\n\u201cSo, what else do they want? They want me to put it in writing that they are above the law. That \u2018No work No pay\u2019 should not apply to them. That \u2018No work, No pay\u2019 is no more part of our law, despite the fact that I swore to uphold the constitution?\n\n\u201cThis is notwithstanding that a clause in the agreement says that no one should be punished for any role in the strike. This is why they refused to sign the MOU and call off the strike, and not because government has not substantially met their demands.\u201d\n\nThe minister further urged the officials in the parent ministries of the unions in perennial strikes to sit up and effectively play their roles.\n\n\u201cWhether you are talking about ASUU, SSANU, NMA, JOHESU, etc., their employers are the federal ministries of education and health respectively.

          "title": "Of death and Captain \u2018Hosa\u2019s transfiguration",
          "text": "The transfiguration of my big brother, Captain Idahosa Wells Okunbo, in the morning of Sunday, August 8, 2021 was triumphalist. Having reconciled with his creator, the Lord Jesus Christ, in the twilight of his earthly voyage, transmogrifying on Sunday, a day set aside for His worship validates the significant reconciliation that explicates his victory over death.\n\nYes, Capt. \u2019Hosa did not die! He only experienced a transformation, from terrestrial to celestial being, in an eternal flight (for, he was a retired commercial jet pilot) that presaged his change of location to the \u201chereafter\u201d from the \u201cherebefore\u201d as exemplified by the late profoundly fecund Kenyan writer, Ali Al\u2019amin Mazrui in his fine and unusual piece of fiction: \u201cThe Trial of Christopher Okigbo.\u201d\n\nPermit this encore: Capt. \u2018Hosa did not die! In the morning of August 8, 2021, in faraway London, where he had been since September last year, receiving treatment after his doctors had diagnosed him with pancreatic and liver cancer, Capt. \u2018Hosa (aka Cappi) only laughed death to scorn in transcendence, knowing full well that he lives in hearts.\n\nTo be sure, Cappi lives in my heart and in the hearts of so many others to whom he was a benefactor; and, as Thomas Campbell once said: \u201cTo live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.\u201d Consider Hazel Gaynor\u2019s modification and compelling reinforcement of the same eternal lines: \u201cTo live in the hearts of those we love is never to die.\u201d If Gaynor\u2019s is compellingly reinforcing, that of Ann Evans, the English novelist known by her \u201cpet name\u201d- George Elliot- to wit: \u201cOur dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them\u201d, remains instructively true.\n\nHow could Cappi have died when he lives in my heart and the hearts of others too numerous to aggregate in a trivializing summative enterprise? How could anyone, for that matter and for whatever reason, forget Cappi in their life and times with the magnitude of affection and compassion that he showed to the significant others while here?\n\nCappi was Godsend. He was a guardian Angel who ministered to the needs of thousands of souls. I am a beneficiary of Cappi\u2019s large-heartedness. His eleemosynary acts were incredibly writ-large; yet he was shy about public recognition and/or appreciation of the same. He gave to others liberally. In fact, he was always looking out for opportunities to give, to minister to other people\u2019s needs in very substantial ways.\n\nSignificantly, by his act of restless giving, Cappi inadvertently responded to the philosophical summons of Ziad K. Abdelnour: \u201cNever measure your life by possessions. Measure it by the hearts you touched, the smiles you created, and the love you shared.\u201d On several occasions, in the course of our conversations, Cappi would always thank God for over blessing him such that money no longer meant anything to him but what meant so much to him was the philosophy of value creation and addition in many of his difficult-terrain businesses, a rare philosophy that was largely undergirded by the virtue of integrity.\n\nCappi was a man of integrity. His words were his bonds. All through our interactions from 2012 up till the time he was transfigured, the integrity component of his character was never compromised. Whereas, he got to know me tangentially through my brother, Hon. Ehiozuwa Johnson Agbonayinma, it was while I was tending to the media affairs of the late Chief Tony Anenih that both of us hit it off. He would always call on me to assist him with some media interventions in support of others, not even himself. I never disappointed him all through; and he was very appreciative of my little efforts each time I was privileged to undertake some media assignments for him.\n\nAnywhere, and everywhere he had the opportunity of introducing me to his friends, he always introduced me as Chief Anenih\u2019s son. He would occasionally add: \u201cMy brother Ojeifo is a brilliant journalist and writer.\u201d I thank Cappi for the monumental confidence he reposed in me. I thank him for the compassion. I thank him for the brotherliness he extended to me to the end. Even from his hospital bed in London, he was still showing love to me even without asking. Anytime I received the familiar message: \u201cMy brother Ojeifo, text your account details to me\u201d, I knew I was up for some positive embarrassments. Cappi always did it in seven digits.\n\nIn July 2019, he gave me a carte blanche via a lengthy WhatsApp message that he sent to me after he heard that I had some issues which I had attended to by myself without letting him know. He expressed his displeasure that I did not get in touch. He, therein, told me that I should thenceforth not hesitate to ask him for financial support if I was under pressure and needed assistance. He said he would always be there to take the pressure off me. Even though, I did not take advantage of that free rein, he decided to deploy his discretion in blessing me financially in episodic flourish.\n\nCappi lived out the words of the French historian and philosopher, Voltaire, who once said: \u201cGod gave us the gift of life; it is up to us to give ourselves the gift of living well.\u201d He did not only give himself the gift of living well, he also gave the same to others through his kindness and generosity. Regardless of the bodily affliction that eventually led him to his earthly terminus, the Almighty God loves him endlessly. I love Cappi with the love of God. When on October 5, 2020, he sent me text message to intimate me with the diagnosis by his medics in London and asked that I should be praying for him, I activated so many prayer channels in addition to daily encouraging him with scriptural verses on healing.\n\nIt was gladdening that before long, he embraced his creator and was now the one bombarding me with scriptural verses in uplift of God, messages, praise and worship songs, etc. My daily silent cries turned into happiness because Cappi took the significant opportunity to reconcile with Christ.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, Cappi had put a call through to me to put together a statement on his health condition, which some persons had orchestrated to look as if it was as a result of the outcome of the September 19, 2020 Edo governorship poll in which he publicly supported Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.\n\nRead some parts of the statement, which was well received by the publics in Edo State: \u201c\u2026It is evidently ungodly for people to gloat over the fact that I am not feeling well. God does not approve of such disposition and those who engage in that pastime are only mocking and playing God.\n\n\u201cI have never claimed to be a super human being. I do not deny the fact that I am not well. I am outside the country for my medicals, which were delayed because of the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cAfter a series of tests, my doctors confirmed that I have some health issues. It is, therefore, ill-advised and inhuman for those who are not comfortable with the position I took in the Edo election to joyfully circulate in the social media that I have health issues and I have slid into coma. Well, I leave them all to God.\n\n\u201cI am over 60 years. I thank God who gave me the gift of life, an opportunity to live a good life, the grace to build a legacy of achievements and, most importantly, a good name, which is better thank silver and gold.\n\n\u201cI hold dearly to heart the words of the scriptures that there is a time to be born; and a time to die. But what is most important in life is what I have done with my life. And, this applies to every mortal being\u2026.\u201d\n\nCappi had already demonstrated his readiness to laugh death to scorn. Despite the grim prognosis and the imminence of his transfiguration, I was still devastated and greatly diminished by the news of it, a la John Donne in \u201cMeditation 17\u201d, one of a series of essays he wrote when he was seriously ill in the winter of 1623, and which has since been popularly remembered for one excerpt: \u201cAny man\u2019s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\u201d\n\nJohn Donne was apt. H.L. Dietrich expanded the frontiers of that proposition in a somewhat solemn fashion, when he said: \u201cWe are all victims\u2026Our destinies are decided by a cosmic roll of the dice, the winds of the stars, the vagrant breezes of fortune that blow from the windmills of the gods.\u201d\n\nFor my dear big brother, Cappi, it is as another big brother of mine, Senator Ehigie Uzamere, said in a poem: \u201cit was sunset at noon.\u201d Cappi\u2019s transfiguration is a monumental tragedy; it is our collective loss; it is our communal pain. But instead of mourning, we should celebrate his beautiful life and times, yes, the magnitude of the positive impact with which he defined his eon.\n\nThe words of Cicero resonate for the comfort of those of us who celebrate Cappi on his eternal flight: \u201cA thousand words won\u2019t bring you back, I know because I\u2019ve tried; neither will a thousand tears; I know because I\u2019ve cried. Each happiness of yesterday is a memory for tomorrow. Always on my mind; forever in my heart. The life of the dead is placed in the heart of the living.\u201d\n\nI am also consensus ad idem with the words of an anonymous writer, to wit: \u201cTreasured in my heart you\u2019ll stay, until we meet again someday. Forever in this heart of mine, an everlasting bond, for now until the end of time, are memories so fond. Those we love don\u2019t go away; they walk beside us every day. Unseen, unheard, but always near; still loved, still missed and very dear.\u201d\n\nAs the family of Capt. \u2018Hosa plans the interment of his body, a poem; \u201cDo not stand at my grave and weep\u201d by an American author and poet, Mary Frye, echoes in its distinctive cadence: \u201cDo not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep. I am in a thousand winds that blow, I am the softly falling snow. I am the gentle showers of rain; I am the fields of ripening grain. I am in the morning hush; I am in the graceful rush. Of beautiful birds in circling flight; I am a star shining in the night. I am in the flowers that bloom; I am in a quiet room. I am in the birds that sing; I am in each lovely thing. Do not stand at my grave and cry; I am not there. I did not die!\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCapt. \u2018Hosa did not die! He was only transfigured. But as Mark Anthony said in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d, \u201cHere was a Caesar, when comes such another?\u201d, permit this extrapolation, herein: \u201cHere was a Capt. \u2018Hosa; when comes another?\u201d I thank Cappi for his beautiful life and times, for his dedicated service to God and for the kindness he showed to humanity.\n\nInimitable Cappi, rest peacefully in the Bosom of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Good night my big brother till we meet again on the Resurrection morning. Maximum respects!",

          "title": "Zulum: Borno in \u2018Catch-22 situation\u2019 over Boko Haram\u2019s surrender",
          "text": "With the latest offensive on Boko Haram insurgents and bandits in Borno and it\u2019s environ from its earlier defensive position, the Nigerian military hot chase iS yielding dividends.\n\nSome of the insurgents are giving up their arms and surrendering themselves.\n\nThis is a news that has however thrown up another challenge that must be cautiously and passionately addressed by all stakeholders, if the desired peace must be ultimately achieved.\n\nThe gradual surrendering of the insurgents has raised questions which are thought provoking. What prompted the sudden upsurge in the surrender episode? Is it out of hunger or out of conviction that after all, the whole exercise (insurgency) does not worth it in the first instance? Is it as a result of the onslaught mounted on the insurgents by the military, prompting the surrender as the best option rather to be defeated and treated as prisoners of war? Should the repentant be prosecuted or not? Will the repentants be readily accepted in their hitherto communities where some of the insurgents have debased, abused or spilled blood, deaths and sorrow? If not where will they go? Any assurance that if pardoned, rehabilitated and resettled, some of them will not go back to the trenches or bush again having tested blood? Will the offended communities and the victims of the insurgents allow to let go, forgive and forget? For the orphans in particular, who takes full responsibility of them to matured stage? What of the widowers who lost all? What of the widows who lost their children, husbands and the rest?\n\nIf some of the repentant insurgents are rejected rightly or wrongly by the people for one reason or the other, will they not go back to the bush again to join other terrorists or insurgents? If this happen, are we not heading for endless terror war? Then where do we go from here?\n\nThese are questions that are trending, pricking, provoking and prodding demanding answers.\n\nAnd before the shout of Jack Robinson and prompted by the emerging trend, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno state, the epi-center of the insurgency and the lion\u2019s share bearer of the holocaust of Boko Haram bared his mind.\n\nIn the address: \u201cBorno is in \u201cCATCH-22 OVER BOKO HARAM\u2019S SURRENDER,\u201d Governor Zulum stated that Boko Haram fighters had left Borno in two extreme difficult situations in the ongoing surrender of some of its members.\n\nThe Governor who addressed the military and community leaders at separate locations in the same matter pointed out that the situation require diverse stakeholders including representatives of the attacked communities, to come together and critically review the pros and cons and implications of the surrender, in order to agree on a framework that in well thought out.\n\nWhile Zulum addressed the military commanders at the Brigades in Gwoza and Bama respectively, he equally passed the same message to community leaders at the palaces of the Emir of Gwoza and the Shehu of Bama respectively.\n\nThe address is profound in thought, soul searching and raised fundamental issues from thorough examination and discourse. Since the address in question is the basis that informed this article, it is hereby reproduced for emphasis and point of reference in the ongoing discourse or discussion on where and how to accommodate the repentant insurgents.\n\n\u201c\u201dWe (in Borno) are in a very difficult situation over the ongoing surrender by insurgents. We have to critically look between two extreme conditions and decide our future. We have to choose between an endless wars or to cautiously accept the surrendered terrorists which is really painful and difficult for anyone that has lost loved ones, difficult for all of us and even for the military whose colleagues have died and for volunteers. No one would find it easy to accept killers of his or her parents, children and other loved ones. In the last 12 years we have been in this war, and we have lost thousands of fellow citizens. We don\u2019t know the where-about of thousands of others, we don\u2019t know whether they are alive or dead. In these 12 years, millions have been made homeless and many wealthy farmers, transporters and others have been rendered poor. In these years, we were able to cultivate maybe around 3% of the arable land, and as a result our people became dependent on food aid amid donor fatigue and potential food insecurity, infact the repercussions of the Boko Haram crisis are enormous and as someone who has been involved with assessment of the impacts and rebuilding efforts in the last seven years, I am in position to know the endless negative impact the Boko Haram has made in Borno\u201d Zulum said.\n\nThe Governor pointed out accepting Boko Haram has the risk of seriously offending the feelings of victims with potential of civil rebellion, just as there is the risk that if Boko Haram fighters willing to surrender are rejected, they can join ISWAP to swell the ranks of fighters in the bush and the path of peace becomes narrowed.\n\nZulum went on \u201cOn my way travelling to Gwoza and Bama, I saw many people cultivating their farmlands by the roadside and this is an indication of emerging peace, which we have to sustain in order to salvage our people. However, like I said, we must come together to carefully analyze the two extremes and come up with a workable framework.\u201d\n\nHe explained, that he would engage in high level consultations with President Muhammadu Buhari, Service Chiefs and resident security heads, traditional rulers, elders and religious leaders, National and State Assembly members, academics and other stakeholders particularly victims of the crimes perpetrated by the insurgents, so that stakeholders will critically review the situation and come up with a framework on how to move forward.\n\nReacting to Zulum\u2019s address in its Editorial of Friday, August, 20, 2021, The Nation Newspaper pointed out that the surrendered Boko Haram cadres must face justice. Parts of the Editorial read, \u201cNo one,\u201d Prof. Zulum insisted, \u201cWould find it easy to accept killers of his or her parents, children and other loved ones.\u201d True.\n\n\u201cWhich is why there should really be no quandary, as to the fate the surrendering fighters should face justice. That is the only way to atone for their past crimes: against defenseless civilian victims; raped and captured women and children; and gallant officers and men of the Nigerian Armed Forces, that lost lives and limbs, in spirited defense of motherland.\n\n\u201cOpen, clear and transparent justice will also bring closure to the victims, heal the land of terrorist blights, teach the futility of dangerous Islamist radicalization and nurture sustainable peace, in lieu of destructive war, that has laid the area prostate for the past 12 years.\n\n\u201cThis much has been vouched by the Audu Ogbeh-chaired Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), which just forcefully argued the surrendered terrorists must face justice. Pooh-poohing any talk of amnesty for insurgents, ACF argued any talk of such would destroy the basis for trying other ethnic agitator\u2019s nation-wide, for breaching the peace.\n\n\u201cNo one can question Governor Zulum\u2019s bona fides, on the destruction Boko Haram wrought in Borno. He has offered leadership far beyond the call of duty, throwing himself in harm\u2019s way so many times, to show solidarity and empathy with his beleaguered people.\n\n\u201cHe has also encouraged and rewarded locals that have shown unusual courage in the face of the Boko Haram pestilence; and even called on the Federal Government to hire mercenaries to smoke out the insurgents and return peace to his state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat is why his mid-way plea must not be completely discarded, for short-term cessation of hostilities; and long-term sustainable peace.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s be clear again: there should be no talk of amnesty. Every surrendered insurrectionist must face justice. Still, the penalty regime must carefully differentiate between the mere foot soldiers (many of whom may have been suborned to the crime) and the grandmasters, who really are the evil brains behind the wanton terror.\n\n\u201cWhatever is decided, it should be clear to the surrendered, and the those thinking about surrendering, that they are better off, even while serving due punishment, than under the destructive Islamists in the bush.\u201d\n\nSimilarly in his response, the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan called for a national policy that would address issues regarding the status of the repentant insurgents in relation to the larger society. The Senate President among others is of the view that the affected repentant should each be treated strictly to the degree of his or her involvement.\n\nThe debate continues on this crucial matter whose treatment demands among others, cautious pragmatism, cunning skill, openness of mind, honesty and determination. It is an issue that should be all embracing in efforts and participation of all the stakeholders. The issue involves the stake of the nation and as such sentiments, emotion and travails should have no consideration in the final outcome of how to treat our misguided brothers who erroneously, rightly or wrongly chose to take up arms against their fatherland.\n\nAs we apply the law and seek solution to this delicate issue we should equally seek the face of God for fruitful outcome.",

          "title": "Men run after me because of my plus-size \u2013 Mary John, actress",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nBeautiful plus-size actress-cum-social media influencer, Mary John, has opened up on her sojourn in Nollywood, her love life, unique selling points and other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nHow would you describe yourself and personality?\n\nI am a strong and determined woman. I also see myself as a go-getter. Mary is fun-loving and easy going lady.\n\nHow long have you been acting and how has it been?\n\nI\u2019ve been acting professionally for six years now, but I have been on and off. This is because of my other activities and businesses. To be honest, in 2018, I became pregnant so I had to stop filming for two years.\n\nHow\u2019s the baby doing?\n\nHe is doing very well. Thanks. He clocked three a few months ago.\n\nSo, how has it been generally? What are some of the challenges you\u2019ve been facing in the industry?\n\nComing to the industry isn\u2019t easy at all; you have to put in some extra work. To me, I am not all about the everyday movies. If I have two good movies a month that\u2019s okay for me. However, I am okay and doing fine. There is no challenge that I can\u2019t handle.\n\nYou took a break to have your baby, when you returned did you feel you missed out on some things?\n\nYes, I felt it, but seeing my baby\u2019s smiles, I felt he is also worth the break. My baby\u2019s smiles worth everything and more\u2026\n\nHow does your husband react seeing you play romantic roles in movies?\n\nPlease skip this. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nAs a plus size TV star, what are the issues you encounter on and off set?\n\nFor the kind of body I have, men were all over me. But due to my determination and drive, I didn\u2019t give them the opportunity. I knew what I wanted, so I just waived off all the temptations that came my way. Many were coming for the body not because they were in love with me, but as an experienced woman, I know what I wanted and I stood my ground.\n\nHave you had any embarrassing encounter lately?\n\nAh! A lot, but the recent one was this fateful day that I was walking on the road and people started taking pictures of my butt, shouting that it was too big. It was funny and embarrassing at the same time, but we move on.\n\nWhat were your parents\u2019 reactions when you opted to join Nollywood?\n\nAt first, my dad wasn\u2019t in support, but when my movies began to show on Africa Magic he became a fan.\n\nWhat are the main difficulties people of plus size encounter?\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else because people face their own challenges. For me, none because I carry myself with so much pride. I\u2019m me and I will never want to be anyone else.\n\nIf given a chance, would you like to go under the knife for your body?\n\nYes oh. Just to remove belly fat, no additions to or subtractions from any other part of my body.\n\nLooking back, what are your regrets?\n\nThe only regret is that I got involved in a business that almost got me into depression.\n\nCan you mention titles of movies you\u2019ve done recently?\n\nAdaku is out, Perfect Game is a series and it\u2019s coming out soon. Perfect Marriage is coming out soon too. It was nominated for BON Awards. My other jobs aren\u2019t out yet.\n\nWhat would you say is your unique selling point?\n\nMy eyes, but most people will say \u2018Mary is a liar, it is her bumbum. However, I\u2019ll always choose my eyes and voice any time.\n\nWhat turns you on or off in relationship?\n\nMy turn on will be a responsible, caring, God-fearing man, who allows his woman to be herself at all times. A man who understands the word \u2018respect\u2019. My turn off will be an uptight man who thinks he owns the world. A man who does not understand that a woman too can be busy. Some men are so insecure that when she doesn\u2019t take his calls, she feels she\u2019s with another man. That is a big turn off for me.\n\nWhat kind of movie would you reject even if the pay is enticing?\n\nTo go completely nude is a no, no for me.\n\nBut you can play romantic roles?\n\nYes, but it shouldn\u2019t be too deep.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nWill Smith. I love him. But in Nollywood, it\u2019s Jim Iyke, I so much love that guy. His gangster game should be studied in Harvard.\n\nWho are those stars you\u2019re looking forward to act alongside?\n\nIn Nollywood, Funke Akindele because she\u2019s a strong woman with a funny character. She is a wife, producer, director and a business mogul. I respect her so much. Also, Mercy Johnson and Genevieve Nnaji. And for mothers, I like and respect Joke Sylvia and Ebelle Okaro because they are really strong women.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do?\n\nI am a plus size model, an interior decorator and social media influencer. I am also into real estate, and always open to business collaborations.\n\nCan you tell us briefly about your educational background?\n\nMy educational story is very deep. My mates wrote JAMB once, but mine was four times. Well, it\u2019s not because I was not brilliant, but I didn\u2019t know the forces behind me not passing. However, the last time I wrote JAMB, I got admission into a private polytechnic and I studied Performing and Media Art. That was how I started my career as an actor.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "title": "PDP governors joining APC signal we\u2019ll retain power in 2023 \u2013 Senator Osita Izunaso",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nArmed as an English graduate, a journalist, politician and now a lawyer, Senator Osita Izunaso, has no doubt become an indispensable asset of sort in the country.\n\nAfter his Call to Bar recently, he spoke to Sunday Sun on various range of issues including his motivation to return to school to study Law at old age, the contentious APC zoning arrangement ahead of the 2023 presidential election, the crisis rocking the APC in both national and his state, Imo, and the possibility of the APC retaining power beyond President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHaving equipped yourself in areas of journalism, politics and now law, what is next for you?\n\nI will remain in politics, but will not go far away from law. The only thing I may probably not do again is journalism. Once the court resumes from vacation, I will start going to court. I am going to attach myself with one of the most serious chambers in town to go through the practical legal tutelage before setting up my own chambers and employing lawyers to work with me.\n\nGoing by the enviable records you have built in politics, would you say that this is the APC of your dream?\n\nYou know that the party came to be as a merger and amalgamation of three, four or five entities. While three came in full, two others came half. The party struggled to gain power. Yes, we are still in power, but you don\u2019t expect us to get everything right. Don\u2019t forget that even the PDP that ruled for 16 years did not get everything right. What the APC is doing now is still a learning process of a learning party. We are still putting our acts together and putting things right. We might make some mistakes, but the truth of the matter is that whenever there is a problem in the APC, such problems never scatter the party. APC is doing well, but there is still room for correction of what we have not done well.\n\nWhich regime created more problems for APC between Oyegun not returning or Oshiomhole\u2019s removal?\n\nYou know that I was directly involved and would not want to comment on this so that people will not misinterpret me. However, everybody knows that when Oyegun was chairman, there was some level of proper party administration and cohesion. He does not go to NWC meetings with a mindset and believes that his thoughts will prevail. That is not correct. Under Oyegun, the meeting decides what happens. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to dabble into those areas. The good thing is that our party is on the right track and footing again. The congresses are conducted which will end with a national convention. The convention will guarantee the final stability of the APC.\n\nWhat are your fears against APC coasting home in the 2023 elections?\n\nWhy should I entertain any fear when the governors of the PDP are joining us, the APC, on their own? Even the blinds could see that the APC is growing bigger than what it was previously. Yes, I admit that the party grew high at one point and shaded weight; however, it is getting fatter again. The indication of the growth is that APC is getting fatter towards the election, which means that the party will certainly coast to victory in the 2023 general elections. Let me emphasize it that even if there are crises after the convention, it will still be sorted out well enough before we go into the primaries that will produce the candidate of our party for the 2023 elections.\n\nDid you take into consideration the fact that President Buhari will not contest the election in expressing confidence for APC victory?\n\nIf President Buhari is not contesting, does it mean that he will not have interest in what is going on in the party? An Igbo adage says that traditional rulers should not put hands in politics did not say that they should also remove their eyes. President Buhari will remain a major factor in deciding who the party\u2019s presidential candidate will be in 2023 whether he is contesting or not.\n\nWhat is your take on Igbo presidency in 2023?\n\nThat matter will be settled very soon. The party has not zoned any position to any place. There is going to be a zoning committee to decide which zone gets what. Party members will understand what is expected of them. But, you should know that APC will start zoning with the party\u2019s leadership positions. It is after this first zoning that we decide on the elective zoning arrangements. There is no need for anybody to get worried about the zoning arrangements for the 2023 presidential ticket. I am sure that APC must do what is fair and right. We should not start putting the cart before the horse. We are almost there and there is no need for this hurry and anxiety over zoning.\n\nHave you also heard the speculations that Southeast has no competent person to give the party\u2019s ticket?\n\nHow can anybody say such a thing? It is not true because there is no zone in this country that does not have thousands of competent hands to rule this country. People should dismiss with the wave of the hand the speculation that the Southeast has no competent person to produce a president.\n\nDid your attending Imo APC stakeholders\u2019 meeting confirm that there is peace in the party\u2019s state chapter?\n\nOf course, there has always been peace in the APC in Imo State. The governor is in charge. So, what is wrong in attending the meeting as major stakeholders of Imo State? On the contrary, if I didn\u2019t attend, it would be a confirmation that I am not politically relevant in the state. For your information, some of the people that did not attend were actually invited, but could not make it due to one engagement or the other. I don\u2019t think there is any debate over the peace in the APC fold in Imo State. Yes, there are people who may not agree with one another, but that does not mean that the party is not peaceful in the state. In Nigeria today, there are people who don\u2019t agree with President Buhari, but does that dispute the fact that he is the president of this country? Even if there is disagreement, there must always be a forum for reconciliation.\n\nWhy has it become difficult for Imo APC stakeholders to reconcile the governor and Okorocha?\n\nIt is wrong to say that the governor and Okorocha are fighting each other. It is a misinterpretation of what is going on in the Imo APC. There is no basis for any fighting because one is the governor while the other is the past governor. The party is big enough to accommodate everybody. During registration, everybody was told to register and how is it anybody\u2019s fault if someone chose not to register. I don\u2019t think that there is any quarrel, so to say, between the governor and the past governor. The question necessary now is what Imo people want at this point. Is the governor doing what Imo people want or not and if he is not, then it means that he is not doing well. It is not a personality thing and we must know that no singular person is above the state. A governor will come and go, but the state remains. The most popular person to govern Imo State is no longer alive, yet people still talk about him. His legacy is speaking for him and every governor must try to leave a legacy for people to remember him when he is no longer here.\n\nAs a member of the Campaign Committee for Anambra governorship election, are you comfortable with the aftermath of the state party primaries?\n\nAPC has bright chances to win the Anambra governorship election. I did not play an active role in the primary, but I can tell you that some people are not happy with the way the primary went. However, what is certain is that there is always room for reconciliation. Therefore, the first assignment for the Campaign Committee will be to reconcile the aggrieved persons. We have to do that even before we start election strategy and planning. We must have to listen to the aggrieved persons and even create a reconciliatory sub-committee to ensure they were not shutout.\n\nWhat advice do you have for those behind the spate of insecurity in the Southeast?\n\nI am happy that peace is gradually returning in the Southeast especially in Imo State. There are great improvements from what it used to be three months ago. Some people are beginning to reason better. Even in war situations, people still engage in dialogue. What we actually need most in the zone right now is peace. Even in protesting against those things we felt were denied us, we need a peaceful atmosphere to make our agitations known. Only recently, we saw the traditional rulers pouring libation on the ground in Imo, urging our sons and daughters to calm down and embrace peace. Nobody is saying that people should not air their minds, but we must give peace a chance. What is happening is not what anybody should encourage and no Igbo culture encourages anybody taking another person\u2019s life. It should be detested because killing is an abomination in Igbo land. In Igbo land, no matter how you struggle for anything with anybody, it is not possible to allow it to degenerate to the level of killing someone.\n\nWhat motivated you to return to school to study law at an old age?\n\nReading law was an ambition I nursed even when I was a young person. After getting my A-Level, my ambition was to go back to school and read Law. But I was given English instead of the course I desired when I gained admission in the University of Jos. I thought I would switch over after the first year, but because it was a direct entry for three years, it became very difficult to change the course. When I graduated, I left the ambition to read Law for a while and ventured into journalism after a Post Graduate Diploma in Journalism. I practiced journalism until I ventured into politics which is also very time-consuming. Despite all these, the desire to return to school to study law still persisted. I actually did by gaining admission to Nile University to read the course. However, after graduation, I faced the challenge of going to Law School because it is time consuming and stressful. The lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic struck three months after my commencement of the programme, but they continued online until we finished all the course work. The satisfaction is that I was eventually called to the Bar after everything. It is the satisfaction of a long-time ambition. I like my tenacity, resilience, perseverance and doggedness to continue with the programme because it is something that any small thing would have disrupted. I even lost some opportunities because reading law prevented me from getting one government appointment or the other. I resolved that good things can always come because once you are appointed into any executive position; you have to withdraw from Law School.\n\nFrom journalism to politics and now law, where do you think you can fit in most?\n\nOn the contrary, we should look at it from the point of versatility. However, I can tell you that journalism properly prepared and propelled me into venturing into politics. As a journalist, you read a lot; meet many people, and you are a custodian of the past and the present. Journalism brought me close to the political class and was a very fantastic foundation and launchpad for me to venture into politics. I have worked in both chambers of the House of Representatives and Senate as a staff. I have also been a member of both chambers as a legislator. All these are courtesy of my background as a journalist. As a politician, I noticed that politics is an interesting game. I am already deep into politics and I am not quitting it for now. I love the intrigues in politics. It is a game with lots of interests Law, as I said earlier, is something I have always dreamt of. Now that I have done it, I will still practice the profession and my satisfaction is to practice what I have learnt and the profession I believe was my first calling. I am full of expectation of how far I can fit into it. Even when I relate with people, they keep asking me if I am a lawyer. Others even called me an apprentice lawyer while we were in the APC NWC. I don\u2019t attend NWC meetings without arming myself with both the party and Nigeria constitution. I even go deeper to read the other party\u2019s constitution which helped me to speak with authority on most legal issues. I almost dropped out in my second and third year because the pressure of work was getting too much, but my happiness is that I persevered especially when I was rigged out of my victory during the last APC National Convention. I saw it as divine directive to help me complete the studies.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "title": "Reasons we formed Pentecostal Ministers Forum \u2013Bishop Jerry Anthony",
          "text": "By Gilbert Ekezie\n\nPresiding Bishop and General Overseer of King in Christ Power Ministries, Bishop Dr Jerry Chidi Anthony, has said that the only way to save Nigeria from disintegration is to dialogue with the secession agitators. The President of Pentecostal Ministers Forum (PMF) expressed concern over the level of decay in Nigeria and called on Church leaders to unite to save the country from collapse. He also spoke on other issues.\n\nAs a pentecostal bishop, it is expected that you should belong to the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), why then did you form PMF that looks like a parallel group?\n\nWell, as you have rightly said, I belong to PFN and CAN. PMF is not a parallel group. We decided to form it in order to help Churches in Nigeria because the PFN and CAN, which we expected to be of help to us, are not living up to our expectations . They do not carry the member Churches along. Could you believe that if any member has challenges, they will abandon the person to suffer alone. So, we resolved to form PMF to help ourselves, since CAN and PFN cannot help us. They are nothing but pressure groups which cannot affect the lives of individual ministers. That is why if you look at the set up and organisation of PFN, it is to get patronage from the government, but PMF is different.\n\nAre you saying that the leadership of PFN and CAN have compromised?\n\nYes, of course. There were cases where pastors had problems and PFN and CAN did not intervene. In fact, the so-called Fathers of faith have failed us. If any member is doing something and invite them, they will not come, unless you hold position or your Church is big. They will want to know the strength of your church, tell you to pay their flight tickets to and fro, get an expensive accomodation for them and their entourage, including feeding. So, after looking at all these, you find out that there is no need to invite them, especially if your church is not rich enough to reach their demands. All they are interested in is on the monthly dues we pay. But in PMF, it is compulsory that members should honour every invitation, and we use what we have to get what we want. It is unfortunate that they did not tell us the truth. They are the cause of what the church is going through today in Nigeria.\n\nHow are the faith fathers the cause of what the church is going through in Nigeria?\n\nYou could look at them having three private jets. Do they think those jets will prevent rapture from taking place? They build schools and children of pastors and the less privileged cannot go there due high rate of fees, yet they claim to be born again. It is so bad that if you do not belong to their cartel, you are not of God. In fact, it is frustrating and unfortunate that the church is fighting itselt. Have you ever seen Imams fighting themselves on the pages of newspapers? Look at one of the pastors who played music for many years , but could not find his destiny, calling the late T. B. Joshua who lived like Christ, a wizard. He is even marrying people\u2019s wives and doing all sorts of unholy things, still claimed to be holy. Tell me how many of the so-called fathers of faith are affecting people\u2019s lives like the late Prohet T.B. Joshua? Have they done any crusade that affected people\u2019s lives? How many countries know them? How many presidents have visited their churches and bowed down? You see , if any president comes to your church and bowed down, it is the entire country that bowed.\n\nWho among the pastors or General Overseers is your religious father?\n\nReligious father? No one. I am a spiritual person, I do not have any religious father and I do not care to have. They claim to be fathers, but cannot give anyone feathers to fly. What is happening among members of PFN and CAN, is uncalled for. The system is not working , and we are not getting the desired results.\n\nI believe it was not like this in the past. At what point did things get so bad in the Christendom? Is PFN and CAN\u2019s non-participation at late T B. Joshua\u2019s burial, part of the problems church leaders you are taking about?\n\nObviously, you could see what happened during the death and burial of T. B. Joshua. They did not show up or felt concerned. How would one explain that kind of attitude towards someone they should see as one of them? It is so bad and condenmable.\n\nMany things were said for and against late Prophet T.B. Joshua, how would you describe his lifetime?\n\nYou see, people can say whatever they like. For me, the late T.B.Joshua was a saint during his lifetime. If am given the opportunity to write about him, that is what I will write. If one wants to know about the life of Jesus Christ, the person should look at T.B. Joshua. He lived Christ-like life and won. I do not want to know where his power came from and whether he served a living God or not, but based on what we saw, he lived like Christ. Now, let me shock you, most pastors said he was a wizard, right? Find out, you will see that many of those who said so have married three wives, and will complete it four very soon. But T. B. Joshua who was labeled a wizard had one wife and lived with her till death. They have mansions and estates, but T.B. Joshua they called a wizard did not have a house in his home town. He had no mansion in Lagos. Was it not in his church in Lagos that he was buried? Have you seen where he gave out things to people? He never bothered whether one is a Christian, Muslim or traditionalist. He carried everybody along and saw all as one. That was the real spirit of a true man of God. Obviously he lived a life of selflessness, generosity and practical example of Christ. He touched lives in many ways, which those who called him names have not done, and will not do. If T.B. Joshua was a wizard, I wish I will know where the wizard is, so that I can join. People are still crying because of his death. Among those who cajoIed him, we will see how many people that will cry when they die. I pray that God should crown him. Even though he was a sinner, God will look at the charity he did and have mercy upon him.\n\nWould you say some pastors were envious of the late T. B. Joshua?\n\nI think so. Otherwise they would not be calling him names he did not deserve.\n\nTalking of state of the nation, what are your views?\n\nWe could all see what is happening in almost every part of Nigeria. Each day, we hear of one problem or the other. Hearing the numbers of people killed in various crisis, is nothing to us, unlike in the past, if one or two were killed, Nigerians will shout. What we hear today is; is it only 47 people that were killed? People shed the blood of their fellow humans as if they are animals. In fact, it is a pity that we are in a country that does not value lives of its citizens. I am proud to be an indigene of Imo State, but not proud to be a Nigerian. We should not decieve ourselves, many things have fallen apart in our country. Could you believe that since the COVID-19, I have not travelled to my village in Imo State due to insecurity and crisis everywhere? Though, I have escorts, but I believe that they cannot protect me. It is so bad that the so-called unknown gunmen will kill the escorts and the person they are escorting. My parents are dead, so I have no reason to travel for now until the security situation improves. The economy is bad, there is hunger in the land, and with the way things are going, fuel will be sold for N1,000 very soon. The worst aspect of it is that when someone is doing bad things, you will still see those praising him. Nobody is ready to tell him the truth. Sometimes, I begin to wonder if Buhari knows what is happening in Nigeria.\n\nWhat do you think is the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems?\n\nThe only thing that will help Nigeria, as a nation, is God\u2019s intervention because human\u2019s wisdom and ideas haven\u2019t. I am praying for thunder to strike those who are destroying the nation, so that better people can come in. The analogue leadership we have at present, should give way to the younger generation.\n\nThe agitations for secession by some sections in Nigeria keep increasing, what is your take on that?\n\nWell, I am not comfortable with the way the Federal Government is handling the issue. Arresting Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho is not the best. They should be released. The worst thing that happens is when someone uses gun to fight people with ideology. You see, Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho have penetrate a lot of people. They have many followers. Even a little boy in Nigeria today knows what Biafra is all about. I wish I have my way to talk to President Muhammadu Buhari. I will tell him that dialoguing with the agitators at the round table is the best thing to do. He should not forget that there are millions of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho out there. If anyone doubts it, let him go to the streets. The more you kill them, the more the younger ones come up. As it is, if they like let them use what is more than AK-47 to fight Kanu, one day, Biafra will come to stay. Though, it may not be today or tomorrow.\n\nAre you praying that Nigeria should divide?\n\nI am not praying for that actually, what I want is a better Nigeria. But if we cannot achieve that, why can\u2019t we go our separate ways. I think, that may bring more development and the relative peace we all have been expecting.\n\nYou were given an honorary Doctorate Degree by a Theology University in New York, what does that mean to you?\n\nIt means a lot to me as a servant of God. At least, it shows we are making progress in the vineyard of God. It will encourage and prepare me for further leadership positions.\n\nAs it is, where do you hope to be in the next five to 10 years?\n\nWell, I am aiming and firing higher. I may become the President of Nigeria. I have the plans to contribute to change the political scene for good.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "The Defence Intelligence Agency, the Intelligence arm of the Defence Headquarters has declared a retired Nigerian Navy Commodore, Kunle Olawunmi, wanted for exposing in an interview how the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration refused to probe high profile politicians whom Boko Haram terrorists named as their sponsors.\n\nIt was learnt that the DIA requested Commodore Olawunmi to come to its headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday with his international passport,\n\nA source in the military said: \u201cThe agency has declared retired Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi wanted for spilling the beans over Boko Haram sponsors in the Buhari regime. They asked him to come with his international passport on Tuesday to the DIA office in Abuja.\u201d\n\nNavy Commodore Olawunmi had spoken on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme on Tuesday, condemning attack by bandits on the Kaduna campus of Nigeria\u2019s foremost military university, the Nigerian Defence Academy, where two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\nThe Professor of Global Security Studies had said, \u201cIt is an aberration; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it. In 2017, I carried out an investigation by the Minister of Defence that wanted me to check what was going on with the training and the security there (NDA). I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "From Kabul to Kaduna",
          "text": "ENGAGEMENTS By Chidi Amuta\n\nSeparated by great distance but proximal in influence and geostrategic thinking, Nigeria and Afghanistan are drifting closer. For most Nigerians, Afghanistan is not exactly their next favorite tourist destination. But aspects of Afghanistan\u2019s undulating history of trouble making and theocratic fixations are beginning to resonate more with Nigeria and indeed the rest of the world where jihadist terror has become a permanent concern.\n\nThe strategic importance of the unfolding situation in Afghanistan for our terrorism situation may not immediately concern our security experts. But the two elements that make Afghanistan a country of permanent interest are present here: jihadist violence bred by atrocious governance in a faulty state. If we recognize the interplay of these two elements in our current security headache, we had better stay tuned to the news from Kabul.\n\nIn tandem with the last minute efforts of the US to wrap up what is unarguably a nasty withdrawal and evacuation process, ISSI-K terrorists have bombed the vicinity of Kabul airport, the immediate theatre of the evacuation effort. The attack and its large casualties is a quick reminder to the US and the Taliban that the calculus of power change in Afghanistan must include the presence of terror squads like ISIS and remnants of Al Queda. To the rest of the world, especially in places like Nigeria that are wracked by jihadist terror and governance instability, there is an even more harsh and direct message from Kabul: Jihadists everywhere are emboldened whenever jihadists in one place score a triumph over a perceived great power. At such moments, the good of sectarian puritanism seems to triumph over the evil of the secular corrupt state. Jihadists everywhere jubilate through intensified violence campaigns. A latent terror virus finds oxygen and explodes to infect more places. America\u2019s carelessness has fed a familiar monster which is returning to torment the world.\n\nFor the US and the Biden presidency in particular, this avoidable nasty outcome may not bode well for the politics of the Afghanistan misadventure in Washington. The last minute janitorial oversights may yet cause the Democrats a few sleepless nights unless they can quickly and stoutly remind Americans that Mr. Biden was merely fulfilling an agreement entered into by the tardy Mr. Trump. And in any case, Americans are better off with keeping their dollars at home to pay for weekend shopping and medicare than burying it in sink holes in a hellhole of terror.\n\nIf the containment of terrorism or indeed its reduction was touted as a benefit of the 20-year Afghan mission, this latest attack underlines the falsity of the optimism. Of course terrorist episodes remained an active part of the Afghanistan ecosystem while the American occupation lasted. The several attacks on Kabul and its environs were conveniently attributed to the Taliban.\n\nNow the Taliban is in power. It cannot possibly bomb itself and fellow Afghan citizens. ISIS-K has rudely stepped in to announce its stake as part of the present and future of a bad place. For the Taliban, the terrorist attack at Kabul airport poses an instant credibility problem of immense proportions. The resurgent Taliban that is still clawing its way back to power in Afghanistan is busy making initial noises about a change of heart and a slightly reformed image. No one is certain what Taliban 2.0 really is. It is uncertain if it has overtly abandoned the kind of terrorism that it used to support and sometimes sponsor. The old Taliban would ordinarily turn a blind eye to the kind of gruesome attack that has just taken place in Kabul. In its original format and iteration, the Taliban remains an extremist fundamentalist movement with jihadism at its very foundation. From 1996 to 2000, the purist Sharia driven government of the Taliban distinguished Afghanistan as a safe haven for all manner of terrorist franchises. The challenge of Taliban 2.0 is to redefine its relationship with terrorism. The attitude of the world will fall into place.\n\nWhile the world awaits the full meaning of the unfolding Afghan quagmire, nations with known jihadist terrorism problems can already feel the psychological impact of the Afghanistan outcome. Jihadists all over the world, are likely to be emboldened by the Afghan outcome. Nigeria\u2019s long running Boko Haram enterprise remains an ideological off shoot of both Taliban and ISIS-type extremism and jihadism.\n\nSuch boldness is most likely to enhance the belief that the ultimate vindication of the jihadist campaign in dysfunctional secular states is to conquer and overthrow them. This audacity is reinforced by the atrocious governance record of such failing or faulty states. For instance, the main thrust of international opinion on the reason behind Nigeria\u2019s prolonged jihadist insurgency is the inherent dysfunction and corruption of the state. Says the London Economist: \u201cJihadists in north-eastern Nigeria are hard to beat because locals detest the central government and army officers sell their own men\u2019s weapons to the guerillas and pocket the cash.\u201d\n\nIn addition to deriving original inspiration from the Taliban, Nigeria\u2019s Boko Haram shares traits with classical Taliban. Like the Taliban, Boko Haram subscribes to a medieval version of Islam which abhors western education and modernization. They raze schools and kill teachers. They have the same attitude to the status of women, women\u2019s education and basic freedoms. They enslave women and prefer men with scraggy beards without grooming and have no room for freedom of expression, respect for the media and other manifestations of the open society. Jihad is its driving force. Divine ordained violent retribution against infidels is its fuel while terrorist violence remains its principal vehicle.\n\nTherefore, last Tuesday\u2019s bandit attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) points in a bad direction in the nation\u2019s expanding lethal handshake with jihadist terrorism. So far, two officers are dead while a third, who was abducted by the gunmen, faces an uncertain fate. In the process, the credibility of our military has taken a direct hit. The message is undisguised: a military establishment that cannot protect the officers and men in its premier national academy can hardly reassure the general populace of safety and security. Such a military establishment cannot justify its huge charge on the public purse or indeed its very professional capability. Why did the bandits target the NDA? Our attention should be on the historical and strategic importance of the Defence Academy in our national defence and security profile to date.\n\nSince its establishment in February 1964, the Nigerian Defence Academy has remained the nation\u2019s apex citadel of military training and professional excellence. In these 57 years, the Academy has become the benchmark for establishing the seniority of a succession of officers who have come to lead the Nigerian military and indeed the nation for most of our history both for good and for ill. The NDA is our equivalent of Britain\u2019s Sandhurst, America\u2019s West Point or India\u2019s Indian Military Academy. It is the apex laboratory for the best training that our military can give to its officers, combining strategic, tactical, academic and practical combat training. The standard expectation is that the NDA would showcase the best capacities that our military can boast of. The terrorist attack on the institution is therefore a direct hit at the professional integrity and prestige of the military establishment. This is the first time that the security and professional credibility of the institution would be so brazenly breached and assailed.\n\nOfficial Abuja has not helped itself or the citizenry with its responses to this incident. The usual attempt to find a political spin to anchor this incident has fallen flat on its nose. The attempt to politicize the incident by ascribing it to political opponents has come out as a tragic trivialization and an outright show of official foolishness. To insist, as the president himself has done, that the incident will merely rouse the military into more serious action is simplistic and pedestrian. Nor will the enlightened public buy the claim that this is the handiwork of just casual criminals or political busy bodies.\n\nThe attack on the NDA is plainly what it is: a calculated strategic targeting of a symbolic national military institution by a dangerous and methodical insurgent adversary. That adversary knew what to target, when to strike and the class of casualties to inflict without suffering any itself. This is an enemy that understands news and the value of media. A military training formation that pleads surprise as an excuse for the loss of lives and compromise of its space is deficient. The enemy that struck the NDA seems fairly determined to strike at the vertebra of national security with a clear message. That message was delivered with devastating effect. It is a bad message of demonstrating the vulnerability of even our most respected and best protected national security institutions and high points.\n\nWe cannot diminish the import of this incident by ascribing it to bandits loosely defined as squads of opportunistic criminals out to extort money from government and individuals. That is simplistic, lazy and na\u00efve. Opportunistic business minded bandits cannot be so foolish as to expect to make money out of an attack on a government military installation. The accounting process is long and laborious. No individual will feel so pained as to dole out huge sums because the NDA was attacked and its officers abducted or killed. And in any case, why kill your captives if you need a ransom? Abducting a low level army officer in expectation of a ransom in hundreds of millions of Naira does not quite make sense. To do so in a city full of low risk targets with immense commercial heft does not fit into the mind set of any entrepreneurial set of criminals who want to carry out successful abductions and live to enjoy the loot of an attractive ransom.\n\nOnly a jihadist minded set of gunmen would dare to attack a military institution of the level of the NDA where they should expect stiff resistance. The operation was carried out fully mindful of the symbolism of the NDA in relation to the risk. To have done it and inflicted casualties without suffering any themselves indicates some degree of training and preparation that should be of interest to serious investigators. And in any event, jihadist terrorists do not care about death since it guarantees them instant martyrdom and the ultimate reward of virgins and eternal happiness in heaven.\n\nIt is foolish for our security people to continue seeing the bandits roaming most of the northern states as free mercantile agents without either an ideological or political compass. There is a contrary belief that sees the so-called bandits as the roving department of the larger Boko Haram jihadist movement. They consist of operatives trained, indoctrinated and armed by the parent organization. As foot soldiers, they have shown very good weapons training. They are more mobile than the more administratively minded master organization. They operate in smaller formations and can spread out to a wider targeted or designated territory. Their political guidance and target selection seems to be centrally controlled. More importantly, the bandits seem to be a mobile fund -raising machinery of Boko Haram. They demand and collect ransom in large sums as against the small taxes and rates collected by the parent organization. Their ransom collections seems to be geared towards reinvestment in new stocks of armaments and remittance to the parent organization for heavy logistics outlays. The funds are moved around through shadowy conduits including bureau de change operators and sundry unlicensed money changers.\n\nSensitive observers and analysts ought to have noted the ease with which some of their captives and abductees end up in Boko Haram camps should be of interest to our managers of violence. It would also be of further interest to security analysts to explore the relationship between the roving bandits of the northern ecosystem and the itinerant herdsmen accompanying cattle in the southern states who in the last six years have suddenly showed up with military grade assault rifles to terrorize communities, highways and settlements, robbing, killing and collecting ransom as well.\n\nWe should also be interested in the territorial focus of bandits and their operations. The axis of coverage now spans Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger and parts of Nassarawa states with active operational flanks out to Plateau and Benue states. The most intense theatre of bandit interest seems to be Kaduna state and Kaduna city. The strategic importance of Kaduna state in matters of sectarian violence and religion inspired instability have been a permanent part of successive disruptions. In addition to being the headquarters of the original northern region, Kaduna remains attractive as the location of a number of strategic military and civilian government institutions. The long standing historical restive relationship between native Hausa and settler Fulani populations has remained a matter of serious security interest in the story of our national insecurity. It becomes a soft fault line for bandit infiltration and activity for ends that go beyond criminal extortion and ransom collection.\n\nBy most sensible intelligence estimates, there is a clear and present danger that Boko Haram and its affiliate terror squads have their eyes trained on Abuja. They have all shown a common interest in disrupting the business of the government in Abuja if only to demonstrate their capacity to challenge the prevailing sovereignty. There are very recent indications that Boko Haram is expanding its theatre of operation southwards. From its original base in the North East, Boko Haram activities have spread to Yobe, Katsina, Zamfara and lately Niger State. The governor of Niger State recently revealed that Boko Haram has taken over control of five local governments in the state and was within two hours of Abuja.\n\nThe highway between Abuja and Kaduna has become a favourite operational thoroughfare and playground of all manner of bandits and gunmen. Similarly, at the height of the Shiite campaign to free Mr. El Zakzakky, militants of the sect freely invaded Abuja and quickly turned the central business district of the city into a battle theatre of free exchange of fire with security forces. Taken together, therefore, there is a palpable but latent strategic instability around Abuja.\n\nThe city of Abuja seems surrounded by both sectarian and criminal armed threats united by a common interest in subversive disruption of the Nigerian state. Concerned interest groups and leadership factions in Nigeria have already begun to caution President Buhari to be mindful of the political risk of jihadist bandits and terror squads hovering around the northern precincts of the country. Opposition from partisan political adversaries can make Buhari uncomfortable. It is only the concerted onslaught of a coalition of Boko Haram militants and their bandit foot soldiers that pose a danger of overrunning Abuja and occupying Aso Rock Villa which they see as the citadel of an evil empire.\n\nIn all of this, there are overriding strategic implications that ought to challenge our security managers to reach beyond surface solutions. An internal security strategy that cannot see the interconnections among all jihadist forces operating to subvert the Nigerian state would fall flat on its face.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Legendary Nigerian Musician, Victor Uwaifo, Dies at 80",
          "text": "By Vanessa Obioha\n\nLegendary musician, Sir Victor Uwaifo, who was the first Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Tourism in Nigeria, is dead. The news of.his death was announced by his son Uwaifo Peter de Rock on Facebook. He was said to have died after a brief illness.\n\nHis son said his death came after a week of collaborating with him.\n\nUwaifo wore many hats beyond his music. He was in a class of his own. He was an athlete with an unbroken record, an inventor, a visual artist and a sculptor. He was an academic, earning a First Class in Fine Arts.\n\nHe excelled in everything he did.\n\nPopularly known as the \u2018Guitar Boy\u2019, the deceased was also the first professional musician to be awarded the National Merit Honours of Member of the Order of the Niger (MON). He was invited to the State House by four Presidents and Heads of State of Nigeria.\n\nUwaifo was born in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria and obtained his secondary school education at the Western Boys\u2019 High School Benin and St Gregory\u2019s College, Lagos, from 1957 to 1961. He began playing the guitar when he was 12 years old, his earliest popular music influences being Spanish and Latin American music.\n\nWhile in St Gregory\u2019s College, he played music and was among the leading Lagos high school bandleaders. As a young man, he played in different bands like the late Victor Olaiya, late E.C Arinze, Stephen Osadebe and Fred Coker before forming his band Melody Maestros. The band released the hit single \u2018Joromi\u2019 which became a popular hit and the most sampled song from his vast catalogue of music.\n\nHe developed the Akwete rhythm sound and in 1969, launched a new beat called Shadow accompanied by a new dance also called Shadow, a mixture of Akwete and twist.\n\nHe was the first among his peers to attain monumental fame when he sold over 1,000 copies of his album, making him the first winner of a gold disc on the internet. He would later win seven other gold discs in the \u2018Guitar boy\u2019, \u2018Arabade\u2019, \u2018Ekassa\u2019 series and \u2018Akwete\u2019 music.\n\nIn \u2018Elder\u2019s Corner\u2019, a documentary film by musicians Ade Bantu and Siji Awoyinka, Uwaifo described music as spiritual.\n\n\u201cThere is a telepathy in music,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also lamented how the country forgets its pioneering music stars.\n\n\u201cIt must be a devil\u2019s trick to be born in a country where neither soul nor talent is appreciated.\u201d\n\nUwaifo\u2019s love for music and the arts was ingrained. It showed in everything he did.\n\nHe built a museum in his premises in Benin which houses some of the greatest artworks he did. For instance, he told the history of Nigeria through visuals and combined them with sounds to create a real-life effect.\n\nA consummate artist, he was perhaps the only professional who excelled in arts and sciences. He invented a musical instrument, the double-neck guitar which he played, an aeroplane and a car which are all in his museum. THISDAY Group Politics Editor Nseobong Okon-Ekong who spent two days in his house in 2008 described him as one of Nigeria\u2019s greats.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Nigerian like him.\u201d\n\nAt 77, Uwaifo obtained a PhD in Architectural Sculpture from the University of Benin. His thesis was on \u2018A Reinvention of Benin Royal Ancestral Pieces\u2019. He was a lecturer at the Department of Fine and Applied Arts at the same university and was the Chairman of Joromi Organization, a multi-track recording and television studio in Benin City.\n\nBantu recalled the deceased as a true renaissance man.\n\n\u201cVictor Uwaifo was one of a kind, a true renaissance man who effortlessly wore multiple hats be it as a musician, sculptor, inventor, politician or educator. His outstanding musical catalogue won him a dedicated and loyal fan base that cut across generations. Never one to rest on past laurels, Uwaifo was always pushing his restless creativity while charting new ways to reinvent and express himself. Sir Victor Uwaifo, the \u2018Guitar Boy\u2019 was a force of nature, his charm and charisma were infectious and disarming.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, in a career that spanned over 60 years, he amazingly kept a clean slate and was scandal-free. He was known to be athletic even as he advanced in age.\n\nThe deceased celebrated his 80th birthday last March.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Defence Intelligence Agency has declared a former Nigerian Navy Commodore, Kunle Olawunmi, wanted for exposing in an interview how the President Muhammadu Buhari's administration refused to probe high profile politicians whom Boko Haram terrorists named as their sponsors.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the DIA asked Olawunmi to come to its headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday with his international passport, which may be seized.\n\nThe Defence Intelligence Agency is the primary military intelligence agency of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe agency has declared retired Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi wanted for spilling the beans over Boko Haram sponsors in the Buhari regime. They asked him to come with his international passport on Tuesday to the DIA office in Abuja,\u201d a top source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had last Wednesday reported that Olawunmi spoke when he featured on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme.\n\nHe had condemned Tuesday's attack by bloodthirsty bandits on the Kaduna campus of Nigeria\u2019s foremost military university, the Nigerian Defence Academy, where two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\nThe Professor of Global Security Studies had said, \u201cIt is an aberration; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it. In 2017, I carried out an investigation by the Minister of Defence that wanted me to check what was going on with the training and the security there (NDA). I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had also said that the Department of State Services had tremendous information on terrorists but they could not do anything except by the body language of the Commander-In-Chief.",

They asked him to come with his international passport on Tuesday to the DIA office in Abuja,\u201d a top source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had last Wednesday reported that Olawunmi spoke when he featured on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme.\n\nHe had condemned Tuesday's attack by bloodthirsty bandits on the Kaduna campus of Nigeria\u2019s foremost military university, the Nigerian Defence Academy, where two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\nThe Professor of Global Security Studies had said, \u201cIt is an aberration; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it. In 2017, I carried out an investigation by the Minister of Defence that wanted me to check what was going on with the training and the security there (NDA). I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had also said that the Department of State Services had tremendous information on terrorists but they could not do anything except by the body language of the Commander-In-Chief.",

          "text": "Mike Okonkwo, the presiding Bishop of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), has said the South-East should not produce a presidency on the grounds of pity.\n\nHe pointed out that the South-East should not allow themselves to produce a president so they can be appeased.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Lagos, the TREM founder stressed that a presidency produced under such a condition would not succeed.\n\nAccording to Okonkwo: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the easterners are not asking for anything other than live and let live.\n\n\u201cThey are not saying, \u2018give us everything\u2019. For me, to be honest with you, I am not in agreement with any easterner saying, \u2018it\u2019s time for us to be president\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo you should beg to be president? If it\u2019s going to be a case of making you president so that you can be appeased, that is stupidity; I don\u2019t want that. You are a Nigerian; you have an equal right to everything that every other person in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not a matter of being appeased. In fact, I don\u2019t even want any easterner under this situation to be a president because he will fail. Do you know why? The present system can never allow you to succeed. That is why we have to look at the system.\u201d\n\nHis comment is coming when people of the Southeast have been agitating for the presidency ahead of 2023.\n\nComrade Igboayaka Igboayaka, the National President Ohaneze Youth Council, OYC, said an Igbo presidency would favour Nigerians more.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said the country\u2019s Southern part should be allowed to produce Nigeria\u2019s next president.\n\nHowever, Northerners have insisted that the North still has four years at the end of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second tenure.\n\nArewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, had said the Southern part of the country had ruled Nigeria for 14 years while the North would have ruled for ten years at the end of Buhari\u2019s second tenure.",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii.

The articles further reported that the Transmission Company of Nigeria Plc (\u201cTCN\u201d) has been directed by the Commission to disconnect certain customers as a consequence of the suspension of the said regulations.\n\nThe Commission, in a statement by Usman Abba Arabi, its General Manager, Public Affairs Department, noted that the Eligible Customer Regulations (\u201cECR\u201d) has NOT been suspended and at no time has the Commission issued a directive for discontinuation of service to any customer. The ECR was developed and approved by the Commission, pursuant to a declaration made by the Honourable Ministry of Power as provided under section 27 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (\u201cEPSRA\u201d). The regulations provide for conditions for the grant of eligibility status by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission further issued the guidelines for filing for competitive transition charge (\u201cCTC\u201d) to account for loss of revenue by DisCos in compliance with section 28 of the Act. In this regard, electricity consumers across the country that comply with the provisions of the Eligible Customer Regulations may avail themselves of the bilateral contracting opportunities presented by the intent of the provisions in the EPSRA and the ECR.\n\nThe Commission has noted references to our letter to the Market Operator and being referred to as a directive for discontinuation of supply to certain customers. We wish to state that this was a straightforward directive of the industry regulator restraining the TCN from recognising unauthorised eligible customer transactions in the market settlement statement without the prior approval of the Commission. The Commission further directed all unauthorised EC transactions to revert to BILLING by the distribution companies (\u201cDisCos\u201d) operating in the franchise area where the customers are located but without disruption in supply until the customer is conferred with eligibility status pursuant to the requirement of the\n\nECR. It is important to note that whereas the majority of these customers pursuing EC status have always been served through 132kV transmission lines, the billing of the customers resides with the distribution companies (\u201cDisCos\u201d) unless a customer elects to purchase energy under the framework of the ECR.\n\nON SEEKING ELIGIBLE CUSTOMER STATUS\n\nThe Eligible Customer Regulations was designed to provide a very simple process for securing eligibility status from the Commission for customer whose consumption is in excess of the minimum threshold of 2MWh/h over a period of one month. The key conditions for the grant of the EC status are as follows:\n\n\u2013 Evidence of no indebtedness to DisCos: An eligible customer applicant is obligated to show that it is not indebted to the existing supplier before it can be conferred with eligibility to switch a supplier of electricity. Many of the applicants for eligibility status are, however, unable to provide this evidence due to a pending settlement dispute with their respective DisCos.\n\n\u2013 The supplier (GenCo OR trading licensee) to the potential eligible customer should possess an unencumbered generation capacity to sell to other customers.\n\n\u2013 Evidence of an agreement with the supplier of last resort in compliance with sections 37 and 38 of ECR. This is to ensure a continuity of supply to the eligible customer, in the event of a disruption by the contracted GenCo.\n\nThe aforementioned conditions provided in the light-handed EC regulations issued by the Commission are designed to preserve the structure and orderliness of the electricity market while opening opportunities for competition and better service for consumers. Electricity consumers meeting the consumption threshold of 2MWh/h wishing to avail themselves of the opportunity of purchasing electricity from sources other than DisCos are encouraged to apprise themselves of the guiding regulations of the industry and not rely on the presumption of compliance. GenCos wishing to sell electricity to consumers under the eligible customer framework are mandatorily required to possess an unencumbered generation capacity for sale to other consumers.\n\nThe public is further invited to note that a number of eligible customer application before the Commission are stalled by the inability of either the applicants or their potential suppliers to fulfil the conditions precedent for grant of eligibility in compliance with sections 5, 6, 23, 37 and 38, and schedules 1A & 1B of ECR. These conditions are easily within the reach and control of the applicants and the potential suppliers. Other reasons constraining the grant of eligible customer status to some major consumers of electricity include various litigations and/or objections to applications filed with the Commission.\n\nThe Commission is committed to opening up the electricity supply industry for competition and new investments. We are committed to granting timely approvals to all applicants who have met the conditions for eligibility status as provided in the eligible customer regulations. We will, however, continue to be firm on orderliness and compliance with the regulations, Order and operating codes guiding the electricity industry.\n\nEmail: [email protected] [email protected];\n\nlike us on and visit our website www.nercng.org",

          "text": "Three residents of Maryland, United States, face indictment for attempting to illegally export arms and ammunition to Nigeria.\n\nThe Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Maryland said the suspects allegedly exported arms and ammunition without obtaining export licenses, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act.\n\nThe announcement, release on Friday, states:\n\nA federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging three Maryland men for the federal charges of conspiracy, violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act, related to the export of firearms and ammunition from the United States to Nigeria.\n\nCharged in the indictment, which was returned late yesterday, are:\n\nWilson Nuyila Tita, age 45, of Owings Mills, Maryland;\n\nEric Fru Nji, age 40, of Fort Washington, Maryland; and\n\nWilson Che Fonguh, age 39, of Bowie, Maryland.\n\nThe indictment was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; and Special Agent in Charge Timothy Jones of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Baltimore Field Division.\n\nAccording to the four-count indictment, from at least November 2017 through July 19, 2019, the defendants conspired with each other and with others to export from the United States to Nigeria defense articles and items identified on the United States Munitions List (\u201cUSML\u201d) and the Commerce Control List (\u201cCCL\u201d) without first obtaining export licenses.\n\nThe defendants also allegedly conspired to conceal from the United States that those items were being shipped from the Port of Baltimore in Maryland to Nigeria and at least one other location in Africa. The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly contributed funds for the purchase of firearms, ammunition, reloading materials and other equipment for shipping overseas. The indictment alleges that the defendants and their co-conspirators communicated about their efforts and plans to ship weapons and ammunitions using an on-line encrypted messaging application and code words in order to conceal their activities.\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the defendants and other conspirators concealed the firearms, ammunition, rifle scopes, and other items in heavily wrapped packages and duffle bags, and inside sealed compressor units, placing those items into a shipping container destined for Nigeria without obtaining the requisite licenses from the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Further, as part of the conspiracy, one of the co-conspirators allegedly caused the submission of electronic export information to the U.S. government for the container which listed materially false information as to the identity of the exporter and the intermediate and ultimate consignee, as well as the ultimate destination of the container\u2019s contents.\n\nSpecifically, the indictment alleges that on January 17, 2019, the defendants and their co-conspirators exported, attempted to export, or caused to be exported to Nigeria articles on the USML the export of which was controlled under the Arms Export Control Act, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of State, specifically: 38 semi-automatic firearms; over 35,000 rounds of ammunition; and 44 magazines. On that same day, the defendants allegedly exported to Nigeria one Bushnell Trophy Rifle Optic and one Burris AR Rifle Scope, the export of which were controlled under the Commerce Control List, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Finally, the indictment alleges that the defendants transported 28 firearms with obliterated serial numbers, including 18 rifles.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants each face a mandatory sentence of five years in federal prison for the conspiracy; a maximum of 20 years in federal prison each for violating the Arms Export Control Act and for violating the Export Control Reform Act; and a maximum of five years in federal prison for transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. The defendants are each expected to have an initial appearance this afternoon in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas M. DiGirolamo beginning at 3:00 p.m.\n\nAn indictment is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.\n\nSeven defendants have been charged in related cases and of those six have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.\n\nActing United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended HSI and the ATF for their work in the investigation. Mr. Lenzner recognized the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement; U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service; Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Naval Criminal Investigative Service; and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their contributions to the investigation. Acting U.S. Attorney Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathleen O. Gavin, who is prosecuting the federal case.",

          "text": "Three residents of Maryland, United States of America, face indictment for attempting to illegally export arms and ammunition to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Maryland, the suspects allegedly exported arms and ammunition without obtaining export licenses, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act.\n\nThe announcement, release on Friday, states:\n\nA federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging three Maryland men for the federal charges of conspiracy, violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Reform Control Act, related to the export of firearms and ammunition from the United States to Nigeria.\n\nCharged in the indictment, which was returned late yesterday, are:\n\nWilson Nuyila Tita, age 45, of Owings Mills, Maryland;\n\nEric Fru Nji, age 40, of Fort Washington, Maryland; and\n\nWilson Che Fonguh, age 39, of Bowie, Maryland.\n\nThe indictment was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; and Special Agent in Charge Timothy Jones of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Baltimore Field Division.\n\nAccording to the four-count indictment, from at least November 2017 through July 19, 2019, the defendants conspired with each other and with others to export from the United States to Nigeria defense articles and items identified on the United States Munitions List (\u201cUSML\u201d) and the Commerce Control List (\u201cCCL\u201d) without first obtaining export licenses.\n\nThe defendants also allegedly conspired to conceal from the United States that those items were being shipped from the Port of Baltimore in Maryland to Nigeria and at least one other location in Africa. The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly contributed funds for the purchase of firearms, ammunition, reloading materials and other equipment for shipping overseas. The indictment alleges that the defendants and their co-conspirators communicated about their efforts and plans to ship weapons and ammunitions using an on-line encrypted messaging application and code words in order to conceal their activities.\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the defendants and other conspirators concealed the firearms, ammunition, rifle scopes, and other items in heavily wrapped packages and duffle bags, and inside sealed compressor units, placing those items into a shipping container destined for Nigeria without obtaining the requisite licenses from the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Further, as part of the conspiracy, one of the co-conspirators allegedly caused the submission of electronic export information to the U.S. government for the container which listed materially false information as to the identity of the exporter and the intermediate and ultimate consignee, as well as the ultimate destination of the container\u2019s contents.\n\nSpecifically, the indictment alleges that on January 17, 2019, the defendants and their co-conspirators exported, attempted to export, or caused to be exported to Nigeria articles on the USML the export of which was controlled under the Arms Export Control Act, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of State, specifically: 38 semi-automatic firearms; over 35,000 rounds of ammunition; and 44 magazines. On that same day, the defendants allegedly exported to Nigeria one Bushnell Trophy Rifle Optic and one Burris AR Rifle Scope, the export of which were controlled under the Commerce Control List, without first having obtained the required license or written approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Finally, the indictment alleges that the defendants transported 28 firearms with obliterated serial numbers, including 18 rifles.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants each face a mandatory sentence of five years in federal prison for the conspiracy; a maximum of 20 years in federal prison each for violating the Arms Export Control Act and for violating the Export Control Reform Act; and a maximum of five years in federal prison for transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

          "text": "Tunde Bakare said he has no problem with David Oyedepo, the founder of Winners\u2019 Chapel, but admitted they share different doctrines and beliefs.\n\nThe founder of Citadel Global Community Church (formerly Latter Rain Assembly), stated this on Saturday while speaking on TVC about his relationship with fellow Pentecostal pastors in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cOyedepo and I are contemporaries. We were born in the same year.\n\n\u201cOyedepo was born in August 1954, and I was born in September. We are contemporaries, God has really blessed him and used him.\n\n\u201cWe have differences in doctrines, what we believe, but that does not make us enemies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is (a) difference between issues and persons. We can defend the gospel but those who do not and destroy it will die before their time. I have nothing personal against any man of God but I will always defend the truth that I know and I will always make it plain.\u201d\n\nBakare added that he and Oyedepo were on a plane one time and another brother was coming over to greet him, but on seeing them together, he froze.\n\nWhen asked whether the incident was before Mr Oyedepo acquired his private jet, Mr Bakare said;\n\n\u201cBy the way, when he makes noise about his private jet of a thing, do you know that I once acquired a 1707 with the logo of our church on it? Are you aware of that? But we use it for business. I don\u2019t buy a plane to be spending money on it, that I can jump quickly on another and pay little money to where I\u2019m going.\n\n\u201cWe can afford it; we are not envious of them at all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on his differences withOyedepo, Bakare accused the Winner\u2019s Chapel founder of twisting the truth.\n\nBakare said when someone \u201cbegins to twist the truth to make it funny,\u201d he will speak out.\n\n\u201cIt is a true friend that speaks true to his friend. Mantras will die before their time.\n\n\u201cWhen you speak the truth, eventually when the truth begins to rule, there will be no element of falsehood,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bakare also referenced an incident where he tore a book written by Mr Oyedepo in the open and when he was confronted, he said the book was full of errors.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can someone say the anointing oil is not a symbol of the Holy Spirit? It is the release of God in the bottle. If it is told to few people so, it is okay. If anointing oil is the Holy Spirit, then Jesus is a lamb walking on four legs. They are symbols, and symbols are not as important.\u201d\n\nBakare also spoke about his relationship with Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Church of God.\n\nHe said Adeboye signed his wedding certificate as his father and he built his first house on the campground being a favored son.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is only bastards that use (the) left hand to point to the house of his father.\u201d\n\nMr Bakare also confirmed that he was a member of Deeper Life Church for about five years before he went to the Redeemed Church.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call those men my colleagues. They are my fathers,\u201d he said, speaking of Mr Adeboye and William Kumuyi of the Deeper Life Bible Church.",

          "text": "By Cecilia Ologunagba\n\nNo fewer than 100 million African children have been vaccinated against polio in the past one year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.\n\nWHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti said that although COVID-19 had threatened the success of polio vaccination, it was possible to overcome the final hurdles.\n\nMoeti, in a statement, stated that WHO had the know-how, but needed to be backed by committed resources to reach all under-vaccinated communities.\n\nThe polio programme has a history of supporting the response to emerging health threats in the region, including Ebola and COVID-19, and half of polio surge staff are currently helping countries with COVID-19 surveillance, contact tracing and community engagement.\n\nAccording to WHO, African states overseen by the African Regional Office of WHO remained committed to ending all remaining forms of polio.\n\nThe Regional Office has also presented a scorecard to track progress towards the eradication of the virus as the Africa was certified free of wild poliovirus one year ago, after four years without a case.\n\nHowever, outbreaks of a vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is spreading in African communities where too few children have received the polio vaccine.\n\ncVDPV is a weakened strain of the virus that has changed over time and behaves more like the naturally occurring poliovirus.\n\nSince 2018, 23 African countries have experienced outbreaks and more than half of the 1071 global cVDPV cases were recorded in Africa.\n\nAccording to WHO, cases increased in 2020 partly because of disruptions to polio vaccination campaigns caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, WHO has said that the next three months will be a critical period for stepping up global collective action against future pandemics, citing three major meetings on the international agenda.\n\nWHO is progressing with plans to strengthen global defense against future epidemics and pandemics, he said, pointing at the UN General Assembly in September, followed by the G20 Summit in October, and a special session of WHO\u2019s governing body set for November.\n\nThe next three months, therefore, represent \u201ca critical period for shaping the future of pandemic preparedness and response\u201d, he added\n\nWHO said that the commitments came at the just concluded virtual 71st meeting of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa.",

Why APC should be elected again in 2023, then who benefits comes second, because, there has to be APC.\n\n\u201cAPC has to be strong enough to win an election before we can have a successful candidate.\n\n\u201cWhat is before APC now is bringing out credible leaders that will do what is right for this country.\n\n\u201cAs a party, all of us should go back to our locality and make sure that we have good people leading the party. If we have good people leading the party, the product from their leadership will always be good.\n\n\u201cAt an appropriate time, I will reply you,\u201d Governor Masari said.\n\nThe PCG group leader, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed, had said their membership cut across all sectors in the country, including serving and past Governors, current and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the group, Prof. Osinbajo would make a great leader and they are confident that he would fly the party\u2019s flag very high and consolidate on President Buhari\u2019s achievement.\n\nAhmed further said they are convinced that Osinbajo as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will calm nerves, foster unity and stability for the nation, considering his wealth of experience and capacity.\n\n\u201cProf Yemi Osinbajo is very ably qualified to continue the policies and programmes of President Buhari, beyond 2023.\n\n\u201cThis is our conviction and we firmly believe that collectively, all parts of the country should join us on this mission of fielding the best among us come 2023 for a greater Nigeria in line with the dreams of our founding fathers and the aspirations of our people\n\n\u201cIt is in view of this development that we at the PCG feel convinced that an Osinbajo Presidency come 2023 will bring down tension, facilitate unity and stability as well as accelerate further progress in all sectors of the economy,\u201d the coordinator said.",

In the FCT, payment recommences for a total of 23,893 beneficiaries across 3 Area Councils, Abaji, Kuje and Kwali.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry has directed the NCTO to proceed with a phased migration of the beneficiaries from offline payment systems to open online systems using accounts opened by licensed Payment Service Providers PSPs that include Commercial Banks, Microfinance Banks, Payments Service Banks and Mobile Money Operators.\n\n\u201cWith this development, beneficiaries can access or control their accounts through the use of Personal Identification Numbers PIN, perform all transactions like withdrawals, bank transfers and bill payments etc. For now, 25% of the beneficiaries are targeted, and we will gradually extend this to all beneficiaries as far as the industry constraints would allow\u201d.\n\nIn her address, the Coordinator of the Conditional Cash Transfer Programme Hajiya Halima Shehu thanked the minister for the recommencement of the programme which has now been upgraded for transparency and equity.\n\n\u201cThis program focuses on digitization and financial inclusion. The Honourable minister must be commended for her relentless efforts in transforming the\n\nConditional Cash Transfer Programme from the one that brings beneficiaries\u2019 stipends through virtual accounts to the one that is now transactional with features for savings, withdrawals and transfer of funds. This will enable the beneficiaries to have sustainable transactional accounts to meet the current economic realities\u201d, Shehu said.\n\nEarlier, the National Coordinator Dr Umar Bindir urged the beneficiaries to make good use of the stipends and also borrow interest-free loans from the revamped Government Enterprise Empowerment Programme GEEP 2.0 which was launched on Tuesday.\n\nThe CCT which is an approved partnership with the World Bank is designed and developed as a safety nets programme for Nigeria under a broad-based platform of the National Social Safety Nets Project NASSP.",

Pragmatism is the best strategy for Ndigbo to kill two birds with one stone, because if APGA fuses into APC that will gift APC with three states in the Southeast geopolitical zone \u2013 a milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith three strategic states of Southeast in APC\u2019s kitty, that is a halfway stroke to Ndigbo\u2019s ambition of achieving Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Therefore, I implore you to kindly consider the fruit in APGA joining APC to win the Anambra governorship. Other details will be cordially harmonized.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy take is that if the two parties-APGA and APC-come together under one bloc, it would then be possible for us to weigh the two flag bearers, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo and Senator Andy Uba, on the scale of which of them could better win the election in terms of acceptability, integrity, public service record, capacity and vision for good governance,\u201d the VON DG stated.\n\nOkechukwu, while faulting the claim by Chinedu Obidigwe that APC was plotting a forceful takeover of Anambra State insisted that the feasibility of his suggestion could be seen from the political understanding between the All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cwe must recall that in 1999, based on strategic thinking, AD and APP were merged for the Presidential election.\n\n\u201cBut, although the powers that be wanted Chief Olusegun Obasanjo of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), every stakeholder in APP and AD, and indeed all progressive Nigerians saw the political understanding as a win-win offering on the ballot. So, with the benefit of hindsight, I am seeing the same opportunity for APGA and APC in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nObidigwe, the National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors, had in a statement to journalists, criticised Okechukwu for asking APGA to integrate fully into APC and join the mainstream of Nigeria politics so as to help Igbo pick the Presidential seat in 2023.\n\nBut, Okechukwu told reporters in Abuja, yesterday, that APGA was missing the point by seeking to remain as a big fish in a small pond of regional politics that has only earned it just one state out of the entire federation.\n\nHe insisted that APGA can, apart from solving its intractable myriad of post-governorship primary litigations join its old ally, APC, to win the governorship, insisted on doing the same thing the same way and expecting a different result.\n\nThe VON DG pleaded with APGA leaders to give serious thoughts to his pragmatic suggestions, noting that indeed the time has come for APGA to explore other avenues to achieve the collective purpose for Ndigbo by teaming up with APC.\n\n\u201cThis tunnel vision of rigid partisanship has remained the bane of Southeast politics. Therefore, I am still calling on my friends in APGA to look up and count the stars. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari restored Governor Obiano\u2019s security details on the APC governorship campaign ground. In 2019, Obiano led APGA to reciprocate the grand political gesture of understanding by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, would it not make for a greater political impact and success, if APGA consummates what its leaders started right from 2014 by embracing APC in a closer embrace? They should show patriotism and respect for the campaign for Nigeria President of Igbo extraction by joining the mainstream, which APC\u2019s victory in the governorship poll will enhance,\u201d Okechukwu contended.",

          "text": "Manchester City put a difficult week behind them by cruising to a 5-0 victory over 10-man Arsenal on Saturday.\n\nThe result comes amid a tumultuous few days for the champions. Pep Guardiola\u2019s side failed in their attempts to sign Tottenham striker Harry Kane earlier in the week before seeing rivals Manchester United beat them to the signature of Cristiano Ronaldo, with City still in the market for a striker in the final days of the transfer window.\n\nThey may be frustrated in their bid to get more attacking inforcements but City had no problems on the pitch, securing an 11th win in 12 matches over their feckless opponents.\n\nThe North Londoners\u2019 early season struggles continued, though, as they lost a third match in row. Not since 1954-55 have the club suffered such a poor start to a league campaign, with pressure increasing on Mikel Arteta in charge. He wasn\u2019t helped by Granit Xhaka\u2019s sending off in the first half, and the afternoon quickly turned into a damage limitation exercise from there.\n\nIlkay Gundogan opened the scoring on six minutes before Ferran Torres quickly added another and Gabriel Jesus made it 3-0 just before half time. Rodri made it four on 52 minutes and Torres netted a fifth on 84 minutes to complete the rout.\n\nThere was some cheer for the home supporters prior to kickoff, with the club unveiling two statues for Manchester City legends Vincent Kompany and David Silva outside the Etihad. Fittingly, there were plenty of statutes in the visiting backline, despite Arteta\u2019s defensive team selection.\n\nArteta, who previously served as Guardiola\u2019s assistant at City, sprang a surprise as he made four changes, with Calum Chambers, Sead Kolasniac, Martin Odegaard and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang coming in, and he used three centre-backs in a back five in a bid to stifle City\u2019s array of attacking talent.\n\nBut Arsenal soon fell behind. Jesus\u2019 cross found Gundogan at the back post and he nodded past Bernd Leno to put the home side in front. Gundogan almost made it 2-0 moments later, but Leno came out to deny him.\n\nArsenal were rattled, and soon further behind. Arteta\u2019s defence was a shambles and Torres made it two on 11 minutes, evading his marker and flicking the ball home with ease.\n\nIt soon got worse. Xhaka\u2019s mindless decision to jump into a tackle on Joao Cancelo two-footed gave referee Martin Atkinson no option but to send him off and after just 36 minutes, some away fans had seen enough and made their way to the exit.\n\nThose who stayed were left reeling, with Jack Grealish wriggling down the left and finding Jesus, who smashed in from close range to finish the game as a contest.\n\nSaturday marked 10 years to the day that Arsenal suffered an 8-2 hammering at Manchester United and Arteta, who signed for the club in the aftermath of that defeat, must have had that sinking feeling again soon after half time. Rodri side-footed a beautiful effort from outside the box into the bottom corner to deepen the gloom on City\u2019s opponents.\n\nThere was still time for more embarrassment for Arsenal, with Torres grabbing his second of the game on 84 minutes when he nodded past Leno to make it five.\n\nAt one stage recording 97% possession, it was a stroll in the sunshine for City, while Arsenal\u2019s hunt for their first point \u2014 and goal \u2014 of the season continued.",
