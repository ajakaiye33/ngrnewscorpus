He had said he would react at the appropriate time.\n\nPDP chieftains and his supporters thronged the Gombe Airport to welcome him, a development that led to a gridlock in the metropolis.\n\nHe waved at his supporters before heading for his vehicle.\n\nIn a brief interview with journalists at the airport, the PDP chairman in the state Maj.

          "text": "The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, said on Saturday that N157bn had so far been spent on the construction of the second Niger Bridge.\n\nSpeaking at the site after a joint inspection with the Managing Director of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, Uche Orji, the Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Gilbert Ibezim, and other top government officials, the minister said the project was dear to the President as it would be of great benefit to the people of the South-East and other parts of the country.\n\nShe applauded Julius Berger for its innovations in executing the project and for engaging women in the project.\n\nAhmed stated, \u201cToday is a very significant day in the construction circle of the second Niger Bridge, this is one of the most iconic projects in the country, costed at an initial contract sum of N205bn.\n\n\u201cToday, we have been able to fund this project with N157bn and I\u2019m here to see where all this money is going. Also, the significance of today is that the two ends of the bridge are being put together and this is the final phase of the work in truly completing the project.\n\n\u201cSo, technically I can report to Mr President that I have seen where all the N157bn has gone. This is a project that is very dear to the President and it is designed to uplift the lives and livelihood of the people of the South-East and other parts of the country. We do hope that when this project comes on stream, it will ease traffic, enhance commercial activities and improve the lives of the people of the state.\n\n\u201cAlso, I am happy to see ladies, and not all men, at the construction site. Julius Berger has brought some very unique innovations in the construction of this project and I want to on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria applaud the skills of the construction workers that have been working on this site.\u201d\n\nShe said the project created about 20,000 jobs at the construction site.\n\nThe NSIA MD said the project was one of the three projects being funded from the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund. The two other projects are the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Road and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nOrji said, \u201cThe PIDF is a special fund set up by President Muhammadu Buhari and managed by the NSIA. The NSIA brought some of its own capital, the capital provided by the Federal Government and the capital from the Sani Abacha loot that was returned.\n\n\u201cThe NSIA is an investment institution owned by all the states, the federal and local governments and other shareholders of the NSIA. Other people that would invest in the project would come under the NSIA coordination.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Federal Government had compensated those whose land was affected by the project, he said the compensation was ongoing and that significant sums had been paid already. Assessment is still being done for compensation but I can assure you that the directive we have from the President, the minister and our board is that adequate compensation is paid to everyone who is affected.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the project would be completed on schedule. \u201cApril 2 is a day we should remember because after this, in a few hours, people can drive through it. That marks the completion of the civil works; it remains the finishing touches,\u201d he added.\n\nThe deputy governor said he was excited about the work done so far as he called on the Federal Government to keep to the scheduled completion date.\n\nThe Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, said a few weeks ago that the project was 91 per cent completed and it would be inaugurated in October.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: Yahaya Bello targets raising 20m millionaires by 2030",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi on Saturday officially declared his intention to contest for the 2023 presidential election and promised to end poverty by raising 20 million millionaires by 2030.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Bello declared to run for President under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe said that economy, security, peace and unity would be his watchword as he works to create a nation where everyone is carried along regardless of religion or tribe.\n\nAccording to him, the slogan of his campaign is \u2018Hope, Bridging the Gap\u2019 because all he wants to do is bring hope to the nation while bridging the gaps in politics.\n\n\u201cA Yahaya Bello Presidency will have an additional target of creating at least 20 million millionaires by the same year 2030, with the aim that each of them will employ or otherwise empower at least five other citizens.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we are going to learn a lot from the South East.\n\n\u201cThe apprenticeship model by which a boy, from an indigent or affluent background, is taken, trained and turned into a millionaire businessman in as little as 10 years is one we have to understudy and invest in.\n\n\u201cHarvard University already studies it and the Nigerian Government must do no less.\n\n\u201cI have personally observed that this model works on average 50 per cent of the time with at least five out of 10 boys who apprenticed with various Igbo friends of mine are millionaires today in their own rights. \u2018\u2019\n\nBello said he had a vision of an open Nigerian government and economy, inclusive, honesty and managed to operate with a human face and transparent processes.\n\nBello promised to consolidate on the gains of President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that he would give more powers to governors over matters of security, public transportation, taxation, fiscal federalism, mineral and agro resources and electricity.\n\n\u201cThese are the legacies of Mr President, they will help the next president take longer and easier developmental strides, provided Nigerians make sure he is succeeded by one who is not out to discredit but to consolidate.\n\n\u201c I have proven time and time again that I am the only such successor in the APC\u2019s line-up for 2023.\n\n\u201cI am running for President because I see a bright light shining at the end of the tunnel for our nation. I am not one of those who only see doom and gloom.\n\n\u201c It is my intention to take custody of that light, to pierce the dark spots in our past and present with it, to illuminate every gap in our nationhood and to fix them.\n\n\u201cI will ensure that this light is handed over in due course to successors who will be trustworthy stewards of the great future which a federal government led by me will build for our nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nBello said that he worked hard as governor of Kogi and delivered on his mandate, urging Nigerians to check out his achievement on www.kogipedia.net which covered his work from 2016 until date.\n\n\u201cLet me itemise the most important qualities which I consider imperative in our next Commander-in-Chief, I invite Nigerians to rate all candidates by them if we want a country that will live up to our expectations come 2023.\n\n\u201cYouthfulness: Natural force and physical energy cannot be abated if performance is to be elevated. I am 46 and a half years old and by the grace of God, I am fit in all physical and mental faculties.\n\n\u201cCourage: A clear capacity to be zealously affected in a good matter and to lead with courage and foresight in the pursuit of the overall best interests of the people and the nation.\n\n\u201cSecurity: Proven ability to enforce Security, Unity and Peace in a large territory with difficult terrain. Citizens must be safe in their homes and assets.\n\n\u201cDiversity: Our next president must possess excellent records in successfully managing diversity. \u2018\u2019\n\nBello promised inclusivity, adding that Nigerians should be able to live and contribute anywhere in the nation with the guarantee that they would not be called strangers .\n\nHe said that his desire was to have every Nigerian, especially youths, to live in a country where tribe, religion or gender would be ever considered a \u2018minority\u2019 again, particularly by the things leaders do or fail to do in government.\n\nHe said that equity, fairness and justice must undergird government actions in the distribution of national resources and opportunities including the recruitment procedures of public entities.\n\nHe also promised as a president every Nigerian would become mentally and physically empowered with the unshakeable conviction and practical proof that they are not inferior to any other person for any reason.\n\nBello said that his presidency like his governorship, would be tough on crime, adding that Kogi went from being the state where violent crime was most endemic in 2015 to become one of the safest states in Nigeria from 2017 till date.\n\nHe therefore, said that terrorism, kidnapping, banditry and other violent crimes would not be tolerated when he becomes the President and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nHe promised to pursue a clearly defined strategy on broadening the footprint of new technology in the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said that he would set up a National Block Chain Taskforce (NBT) to develop a trailblazing policy for the nation in cryptos, the metaverse, NFTs and block chain technology.\n\n\u201cI am not running for President apologetically, but on a solid record of verifiable achievements in my current assignment as Governor of Kogi State.\n\n\u201c I have proven antecedents in the very areas that Nigerians crave for succour urgently, that is, Security, Unity and Progress. I would therefore say that I possess the academic qualifications and hands-on experience to be the Next Nigerian President on merit.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Chairman of the occasion, Salvador Moshood ,said that the Bello\u2019s declaration for president was hope for youths ,women and other marginalized groups.\n\nMoshood, therefore, urged them to give their support to Bello for a better Nigeria and garner more support from friends and family alike.\n\nThe National Coordinator, Sen. Jonathan Zwingina, said that Bello would continue with the good works of President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that although Bello is young but he has much to offer for a greater nation.\n\nAccording to Zwingina, Bello is a detribalised leader with no trace of ethnicity or religious difference as he works for the good of everyone and would replicate such in the larger country as president .\n\nDeputy Governor of Kogi, Edward Onoja, who reeled out a 10 point achievement of the Bello\u2019s administration in Kogi said that he was leaving a great legacy behind for the state.\n\nHe said that Bello disbanded criminal gangs, ending kidnapping and other social vices and insecurity, destroyed tribalism and religious differences and built a church in the state\u2019s government house after 28 years of not having one.\n\nHe said that he supported zoning of presidency but this time the zoning had to be in favour of youths, adding that it was time for people under 50 years to rule the nation .\n\nThe Director-General of GYB Campaign, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, said that women had been sidelined for decades and only been known in political activities as singer and cooks but Bello changed the narrative by making her the DG of his campaign team.\n\nAbiola-Costello said the nation was on the match to its true destiny with Bello, adding that women would build the nation and therefore, encouraged women and youths to support Bello because the takeover tie for them had come.(NAN)",

This is what Nigeria is missing, we need this kind vision in our Country, that will lift the unemployment rate in Nigeria, that will lift poverty, the people are hungry and there are no jobs, no investments, people are running away because of insecurity in the Country.\u201d\n\nThe Governor congratulated the Ikwerre Council Chairman for collaborating with the organizers to attract more investments into Rivers State, stressing that the State is the most secure State in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am telling all the investors now to come and do your businesses here you can never regret it. Rivers State is the most secured state in Nigeria today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe State Chief Executive who expressed the fact that the Urban renewal thrust of his Administration was on course, also said the growth, standard of living, and sustenance of the rural areas and our communities are being encouraged by his Government.\n\nHowever, the Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area, Engr.

Our nation is one gifted by Allah with bountiful resources and a good and decent people.\n\n\u201cYet, we also face serious and dangerous challenges because of a small few who know not the way of truth, love and goodness. These people have given themselves over to that which is bad and destructive.\n\n\u201cWe shall not be made despondent by the wrongs these people do. Instead, let us renew and strengthen our faith and trust in Almighty Allah and His great mercy towards us.\n\n\u201cDuring this holy month, may we fervently pray that we shall begin to overcome and defeat the chalk, which now confronts our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cWe beseech Almighty Allah to grant Nigeria special favour such that we become the just, prosperous and harmonious society He intends for us to be.\n\n\u201cThat each of us in our own humble way contributes to the wellbeing of those around us, give succour to people we find in need and study more how to solve problems instead of creating them.\n\n\u201cLet us pray that Munificent Allah answer the prayers of His faithful as the ultimate reward for their sacrifices this holy month and that Nigeria shall see the peace and prosperity that only can be fashioned by the kind hand of the Almighty Himself.\u201d",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said the remodeling of the National Arts Theatre will cost the Bankers\u2019 Committee $100 million at completion.\n\nHe spoke yesterday during the second inspection of progress of work at the National Arts Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos with the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed and Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare.\n\nEmefiele said foreign investors from different parts of the world, including the United States of America, has shown interest in the project as well as the creative industry.\n\n\u201cI am happy that foreign investors are already showing interest and I want to place it on record that we have received enquiries from the United States from investors who have said that they are interested in taking a look at not just the National Arts Theatre, but also the creative opportunities that we are developing around here,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele said Sanwo-Olu had opened the Bankers\u2019 Committee eyes to the opportunity present at the National Arts Theatre when the team was looking for possible area to site the project.\n\n\u201cI thank the governor of Lagos State because at the time we were looking for where this project would be sited, he opened our eyes on the need to take a look at this 44 hectare land that also includes the National Arts theatre.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do here is a total rejuvenation of Lagos State by really redeveloping this masterpiece right at the centre of Lagos that will be linked with the rail to ensure this project works,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubt, this project is costing the Bankers Committee, by last estimate, about $100 million, and I must say that yes, about $100 million or more will be invested in this project, but it is going to be business where the monies will be realised again,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cOur target is that by the special grace of God, Mr. President will commission the new National Arts Theatre by November. And we are hoping also that on the day he commissions the new National Arts Theatre, he will also lay the foundation for the four verticals: the music, the movie, IT as well as the fashion hub.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for information, every piece of land here, every structure that is going to be standing here will be standing on almost about 46-metre pile. So it is very, very extensive work, but we believe also that by the time the President is about bowing out by May next year, he would come again and now re-commission not just the National Theatre but the entire edifice comprising the four vertical hubs so that there will be immense business opportunities, enough of tourism, enough of creative sector businesses that will be generated not just for Nigeria but particularly for our youths who have shown a lot of creative talents and we think we need to use this opportunity to harness it,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, said the greatest beneficiary of this project apart from the generality of Nigerians are the youth who will benefit from the virtual spaces, the clusters that will come creative entertainment, among others.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said that a lot of work would have been done at the project site by the next inspection time of two months.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I want to express my appreciation to the CBN governor, the Bankers Committee that has made it possible for us to have enough finance and, of course, the governor of Lagos State because he is also providing the enabling environment in terms of rail transportation in terms of making use of the waterways.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that from what we have heard today, this will not be an abandoned project. This project will be commissioned before the end of this administration.\u201d\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said he was delighted at the commitment of the Bankers\u2019 Committee to the project\u2019s funding.\n\n\u201cWe are indeed very excited; excited because if we speak from now till next year, if there is no funding, regular and appropriate funding to back it up, we will probably just all be scratching our head.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of my entire millions of youths that are in Lagos, I want to sincerely through the CBN Governor thank the Bankers Committee.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cWhat all of this is about is still about creating that enabling environment. This whole project will not do everything. There is still going to be a whole lot more in the years ahead that people still need to do.\n\n\u201cBut we are breaking all of the barriers, breaking all of the challenges that we have and we are writing this sector, we are writing their names in gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis in itself can further help us to deepening our GDP as a state, as a nation and continue to de-emphasise oil as the only source of revenue that we have and we can begin to export all of the talents that will be coming out of this place to the rest of Africa and the world.\n\n\u201cThe only reward for good work is simply more work. We are stretching in ourselves to see November, December deadline. They are really stretchy numbers and we will be here again in another two to three months and I am believing that we will see further advancement and further deliverables that will continue to make that closure, that realisation possible,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "The Senator who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly, Comrade Shehu Sani, and the Coalition of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) in the state have joined other Nigerians in rejecting Governor Nasir El-Rufai\u2019s idea of hiring foreign mercenaries to fight terrorists in the Northwest.\n\nWhile Senator Shehu Sani said what the Northwest needs to defeat terrorism is a regional security outfit like the Southwest\u2019s Amotekun, the CNPP asked El-Rufai to resign, saying that he has failed to secure the lives and property of the people of his state.\n\nSenator Sani, in an interview with The Nation, said in addition to the regional security outfit which should be funded with the governor\u2019s security votes, they also need to hire a security consultant that would use technology to tackle bandits and terrorists.\n\nSani said: \u201cWe must acknowledge that we are in a desperate situation in Northwest Nigeria, and desperate situation calls for solutions from all angles.\n\n\u201cFrom every indication, the security establishments have failed to protest us. So, as far as human lives are concerned, whatever that can be done to restore peace and order should be done.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we need mercenaries to come and fight in the Northwest part of Nigeria. What is needed now is for the Northwestern state governors, including Niger State, to set up a regional security outfit which they will use their security votes to fund, just like the Southwest have done with Amotekun.\n\n\u201cThey also need to employ security a consultant that will use technology to tackle these bandits and terrorists. That would be better than bringing mercenaries who are simply going to work for a period of time and leave at the end of the day, because mercenaries cannot work forever in a situation like this.\n\n\u201cBut you can grow your own security outfit, fund them, equip them and give them the go ahead to fight these terrorists.\n\n\u201cAlso, their mandate must be clear; that they are to confront terrorists and bandits and they have no role politics.\n\n\u201cThey should be headed by a retired military or police man who has the expertise to function in such assignments.\n\n\u201cBut bringing foreign mercenaries? No. Only the Federal Government can do that; states cannot do that.\n\n\u201cWe also need to train our people on how to protect and defend their land.\n\n\u201cI think this is the best way to go about it, because I don\u2019t think the Federal Government will allow states to enter into foreign partnership with any organisation to come and defend our territory, except if we change the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCNPP in its own statement signed by the Kaduna State chapter Chairman, Alhaji Shehu Abubakar Birningwari, said: \u201cThe confession of Governor El-Rufai that he has failed the state and her people leaves him with no other option but resign to allow competent people take the state out of the daily killings El-Rufai has drawn the state into.\u201d\n\nBirningwari said Kaduna has become a state in perpetual mourning as citizens live in perpetual fear of kidnapping for ransom, abduction and killings daily.\n\nIn the statement, he explained that \u201cfor EL-RUFAI to have said he knows the camps of the terrorists, he knows where they are, he listens to their conversation and knows what they plan, is an indictment of a leader who should have proactively acted on such intelligence to save lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, who is an ally of EL-RUFAI, that \u2018first as leaders, they owe the victims and their relatives an apology as these unwarranted acts of violence are becoming too regular and they basically question their collective capacity to govern, is more than a pointer that Governor EL-RUFAI is an abysmal failure and resignation is his only option.\n\n\u201cThe unity of voice and stand of Christian Association of Nigeria CAN and Council of Imams and Ulamas Kaduna State chapters that \u2018on the contrary, the government and her intelligence gathering happens to be more about settling scores with perceived foes\u2019 and \u2018the government must be held responsible for every single soul that is lost\u201d are indictments of Governor El-Rufai.\u201d\n\nWhile sympathising with the families of those who lost loved ones in various attacks across the state and beyond, Abubakar Birningwari prays for quick recovery of those injured, calling on the government to wake up from its slumber and rescue those in captivity.",

          "text": "In Nigeria, being a charismatic politician doesn\u2019t save you from aspersion, verbal, written or physical. And a contemporary figure in the realm who best demonstrates the truth of this declaration is Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ex-Lagos State Governor who is now aiming to be the country\u2019s president in 2023. Since he spoke publicly of this ambition, to forsake his traditional role of a kingmaker and be the king himself, he has been pilloried from both expected and unexpected quarters.\n\nThere have arisen adversaries from within and from without. And the thrust of the naysayers is that the Jagaban of Borgu ought to remain forever as the one who prepares rulers for the royal court. While some question his moral credentials, others say his past as a governor should eminently fit him for a higher office. So it has been a roughshod ride of critical comments over the National Leader of the governing All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nBut turning 70 on March 29, 2022, Tinubu has silenced his traducers as he put up a performance that appeared to signal what would be the guiding principle of his administration if he finds his way into the nation\u2019s highest political office. When all things had been put in place for a heavily publicized colloquium to mark his septuagenarian milestone in Lagos, a national tragedy occurred involving a terrorist attack on a train heading to Kaduna from Abuja that took several lives, maimed many others and resulted in the kidnap of numerous citizens.\n\nThat was when Tinubu released the sensitive patriot and nationalist in him. Unmoved by the torrent of vituperations on him and the enormous financial and manpower expenses pumped into preparing for the colloquium, the former governor cancelled the program in order to honor the victims of the tragedy.\n\nHe said as he took the decision: \u201dToday is supposed to be a very joyful 70th birthday of mine\u2026I give thanks to God Almighty for being able to survive to this age. I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country\u2026that\u2026many were killed and bombed on a train between Kaduna and Abuja\u2026That is a very serious incident about the security of lives in this country and it calls for a very serious sober reflection. For me to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying myself doesn\u2019t show enough concern for a statesman and a senior citizen of this country. This event should not be held. I have consulted with the people\u2026and they\u2019ve agreed with me and being a highly committed democrat, I have given (in) to their suggestion that\u2026this event (colloquium) be cancelled.\u201d\n\nThe narrative on Tinubu changed hours after this move by the politician. A columnist with a leading newspaper known for its implacable dissenting stand on the Buhari government and those sympathetic to it said:..\u201dAnd here, one must commend Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who put off the celebration of his 70th birthday in respect of the victims of this sad event.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tinubu has faced a thousand and one travails in the long trajectory of his life as a politician, he has always triumphed. In 2004, following the seizure of nearly N33b Federal allocation fund belonging to Lagos State by the Obasanjo government over the creation of new local governments by Governor Tinubu, the world expected the state to collapse. However despite 14 months of travail the Tinubu administration underwent on account of the withheld fund, the government still recorded noticeable achievements.\n\nMuch earlier, we saw a Tinubu as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who would go into exile to join the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, to battle a savage military junta and save the soul of Nigeria. He threw his capital, experience and time into this patriotic enterprise. It was a hugely successful venture, because NADECO\u2019s exploits, clandestine and overt, eventually saw off the martial rule, whose exit brought the civilian dispensation where Tinubu became the governor of Lagos in 1999.",

          "title": "2023: Presenting Northern candidate against South will be war -Frank Kokori",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nChief Frank Kokori is a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). But just like other concerned Nigerians, he is worried about the festering security situation in the country especially the new wave of attacks on all means of transportation.\n\nIn this interview, he urged the Buhari administration to take a frank audit of its failings in the past six and half years with a view to addressing them frontally.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nHow would you react to the escalating security situation in Nigeria especially the recent attacks by bandits on Kaduna-bound trains?\n\nAll Nigerians are worried about the security situation in the country. And most of these security breaches are very embarrassing. For me, I think the security personnel are collaborating. Don\u2019t you see the kind of weapon those ragtag bandits are carrying? Can they match the ammunition available to the Nigerian army? So, it seems to me very shameful. There is no way we can march on like this among comity of nations. We have the biggest army in Africa and there is threat of insecurity here and there. So much money has been invested in the security of this country. When you compare it with GDP of other countries, it is one of the highest. But the people in charge of it, security, are collaborating. That is why you see some retired generals are billionaire. How can a star general even have millions in his account and several property? Is that not corruption? All these things are obvious, although some of them are extreme nationalists and patriots. Anyway, they are like other human beings. I know the temptations I faced during pro-democracy struggle in this country. I am an elder statesmen, I don\u2019t feel happy hearing some of these things. How can you imagine bandits carrying away over 200 school-children in one swoop and nobody will detect them for months. All this is a clear failure on the part of the government. In this digital age, a lot of things ought to be done.\n\nIn the face of all of this, the ruling APC and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been trading blames over an alleged plot to destabilize the country. How does it sound to you?\n\nNo responsible government will see people who want to destroy the country and fold its arms. Let nobody come and tell us this kind of rubbish. I am an APC man; they should leave the PDP out of this matter. The buck stops on the table of the Commander-in-Chief. Lai Muhammed should not come and tell us this kind of childish thing. If you know the people who want to destablise the country, you round them up. That is what we want to hear. Are we school children?\n\nThe three pronged agenda of this government is security, economy and anti-corruption. At this stock-taking period, how would you rate the performance of this administration based on these indices?\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nWe were in the forefront of the people who were supporting Buhari at that time. Even we in the Niger Delta did so at the risk of our lives because Goodluck Jonathan was in power then. But I felt Jonathan was a lame president. So, we thought Buhari was what he used to be in the early 80s, we thought he would do wonders. But since he came to power, Nigerians have been short-changed. He may be a good man, but he is tired. And he is one president you can\u2019t even reach except the cabal around him. I am a member of the moribund Board of Trustees of the APC, I can\u2019t reach him. He dictates the shot and everybody must follow. It is not that I am supporting the PDP; there is nothing in the PDP. In most countries, there is a two-party system. But APC can still spring surprises with a good presidential candidate and we know the people. The PDP too can spring up a good candidate that will work for the good of the country. That is why you can\u2019t write them off. The APC could be revolutionized. So, we cannot write off APC because of Buhari. The only thing is that Buhari is tired in terms of age, mental capacity and health. I am saying this because I am of the same age with him and I know what people like us pass through. Kokori of today is not the same Kokori of 70s and 80s. Even then, you can govern well with trust. The truth is that the bad ones among the Fulani are not being punished for the bad things they are doing. How can someone invade people\u2019s farm, destroy their farms, rape their women and go scot-free? Yet, you call the police and the police look the other way because they have order from the above. Rubbish! You don\u2019t run a country like that.\n\nWhat then do you see ahead as the country approaches the next general elections amidst this atmosphere of insecurity?\n\nWe will conduct elections smoothly if the INEC is serious with its preparations with the use of card readers. We will have good leaders as long as the parties present good candidates. APC can present a good man and change everything. The PDP can present a good man and change everything. Buhari had an image of a patriotic leader when he was younger, but now he is tired.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAPC\u2019s convention has come and gone. There is now a new National Working Committee to take charge of the affairs of the party. But there is still the hurdle of presidential primary. Do you see the possibility of the kind of consensus arrangement that happened during the convention?\n\nIf they can agree on consensus of a good person, good luck. For me, there should be real voting for presidential candidate. If you lose, it is your own headache. Buhari himself was elected as candidate by voting in 2014 at Teslim Balogun Stadium. He was in contention with Atiku and Kwankwaso. That time, I was a member of the BOT of APC and we did our best. We though Nigeria will change for the better, we never knew that the cabal would come and surround Buhari and be dictating the shots.\n\nCould you now say that APC is good to go especially with the new NWC?\n\nAPC has better candidates than the PDP, but the two parties have similar ideological leanings which is why it is easy for people to move from one party to the other. PDP too has good people. With a good leader from both parties, a lot of things will change. You can see what Tinubu and Fashola did in Lagos.\n\nIs that suggesting that you have preference for Tinubu as an APC candidate?\n\nTinubu is my friend, he is capable. The only thing is that it\u2019s long I saw him and I wouldn\u2019t know if his health can carry the burden of leadership. If he feels his health is good enough for it, then he is good to go.\n\nThe PDP appears to be at a loss on the issue of power shift to the South. How do you see the ongoing power play in the party especially with the gladiators in the North already in the race?\n\nIt is all greed. How can you have Buhari as Hausa/Fulani for eight years and then give power to the North again? Is there any sense in that? Nigeria is on a tripod and even with the minority as the fourth leg. The argument the PDP is putting up is a very stupid one. They are saying that Southerners have ruled more in PDP than the Northerners. What of 30-something years when the military was there? Babangida was there for eight years, have they forgotten that? Buhari was there as military head of state for two years, they have also forgotten that. Murtala Muhammed was there for six months, they have forgotten all that because Obasanjo ruled for eight years. My stand is that Nigeria is multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural and we should all respect that. Atiku has been contesting elections for decades. He is a good man, but he should allow other people to contest. They should leave it for the South. Both APC and PDP should pick their candidates from the South. We can\u2019t allow Hausa/Fulani to be there forever. What about the other people? What about the people of the Niger Delta who are suffering environmental degradation as a result of oil exploration? Nigeria has not developed to a level where we neglect ethic consideration. Nigeria is not a homogeneous nation. We should not pretend to be. There must be some considerations and sacrifices to make the country move forward.\n\nIt\u2019s like the party is afraid of the likes of Atiku who will not just let go?\n\nLet them go ahead to destroy their party. There are many good people from the North in the PDP just as there are good people in the South. Presenting a Northern candidate against the South will be like a war. It shouldn\u2019t be like that.",

And also, the significance of today is that the two ends of the bridge are being put together and this is the final phase of the work in truly competing the project and the finishing work of the bridge.\n\n\u201cSo technically, I can report to Mr President that I have seen where all the N157 billion has gone to. This is a project that is very dear to the President and it is designed to uplift the lives and livelihood of the people of the Southeast and other parts of the country and we do hope that when this project comes on stream, it will ease traffic, will enhance commercial activities and improve the lives of the people of the state.\n\n\u201cAnd also, I am happy to see the ladies I am seeing at the construction site, not all men. Julius Berger has brought some very unique innovations in the construction of this project and I want to on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria applaud the skills of the construction workers that have been working on this site,\u201d she said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nShe said that through the project, the Federal Government has been able to create about 20,000 jobs at the construction site.\n\nSpeaking on the funding structure of the project, the NSIA MD said that the Second Niger Bridge is one of the three projects being funded from the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund.\n\nThe other two projects are the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Road project and the Lagos-Ibadan express road project.\n\n\u201cThe PIDF is a special fund set up by PMB managed by the NSIA. The NSIA brought some of its own capital and the capital provided by FG and the capital from returned loot from Sani Abacha.\n\n\u201cSo, when you said PPP, it is the NSIA and the partnership of the Federal Government and NSIA is the one coordinating the fund from investors.\n\n\u201cSo, as it stands now, it is purely the NSIA and the Federal Government that is the face of the project today,\u201d Orji explained.\n\nWhen asked if those whose lands were affected by the project have been adequately compensated, Orji said a significant portion of the compensation has been settled by the government.\n\nHe said more assessment is still being made with a view to compensating those that will still be affected as the project progresses.\n\nOn whether the completion date is still feasible based on the progress of work done, the NSIA boss expressed optimism that the project will be completed on schedule.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen on ground is very important. April 2 for us marks the end of civil work of the bridge and we needed to leave here today.\n\n\u201cAnd as you can see, casting is going on at the moment. So, it\u2019s a very iconic period for us and it is unique because of the timing of the finance minister who came and witnessed it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Anambra deputy governor said that the state government is very excited about the pace of work done so far.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the projects that we are excited about.

          "text": "\n\n\u2022 As 21 are reported missing by relatives\n\n\n\nKasim Sumaina in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Saturday confirmed the safety of 170 passengers, even as it said that 21 passengers were still reported missing by the relatives who made calls to the corporation.\n\nNRC, in a release in Abuja by its Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, read: \u201cYou would recall that on the 28th of March, 2022, suspected bandits attacked the last evening train, AK9 on the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna Train Service with explosives, leading to the death of some passengers and destruction of the train and track.\n\n\u201cBecause of the level of damage on the track and in honour of those that lost their lives, the Corporation suspended train operations on the affected route.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okhiria, while in this mournful mood, it is also important to inform members of the public and the press about the latest development and what the corporation is doing to restore train services.\n\n\u201cThis update has become absolutely necessary so as to prevent the circulation of falsehood or misleading information to the general public.\n\n\u201cFor the records, there were eleven (11) coaches on the train worked by Loco 2502, which is made up of four (4) SPA Coaches with 56 sitting capacity per coach and 7 SP Coaches with 88 sitting capacity per coach.\n\n\u201cThus, the total seat capacity of the train is 840 seats. You may also recall that the train manifest contained 362 validated passengers aboard the train.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss hinted that the corporation, in continuation of its concerted effort through repeated calls, has been able to confirm the safety of \u201c170 passengers, while 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to us,\u201d Okhiria said.\n\nHe further said that the corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe corporation is also not resting on its oars as she has heavily moved human and material resources to the accident site to make sure that train services resumed without further delays in order to reduce the stress that our passengers are currently going through.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast.\n\n\u201cThere is a co-ordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja to the bomb blast site, another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. Restoration of track for full resumption of normal train services will continue today 2nd April 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said further in the statement, \u201cGentlemen of the press, it may also interest you to know that arrangements have equally been put in place for increased security along the track and on board the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cOnce again, our hearts go out to the families of those that lost their loved ones and that of those that are still missing.\u201d\n\nHe however assured Nigerians that the corporation is with the general public in this challenging time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari Meets El-Rufa\u2019i over Kaduna Train Attack",
          "text": "Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Friday in Abuja updated President Muhammadu Buhari on security developments in his state following the Monday night\u2019s terror attack on Abuja-Kaduna bound train.\n\nThe governor, who was sober about recent happenings in his state, told State House correspondents that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in Kaduna state and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, security agencies have been making frantic efforts to rescue victims of Monday night\u2019s attack on a Kaduna bound train, from the hands of their abductors.\n\nHe disclosed that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in the state and beyond.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i, who spoke in Hausa language, disclosed that the attack on the train was carried out by Boko Haram iinsurgents in collaboration with some bandits operating in Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto and Kebbi States.\n\n\u201cThe President assured me that necessary steps would be taken on the matter and this thing will be brought to an end in few months, and security agents are already carrying out surveillance around where these criminals are and, by the grace of God, they will be rounded up.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, the government will always take precautionary measures to safeguard the lives of citizens, therefore, except the victims are rescued unhurt, the airforce and ground troops will not be able to confront the criminals. So to avoid any colossal damage, the captives have to be freed first,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor confirmed that the gunmen had contacted families of their captives, but yet to request for ransom.\n\n\u201cWell, the families of those kidnapped have been contacted while some of the captives themselves have called their loved ones, saying they are doing well and they are being taken care of. But the gunmen have not shown any sign of collecting ransom,\u201d he added..\n\nEl-Rufai emphasised that the gunmen are not kidnappers but members of the Boko Haram terrorists group working in collaboration with bandits.\n\n\u201cThese ones are not the usual kidnappers but members of Boko who are collaborating with bandits.\n\n\u201dSo we were thinking they will ask for a huge ransom from the state government, not the families of their victims.\n\n\u201dSo far, they have asked for ransom from just one of the families that were contacted.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Kaduna state government is concerned, we have not changed our stand on payment of ransom, so, even if they seek for that from us, we will not pay because we are not ready to do so,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i revealed that the state government had received intelligence report that the gunmen were going to strike on the rail line and had intimated the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the matter, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cWe think this thing happened because we have written twice to the NRC, advising that trains on the Kaduna route should not embark on night trips because we have reports that Boko Haram were in town and they plan to attack the train at night using explosive devices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for massive bombing of all bandit-infected enclaves including forest areas in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna-bound train, which left Abuja at 6 p.m. on Monday, was attacked by suspected terrorists at about 7.45 p.m., just about 15 minutes\u2019 drive before Kaduna.\n\nEight persons had been officially confirmed dead, 46 hospitalised and several others kidnapped following the attack.

The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\n\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, yesterday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\n\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\n\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\n\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\n\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\n\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\n\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\n\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\n\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\n\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\n\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\n\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\n\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\n\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\n\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\n\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\n\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police yesterday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nThe market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\n\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\n\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\n\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "For the Chief Commander at 80",
          "text": "If only Ebenezer Obey\u2019s mum knew! When her son said he wanted to be a j\u00f9j\u00fa singer, Madam Abigail Oyindamola protested vehemently. \u201cIn our family, we don\u2019t sing people\u2019s praises. Instead, they sing our praises,\u201d the proud Egba woman reportedly told him. Not only did Obey go on to sing people\u2019s praises, his own praises were also sung everywhere as he reinvented j\u00f9j\u00fa music. But you have to admire the pride and self-assurance of the mother whose first husband had abandoned because of childlessness after 20 years of marriage, who picked up the pieces, went on to marry the carpenter she had engaged to build the roof of her house, and finally had Obey with the \u201caccidental\u201d husband.\n\nI grew up an omnivorous consumer of music, foreign and local. With no Spotify or YouTube, radio and record stores were the sources of free listening. But I had an extra luck: my father had a pile of vinyl records and a turntable. Years after his death in 1976, my grandmother (God rest her soul) handed them to me as my inheritance. Most of the albums were by Obey, clearly my dad\u2019s favourite artiste. King Sunny Ade (KSA) and Idowu Animashaun, both j\u00f9j\u00fa stars, accounted for three each. There were a dozen Jim Reeves and plenty other Christian albums (my father was an organist and choir master of the Immanuel Baptist Church, Ilorin). I acquired other musical tastes from my uncles.\n\nAs a little boy, I thought j\u00f9j\u00fa music was the genre for Christians and f\u00faj\u00ec for Muslims. F\u00faj\u00ec singers often recited the Qur\u2019an. Obey always sang Christian songs. I enjoyed both genres but had zero knowledge of their origins until much later in life. I particularly like the concise history of the evolution of f\u00faj\u00ec given by Akorede Babatunde Okunola aka Saidi Osupa. Quoting his father, who also sang f\u00faj\u00ec, Osupa said f\u00faj\u00ec\u2019s roots were in kiriboto, etiyeri, seli and w\u00e9r\u00e9. Instructively, w\u00e9r\u00e9 (ajis\u00e1\u00e0ri) was usually sung during Ramadan fasting to wake Muslims up for sah\u016br. W\u00e9r\u00e9 gave birth to awurebe. The late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister transformed awurebe into what he later named \u201cf\u00faj\u00ec\u201d.\n\nIt is striking that almost all f\u00faj\u00ec artistes are Muslims, with the notable exception of the late Sunny T Adesokan. He branded himself as \u201cOmo nna t\u2019onko f\u00faj\u00ec\u201d (\u201can Igbo guy singing f\u00faj\u00ec\u201d). The branding \u2014 helped by his unquestionable talent and ability to create street slangs \u2014 worked but the rumour in town was that he had a Yoruba father and an Ikwere mother. There are Christian gospel singers who adopt f\u00faj\u00ec as the vehicle to express their art, notably Adekunle Fuji, Midnight Crew and Adedoyin Adeotun aka Okiki Jesu Fuji, but it is still understood that they are gospel, not f\u00faj\u00ec, artistes. Every evidence points to the fact that f\u00faj\u00ec has its roots in Islam. The j\u00f9j\u00fa story is significantly different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJ\u00f9j\u00fa\u2019s origins are traced to Abdulrafiu Babatunde King, a Muslim, who started playing at Lagos clubs in the 1920s. His band members were known for throwing their instruments into the air and catching them \u2014 a spectacle that drew crowds to their shows. The highlife-influenced genre, heavy on percussions and folklores, became known as \u201cjij\u00fa\u201d or \u201cj\u00f9j\u00fa\u201d \u2014 the unedited Yoruba word for \u201cthrow throw\u201d (not to be confused with the juju that means magic). Many j\u00f9j\u00fa greats \u2014 Fatai Rolling-Dollar, Ayinde Bakare, YK Ajao and Ahuja Bello \u2014 were Muslims. Yet, as time rolled by, j\u00f9j\u00fa somehow became dominated by Christian acts, often featuring traditional church hymns and songs.\n\nObey, born Ebenezer Remilekun Aremu Olasupo Fabiyi, played a defining role in this. Following in the styles of the legendary IK Dairo and Rolling Dollar, his mentor, Obey would take j\u00f9j\u00fa to another level, infusing elements such as bass guitar and talking drums \u2014 along with guitar solos/interludes \u2014 to create a dancefloor flavour he called \u201cj\u00f9j\u00fa miliki\u201d. In all his melodies, you would not miss this thread: his lyrical content was built on a moral \u2014 in fact, Christian \u2014 message, burnished and garnished with axioms and prayers. He hardly sexualised women, unlike KSA, his friend and rival. KSA was the king of lewd lyrics. As kids, we could not sing some of KSA\u2019s songs in front of our elders.\n\nApart from lyrical decency, there were many things I admired in Obey. Unlike the trend these days whereby some successful artistes claim to be \u201cself-made\u201d and \u201cowe nobody nothing\u201d, Obey paid due homage to j\u00f9j\u00fa greats that came before him. In \u2018Oro Seniwo\u2019, released in 1969, he sang in Yoruba: \u201cThose who came before us/We need to give them their respect/Young people, don\u2019t be arrogant/Arrogance will take you nowhere.\u201d He went on to pay glowing tributes to IK Dairo, Ernest Olatunde Thomas (better known as Tunde Nightingale), Ayinde Bakare and Adeolu Akinsanya (Baba Eto), mentioning them by name, and including the names of their children \u2014 as was his custom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also loved the fact the he was a believer in one Nigeria and sang a number of songs promoting peace and unity during and after the Civil War of 1967-1970. He often sang songs that spoke to current affairs. I recall an album he released in 1980, I think, in which he sang \u201cI am proud to be a Nigerian\u201d (in English) and went on to name every state and governor. I was in primary school and it helped my knowledge of Nigeria. He sang about President Shehu Shagari\u2019s \u201causterity measure\u201d in 1983 which brought much hardship on Nigerians, as well as the 0-1-0 eating formula (no breakfast, no dinner) that came with Gen Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s structural adjustment programme (SAP).\n\nYoruba artistes are known for praise-singing movers and shakers, particularly the business tycoons and socialites. It was, and still is, a major source of their income \u2014 beyond royalties and shows. It was something Obey did very well, even though he did not pioneer it. It served a purpose for him but it also served a purpose for me \u2014 it was through his songs that I got to know big names such as MKO Abiola, Alao Arisekola, Bode Osinusi, Victor Odofin, Lanre Badmus and Kuburat Kadijat Bisi Edioseri (\u201cCash Madam\u201d) while growing up. His tributes to Badmus, Osinusi, Odofin and the Amojes rank among my favourites in the plethora of praise-singing hits that he churned out steadily.\n\nApparently, he was not always commissioned to sing those praises. For instance, the song for the Amoje family (\u2018Eje ka re\u2019le Amoje/Edakun eniso l\u2019Awe\u2019) in 1975 caught them unawares. Olayiwola, one of the sons of Chief Anthony Amoje, told Akinsanmi Ogunsumi, an Obey fan, in 2008: \u201cMy dad asked me where I got the money to give Obey to sing my praises when I know that he is a very private person. I said I didn\u2019t give him a kobo. Fortunately for me, I escaped further scolding when Obey also mentioned my dad\u2019s name. My father couldn\u2019t talk again. He bought a dozen of the album that day.\u201d Obey was rewarded: he became the family\u2019s official artiste for their social outings.\n\nEven \u201cCash Madam\u201d was taken unawares by the song. Edioseri said her real nickname was \u201cCash Woman\u201d because she was a distributor of major household brands and often took lorryloads of cash to the bank at the close of business. The cashiers started calling her \u201cCash Woman\u201d. Yusuf Olatunji aka Baba L\u2019Egba, the late s\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e0 music legend, also sang her praises in \u2018Yegede\u2019. He called her \u201cCash Woman\u201d. She had saved Baba L\u2019Egba from a certain amputation by picking the hospital bills. But Obey did not know her well enough and called her \u201cCash Madam\u201d (\u2018B\u2019ere ba d\u2019ere ebami pe Bisi o k\u2019owajo\u2019) in his evergreen album, \u2018Board Members\u2019, released in 1972. \u201cCash Madam\u201d stuck forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFair play to Obey: he sang the praises of his band members as well, not just the socialites. He valued family ties, often mentioning the names of their wives and children. He praised Samson Ogunlade (\u201cOko Mulikatu, Baba Ejire\u201d \u2014 \u201cMulikatu\u2019s husband, father of twins\u201d), who was the pioneer captain of the International Brothers band which Obey founded in 1964 and renamed Inter-Reformers in 1973; Mutiu \u201cKekere\u201d Jimoh (\u201cBaba Nurudeen, Oko Fausa\u201d); Oke Aminu (\u201cBaba Dupe\u201d), who died in a bike accident in 1972; Giwa Ojo Arigidi (\u201cBaba Toyin\u201d); Monday John (\u201cBaba Femi\u201d), the Edo-born guitar genius; Gabriel Adedeji (\u201cOko Wosila\u201d); Vasco Da Gama (\u201cOko Amoke, Baba Taju\u201d); and so on.\n\nObey dominated the j\u00f9j\u00fa circuit in the 1970s, frequently going on foreign tours, releasing hits upon hits, sometimes three in a year. While some were singles (or 45rpm, as they called it), most were full albums (long playing, or LP) with eight tracks. But in the 1980s, Obey had to start sharing the limelight with KSA, who had the edge of being on a global label, UK\u2019s Island Records, had access to the best recording facilities in the world and got better global marketing exposure \u2014 all complementing his exceptional vocal talent and wizardry on the lead guitar. KSA\u2019s \u2018Synchro System\u2019 would be nominated for a Grammy in 1982 \u2014 the first Nigerian to be so honoured. It was some feat.\n\nTill the early 1990s, Obey stuck to his moral messaging. It was his unique selling point. While this did not engage the youth as much as KSA\u2019s raunchy \u201csamba\u201d tunes and street slangs, Obey was still the top choice of the sober-minded j\u00f9j\u00fa lovers and those with ecclesiastical sentiments. It was just a matter of time for him to switch completely to gospel music and full-time ministry. It finally happened on his 50th birthday in 1992 when he was ordained an evangelist by the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa, a pioneer of charismatic Christianity in Nigeria. Obey thereafter founded Decross Gospel Mission. He was the general overseer until 2018 when he handed over to his son, Folarin.\n\nHis entry into music mirrored the personality of his self-assured mother. He famously trekked kilometres to the office of Decca Records on Lagos Island in 1964 and demanded to see the MD, calling himself \u201ca future star\u201d. His audacity and tenacity paid off: after much resistance from the secretary, he met the boss, a Briton named Mr Cress who was so impressed with Obey\u2019s confidence that he personally booked 25 copies of the debut, \u2018Ewo Ohun Oju Ri Laye\u2019. This helped the 22-year-old multi-instrumentalist reach, and even surpass, the threshold of a minimum of 500 pre-orders required to sign him on. Need we discuss what happened next? The future star became a superstar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe would later partner with Abiola to buy Decca West Africa Ltd from the British owners under the indigenisation programme of the 1970s. You should know Abiola: the man who won the June 12, 1993 presidential election that was annulled, resulting in a protracted political crisis. He was arrested and detained, never to return alive. He and Obey were buddies. Both were Egba \u2014 Obey was from Owu, Abiola from Gbagura. Obey sang his praises in a couple of records. Abiola himself was not a stranger to music: as a kid, he sang w\u00e9r\u00e9 to wake up fellow Muslims for sah\u016br. As a teenager, he had a band, making some coins to cater for his family and to also pay for his education.\n\nObey was a true mentor. When YK Ajao came on the j\u00f9j\u00fa scene, he sounded like Obey in an attempt to play in his class. But it was not working for him. \u201cWe later discovered that we were opening the market further for him even though he was [already] a leading j\u00f9j\u00fa musician. Owing to that, we were not known. And each time we performed, most people mistook us for Ebenezer Obey,\u201d Ajao told an interviewer years ago. Obey called and counselled him: \u201cYK, I want you to blend your music so that anytime someone hears you on radio, television or stage, he could easily say this is YK playing and not Ebenezer Obey.\u201d Ajao came up with j\u00f9j\u00fa makossa and began to have a slice of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Obey counselled Ajao from experience. When he too started out, he sounded much like IK Dairo. I am ashamed to admit that it took me decades to realise it was Obey that sang \u2018Olomi Gbo T\u2019emi\u2019. I thought it was IK Dairo. Well, it was not in my dad\u2019s collection, so I only heard it on radio. Songs like \u2018Gbebe Mi Oluwa\u2019 and \u2018Ore Mi Maje Aja\u2019 also misled me into thinking I was listening to IK Dairo without the accordion. It was when I bought a collection of Obey\u2019s works dating to the 1960s that I got to understand that I had been mixing them up. He too had probably realised the similarity and created his own j\u00f9j\u00fa brand. His trajectory was never the same again. He soared like an eagle.\n\nFor all his talent, though, Obey was not the best dancer in town. It might have had something to do with his physique. You were more likely to see him tilt a little to the right and a little to the left on the same spot. He was also not big on the high pitch \u2014 there were a few instances his voice actually broke (not everybody can be Michael Jackson or Pharrell Williams, right? Fela\u2019s attempts at high pitch were actually atrocious). What\u2019s more, Obey always preached family values, and I was unable to reconcile that with the fact that he had children out of wedlock. The best of us are still human beings after all. Something always has to give in the kingdom of stardom. That\u2019s the way life goes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan I name my best Obey album? Not really. As a young man, the philosophy at the heart of the album, \u2018The Horse, the Man and His Son\u2019, certainly taught me not to care too much about people\u2019s judgment of me. It was the story of a man and his son who travelled with a donkey. People criticised them all the way \u2014 when the man sat on the donkey alone, when it was only his son sitting on the donkey, when both of them sat on it and when neither sat on it. You cannot please everybody. That message helps me deal with acidic criticism till today. But Obey also sang plenty wisdom and made enchanting melodies across many albums that I find it quite hard to point to one as my favourite.\n\nAs the \u201cChief Commander\u201d clocks 80 today, he will surely miss his wife for 48 years. He married nee Juliana Olaide Olufade in 1963. She died in August 2011, aged 67. His promise to remarry is still pending. Overall, he has lived long and outlived many of his contemporaries. I doubt any member of his first band is still alive. Some died in recent years. John died in London in 2012. The velvet-voiced Arigidi (I just love his distinct harmony), the oldest surviving member, went home in 2019. Jimoh, the talking drummer, died in 2020. Notably, Obey always prayed for long life. It was an unmissable constant in his songs. His prayers were answered. Happy birthday, Oko Juliana, Baba Oluwashina.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nRAIL ATTACK\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night did not take me by surprise. The terrorists already served a warning by attacking the train in October 2021, but this was downplayed. It was a warning shot, so to say. There is a big issue of how to secure the rail but until we are able to root out or contain terrorism itself, we must contain the opportunistic bloodletting. Ironically, terrorists kill or kidnap villagers every day and we have come to accept it as a way of life. We read the headlines and move on. It takes something unusual, like the attack on the Kaduna train, to get a sense of outrage out of us. Otherwise, we are generally numb. Depressing.\n\nTWITTER TROLLS\n\nAt 9.43pm on Monday night, a young medical doctor named Chinelo Nwando tweeted in distress: \u201cI\u2019m in the train. I have been shot! Please pray for me.\u201d She was on the ill-fated Abuja-Kaduna train. While some sincerely worried for her safety and prayed that she would get help, some Twitter lords who get high saying vile things began trolling her. Some even questioned the genuineness of the incident. The most heartless tweet should be the one by someone who asked sarcastically: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d By that time, she was dead. I hope the trolls are very proud of themselves now. The blue app seems to encourage a race to the bottom \u2014 like, who can say the vilest things? Sickening.\n\nIFE FIASCO\n\nThe Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, has been in the news for the wrong reasons as the school tries to appoint a vice chancellor. The next VC must be from Ile-Ife, the \u201chost\u201d community has said, and they have been displaying all kinds of ancient tactics to enforce their demand. In the year 2022, human beings are still wearing charms and carrying calabash as \u201cspiritual\u201d tactics. This is a federal university: owned by Nigeria, not Osun state. This is an institution where scholarship is supposed to be the key, not contracts or appointments. The top candidates are Yoruba, not Fulani or Igbo. I am really anxious to see how Republic of Oodua will turn out when it is founded. Disgraceful.\n\nFEEBLE EAGLES\n\nI don\u2019t know what saddened me the most \u2014 the failure of the Super Eagles to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup or the rampage that ensued after the match, ruining the newly renovated stadium.

          "text": "If only Ebenezer Obey\u2019s mum knew! When her son said he wanted to be a j\u00f9j\u00fa singer, Madam Abigail Oyindamola protested vehemently. \u201cIn our family, we don\u2019t sing people\u2019s praises. Instead, they sing our praises,\u201d the proud Egba woman reportedly told him. Not only did Obey go on to sing people\u2019s praises, his own praises were also sung everywhere as he reinvented j\u00f9j\u00fa music. But you have to admire the pride and self-assurance of the mother whose first husband had abandoned because of childlessness after 20 years of marriage, who picked up the pieces, went on to marry the carpenter she had engaged to build the roof of her house, and finally had Obey with the \u201caccidental\u201d husband.\n\nI grew up an omnivorous consumer of music, foreign and local. With no Spotify or YouTube, radio and record stores were the sources of free listening. But I had an extra luck: my father had a pile of vinyl records and a turntable. Years after his death in 1976, my grandmother (God rest her soul) handed them to me as my inheritance. Most of the albums were by Obey, clearly my dad\u2019s favourite artiste. King Sunny Ade (KSA) and Idowu Animashaun, both j\u00f9j\u00fa stars, accounted for three each. There were a dozen Jim Reeves and plenty other Christian albums (my father was an organist and choir master of the Immanuel Baptist Church, Ilorin). I acquired other musical tastes from my uncles.\n\nAs a little boy, I thought j\u00f9j\u00fa music was the genre for Christians and f\u00faj\u00ec for Muslims. F\u00faj\u00ec singers often recited the Qur\u2019an. Obey always sang Christian songs. I enjoyed both genres but had zero knowledge of their origins until much later in life. I particularly like the concise history of the evolution of f\u00faj\u00ec given by Akorede Babatunde Okunola aka Saidi Osupa. Quoting his father, who also sang f\u00faj\u00ec, Osupa said f\u00faj\u00ec\u2019s roots were in kiriboto, etiyeri, seli and w\u00e9r\u00e9. Instructively, w\u00e9r\u00e9 (ajis\u00e1\u00e0ri) was usually sung during Ramadan fasting to wake Muslims up for sah\u016br. W\u00e9r\u00e9 gave birth to awurebe. The late Sikiru Ayinde Barrister transformed awurebe into what he later named \u201cf\u00faj\u00ec\u201d.\n\nIt is striking that almost all f\u00faj\u00ec artistes are Muslims, with the notable exception of the late Sunny T Adesokan. He branded himself as \u201cOmo nna t\u2019onko f\u00faj\u00ec\u201d (\u201can Igbo guy singing f\u00faj\u00ec\u201d). The branding \u2014 helped by his unquestionable talent and ability to create street slangs \u2014 worked but the rumour in town was that he had a Yoruba father and an Ikwere mother. There are Christian gospel singers who adopt f\u00faj\u00ec as the vehicle to express their art, notably Adekunle Fuji, Midnight Crew and Adedoyin Adeotun aka Okiki Jesu Fuji, but it is still understood that they are gospel, not f\u00faj\u00ec, artistes. Every evidence points to the fact that f\u00faj\u00ec has its roots in Islam. The j\u00f9j\u00fa story is significantly different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJ\u00f9j\u00fa\u2019s origins are traced to Abdulrafiu Babatunde King, a Muslim, who started playing at Lagos clubs in the 1920s. His band members were known for throwing their instruments into the air and catching them \u2014 a spectacle that drew crowds to their shows. The highlife-influenced genre, heavy on percussions and folklores, became known as \u201cjij\u00fa\u201d or \u201cj\u00f9j\u00fa\u201d \u2014 the unedited Yoruba word for \u201cthrow throw\u201d (not to be confused with the juju that means magic). Many j\u00f9j\u00fa greats \u2014 Fatai Rolling-Dollar, Ayinde Bakare, YK Ajao and Ahuja Bello \u2014 were Muslims. Yet, as time rolled by, j\u00f9j\u00fa somehow became dominated by Christian acts, often featuring traditional church hymns and songs.\n\nObey, born Ebenezer Remilekun Aremu Olasupo Fabiyi, played a defining role in this. Following in the styles of the legendary IK Dairo and Rolling Dollar, his mentor, Obey would take j\u00f9j\u00fa to another level, infusing elements such as bass guitar and talking drums \u2014 along with guitar solos/interludes \u2014 to create a dancefloor flavour he called \u201cj\u00f9j\u00fa miliki\u201d. In all his melodies, you would not miss this thread: his lyrical content was built on a moral \u2014 in fact, Christian \u2014 message, burnished and garnished with axioms and prayers. He hardly sexualised women, unlike KSA, his friend and rival. KSA was the king of lewd lyrics. As kids, we could not sing some of KSA\u2019s songs in front of our elders.\n\nApart from lyrical decency, there were many things I admired in Obey. Unlike the trend these days whereby some successful artistes claim to be \u201cself-made\u201d and \u201cowe nobody nothing\u201d, Obey paid due homage to j\u00f9j\u00fa greats that came before him. In \u2018Oro Seniwo\u2019, released in 1969, he sang in Yoruba: \u201cThose who came before us/We need to give them their respect/Young people, don\u2019t be arrogant/Arrogance will take you nowhere.\u201d He went on to pay glowing tributes to IK Dairo, Ernest Olatunde Thomas (better known as Tunde Nightingale), Ayinde Bakare and Adeolu Akinsanya (Baba Eto), mentioning them by name, and including the names of their children \u2014 as was his custom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also loved the fact the he was a believer in one Nigeria and sang a number of songs promoting peace and unity during and after the Civil War of 1967-1970. He often sang songs that spoke to current affairs. I recall an album he released in 1980, I think, in which he sang \u201cI am proud to be a Nigerian\u201d (in English) and went on to name every state and governor. I was in primary school and it helped my knowledge of Nigeria. He sang about President Shehu Shagari\u2019s \u201causterity measure\u201d in 1983 which brought much hardship on Nigerians, as well as the 0-1-0 eating formula (no breakfast, no dinner) that came with Gen Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s structural adjustment programme (SAP).\n\nYoruba artistes are known for praise-singing movers and shakers, particularly the business tycoons and socialites. It was, and still is, a major source of their income \u2014 beyond royalties and shows. It was something Obey did very well, even though he did not pioneer it. It served a purpose for him but it also served a purpose for me \u2014 it was through his songs that I got to know big names such as MKO Abiola, Alao Arisekola, Bode Osinusi, Victor Odofin, Lanre Badmus and Kuburat Kadijat Bisi Edioseri (\u201cCash Madam\u201d) while growing up. His tributes to Badmus, Osinusi, Odofin and the Amojes rank among my favourites in the plethora of praise-singing hits that he churned out steadily.\n\nApparently, he was not always commissioned to sing those praises. For instance, the song for the Amoje family (\u2018Eje ka re\u2019le Amoje/Edakun eniso l\u2019Awe\u2019) in 1975 caught them unawares. Olayiwola, one of the sons of Chief Anthony Amoje, told Akinsanmi Ogunsumi, an Obey fan, in 2008: \u201cMy dad asked me where I got the money to give Obey to sing my praises when I know that he is a very private person. I said I didn\u2019t give him a kobo. Fortunately for me, I escaped further scolding when Obey also mentioned my dad\u2019s name. My father couldn\u2019t talk again. He bought a dozen of the album that day.\u201d Obey was rewarded: he became the family\u2019s official artiste for their social outings.\n\nEven \u201cCash Madam\u201d was taken unawares by the song. Edioseri said her real nickname was \u201cCash Woman\u201d because she was a distributor of major household brands and often took lorryloads of cash to the bank at the close of business. The cashiers started calling her \u201cCash Woman\u201d. Yusuf Olatunji aka Baba L\u2019Egba, the late s\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e0 music legend, also sang her praises in \u2018Yegede\u2019. He called her \u201cCash Woman\u201d. She had saved Baba L\u2019Egba from a certain amputation by picking the hospital bills. But Obey did not know her well enough and called her \u201cCash Madam\u201d (\u2018B\u2019ere ba d\u2019ere ebami pe Bisi o k\u2019owajo\u2019) in his evergreen album, \u2018Board Members\u2019, released in 1972. \u201cCash Madam\u201d stuck forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFair play to Obey: he sang the praises of his band members as well, not just the socialites. He valued family ties, often mentioning the names of their wives and children. He praised Samson Ogunlade (\u201cOko Mulikatu, Baba Ejire\u201d \u2014 \u201cMulikatu\u2019s husband, father of twins\u201d), who was the pioneer captain of the International Brothers band which Obey founded in 1964 and renamed Inter-Reformers in 1973; Mutiu \u201cKekere\u201d Jimoh (\u201cBaba Nurudeen, Oko Fausa\u201d); Oke Aminu (\u201cBaba Dupe\u201d), who died in a bike accident in 1972; Giwa Ojo Arigidi (\u201cBaba Toyin\u201d); Monday John (\u201cBaba Femi\u201d), the Edo-born guitar genius; Gabriel Adedeji (\u201cOko Wosila\u201d); Vasco Da Gama (\u201cOko Amoke, Baba Taju\u201d); and so on.\n\nObey dominated the j\u00f9j\u00fa circuit in the 1970s, frequently going on foreign tours, releasing hits upon hits, sometimes three in a year. While some were singles (or 45rpm, as they called it), most were full albums (long playing, or LP) with eight tracks. But in the 1980s, Obey had to start sharing the limelight with KSA, who had the edge of being on a global label, UK\u2019s Island Records, had access to the best recording facilities in the world and got better global marketing exposure \u2014 all complementing his exceptional vocal talent and wizardry on the lead guitar. KSA\u2019s \u2018Synchro System\u2019 would be nominated for a Grammy in 1982 \u2014 the first Nigerian to be so honoured. It was some feat.\n\nTill the early 1990s, Obey stuck to his moral messaging. It was his unique selling point. While this did not engage the youth as much as KSA\u2019s raunchy \u201csamba\u201d tunes and street slangs, Obey was still the top choice of the sober-minded j\u00f9j\u00fa lovers and those with ecclesiastical sentiments. It was just a matter of time for him to switch completely to gospel music and full-time ministry. It finally happened on his 50th birthday in 1992 when he was ordained an evangelist by the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa, a pioneer of charismatic Christianity in Nigeria. Obey thereafter founded Decross Gospel Mission. He was the general overseer until 2018 when he handed over to his son, Folarin.\n\nHis entry into music mirrored the personality of his self-assured mother. He famously trekked kilometres to the office of Decca Records on Lagos Island in 1964 and demanded to see the MD, calling himself \u201ca future star\u201d. His audacity and tenacity paid off: after much resistance from the secretary, he met the boss, a Briton named Mr Cress who was so impressed with Obey\u2019s confidence that he personally booked 25 copies of the debut, \u2018Ewo Ohun Oju Ri Laye\u2019. This helped the 22-year-old multi-instrumentalist reach, and even surpass, the threshold of a minimum of 500 pre-orders required to sign him on. Need we discuss what happened next? The future star became a superstar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe would later partner with Abiola to buy Decca West Africa Ltd from the British owners under the indigenisation programme of the 1970s. You should know Abiola: the man who won the June 12, 1993 presidential election that was annulled, resulting in a protracted political crisis. He was arrested and detained, never to return alive. He and Obey were buddies. Both were Egba \u2014 Obey was from Owu, Abiola from Gbagura. Obey sang his praises in a couple of records. Abiola himself was not a stranger to music: as a kid, he sang w\u00e9r\u00e9 to wake up fellow Muslims for sah\u016br. As a teenager, he had a band, making some coins to cater for his family and to also pay for his education.\n\nObey was a true mentor. When YK Ajao came on the j\u00f9j\u00fa scene, he sounded like Obey in an attempt to play in his class. But it was not working for him. \u201cWe later discovered that we were opening the market further for him even though he was [already] a leading j\u00f9j\u00fa musician. Owing to that, we were not known. And each time we performed, most people mistook us for Ebenezer Obey,\u201d Ajao told an interviewer years ago. Obey called and counselled him: \u201cYK, I want you to blend your music so that anytime someone hears you on radio, television or stage, he could easily say this is YK playing and not Ebenezer Obey.\u201d Ajao came up with j\u00f9j\u00fa makossa and began to have a slice of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe Obey counselled Ajao from experience. When he too started out, he sounded much like IK Dairo. I am ashamed to admit that it took me decades to realise it was Obey that sang \u2018Olomi Gbo T\u2019emi\u2019. I thought it was IK Dairo. Well, it was not in my dad\u2019s collection, so I only heard it on radio. Songs like \u2018Gbebe Mi Oluwa\u2019 and \u2018Ore Mi Maje Aja\u2019 also misled me into thinking I was listening to IK Dairo without the accordion. It was when I bought a collection of Obey\u2019s works dating to the 1960s that I got to understand that I had been mixing them up. He too had probably realised the similarity and created his own j\u00f9j\u00fa brand. His trajectory was never the same again. He soared like an eagle.\n\nFor all his talent, though, Obey was not the best dancer in town. It might have had something to do with his physique. You were more likely to see him tilt a little to the right and a little to the left on the same spot. He was also not big on the high pitch \u2014 there were a few instances his voice actually broke (not everybody can be Michael Jackson or Pharrell Williams, right? Fela\u2019s attempts at high pitch were actually atrocious). What\u2019s more, Obey always preached family values, and I was unable to reconcile that with the fact that he had children out of wedlock. The best of us are still human beings after all. Something always has to give in the kingdom of stardom. That\u2019s the way life goes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan I name my best Obey album? Not really. As a young man, the philosophy at the heart of the album, \u2018The Horse, the Man and His Son\u2019, certainly taught me not to care too much about people\u2019s judgment of me. It was the story of a man and his son who travelled with a donkey. People criticised them all the way \u2014 when the man sat on the donkey alone, when it was only his son sitting on the donkey, when both of them sat on it and when neither sat on it. You cannot please everybody. That message helps me deal with acidic criticism till today. But Obey also sang plenty wisdom and made enchanting melodies across many albums that I find it quite hard to point to one as my favourite.\n\nAs the \u201cChief Commander\u201d clocks 80 today, he will surely miss his wife for 48 years. He married nee Juliana Olaide Olufade in 1963. She died in August 2011, aged 67. His promise to remarry is still pending. Overall, he has lived long and outlived many of his contemporaries. I doubt any member of his first band is still alive. Some died in recent years. John died in London in 2012. The velvet-voiced Arigidi (I just love his distinct harmony), the oldest surviving member, went home in 2019. Jimoh, the talking drummer, died in 2020. Notably, Obey always prayed for long life. It was an unmissable constant in his songs. His prayers were answered. Happy birthday, Oko Juliana, Baba Oluwashina.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nRAIL ATTACK\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday night did not take me by surprise. The terrorists already served a warning by attacking the train in October 2021, but this was downplayed. It was a warning shot, so to say. There is a big issue of how to secure the rail but until we are able to root out or contain terrorism itself, we must contain the opportunistic bloodletting. Ironically, terrorists kill or kidnap villagers every day and we have come to accept it as a way of life. We read the headlines and move on. It takes something unusual, like the attack on the Kaduna train, to get a sense of outrage out of us. Otherwise, we are generally numb. Depressing.\n\nTWITTER TROLLS\n\nAt 9.43pm on Monday night, a young medical doctor named Chinelo Nwando tweeted in distress: \u201cI\u2019m in the train. I have been shot! Please pray for me.\u201d She was on the ill-fated Abuja-Kaduna train. While some sincerely worried for her safety and prayed that she would get help, some Twitter lords who get high saying vile things began trolling her. Some even questioned the genuineness of the incident. The most heartless tweet should be the one by someone who asked sarcastically: \u201cAre you dead?\u201d By that time, she was dead. I hope the trolls are very proud of themselves now. The blue app seems to encourage a race to the bottom \u2014 like, who can say the vilest things? Sickening.\n\nIFE FIASCO\n\nThe Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, has been in the news for the wrong reasons as the school tries to appoint a vice chancellor. The next VC must be from Ile-Ife, the \u201chost\u201d community has said, and they have been displaying all kinds of ancient tactics to enforce their demand. In the year 2022, human beings are still wearing charms and carrying calabash as \u201cspiritual\u201d tactics. This is a federal university: owned by Nigeria, not Osun state. This is an institution where scholarship is supposed to be the key, not contracts or appointments. The top candidates are Yoruba, not Fulani or Igbo. I am really anxious to see how Republic of Oodua will turn out when it is founded. Disgraceful.\n\nFEEBLE EAGLES\n\nI don\u2019t know what saddened me the most \u2014 the failure of the Super Eagles to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup or the rampage that ensued after the match, ruining the newly renovated stadium. There is no doubt that we have a bunch of brilliant individual talents. The Black Stars of Ghana were just content to surrender possession to us and see out the match \u2014 after all, we were the ones that needed to break them down for the vital goal. We couldn\u2019t find a way. That was the job of the bench. The rampage thereafter tells me something: some people are just waiting for a little disorder anywhere to vent their pent-up frustration. That reminded me too much of the EndSARS riots. Scary.",

Everyone knows it\u2019s there, but no one wants to acknowledge it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the thing about elephants is that they can\u2019t be ignored for too long, they will move, and when they move, we will be forced to confront them.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait to be forced to take action. Actions that are taken under pressure and without due consultation often fail to accomplish desired objectives. And so, it is high time the twin issues of resource control and state police are subjected to robust debate at the legislature.\n\n\u201cI believe that any assembly that puts those two issues up for rigorous debate and gives Nigerians a fair deal on all counts will go down in history as the best assembly ever. If you read the pulse of the nation, you will see that everyone is tired of the status quo, and they are ready for new vistas.\n\n\u201cNigerians are demanding that their governors play the role of chief security officers of their states. They are asking that the governors be empowered to run the security architecture of their states.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor said the south-west governors responded to their people\u2019s clamour through the formation of Amotekun Corps, a western Nigeria security network, which he said has provided assistance to the people.\n\nOn the issue of resource control, the governor said: \u201cThere is an ongoing national conversation about equity and fairness. We have seen the press release figures that show that it is just a few states that are contributing to the Value Added Tax, which everyone is sharing.\n\n\u201cWe have long talked about the states that are producing the oil that we all are sharing proceeds from.\n\n\u201cEveryone has seen how some states do not even make an effort to raise their internally generated revenue (IGR) because they are comfortable with receiving federal allocations from work done by others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut now that the receipts are dwindling, even those states are waking up to the conversation and asking if they can keep what they make.\n\n\u201cCan there be a better time to discuss resource control constitutional amendments are a must. They are a big reason why we have the legislative arm of government. As time passes, new generations are born, and new conversations emerge. We must, as a people, be ready to move with the times. This is the only way to move forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, as you meet, I hope you can raise these thorny issues that have eluded those who came before you. You may not be able to resolve them, but you would at least acknowledge that there is an elephant in the room. This is an important first step.\u201d",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years on, what has #YouTubeBlack Voices done for African creators?",
          "text": "When TNC Africa, a Nigerian television production company, wanted to launch long-form video content that tells original African stories to the world, it chose YouTube as its medium. It was evident that YouTube could provide a platform that would connect it to the world and provide sufficient data for analytics on its audience. \u201cBeing an early-stage startup where data is super important, and one that does a lot of data analytics, we needed a platform where we could get access to that data, and YouTube offered that, \u201c Olawale Adetula, co-founder of TNC Africa said.\n\nAdetula explained that YouTube has the largest share of the video-watching audience it is targeting in Africa, such that even android phones have the app pre-installed.\n\nWhile YouTube aims to provide a platform for creators globally to explore their creativity, in 2020, it shined a special focus on Africa when it launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. The $100 million Fund\u2014created by YouTube as a response to the racial injustice that characterised 2020\u2014is a 3-year initiative dedicated to spotlighting and growing black creators on YouTube, from across the world, by providing them with funding, resources, and mentorship that will help them thrive on the platform.\n\nThe Fund, in the past 2 years, has worked closely with African content creators, musical artists, and, recently, producers and songwriters, offering them seed funding to develop their channels, training focused on upgrading their production, community engagement and wellbeing skills as well as workshops and networking programmes to help them grow their channels.\n\nAdetula\u2019s biggest takeaway from the Fund is the opportunity to network with and form relationships with over 135 other top creators around the world. The Fund\u2019s structure, which encourages every creator to work with another creator, plays a role in ensuring that these relationships are formed; and has translated into upcoming collaborations for TNC Africa, too.\n\nTNC Africa\u2019s target audience has also broadened beyond Africa as a result of the programme. \u201cWe were creating content and targeting viewers within Africa or with African interest because we never thought our content could be appealing to non-Africans. Today, the number of viewers we are getting from the UK, US, Ireland, and South America is steadily increasing since we implemented some of the things we learnt from the YouTube Black Voices Fund.\u201d More people outside Nigeria are getting interested in content created by Nigerian YouTubers.According to data made available to TechCabal by YouTube, over 75% of watch time on content produced by channels in Nigeria comes from outside Nigeria.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s inaugural cohort last year featured a Creator Class of 20 content creators, from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Its Artist Class featured 3 African artists: Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol, South Africa\u2019s Soma Jozi, and Nigeria\u2019s Fireboy\u2014who have gone on to use the platform to connect with their fans.\n\nFireboy\u2019s \u201cPeru\u201d remix with pop star, Ed Sheeran, has gone global, with the song topping music charts across the world. During his time on the programme, on YouTube, he performed a live stream concert to over 83,000 fans who watched the virtual performance, to celebrate Africa Month.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices helped award-winning Kenyan Afro-pop group Sauti Sol become the first Kenyan act to be included on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\nKenyan Afro-pop band, Sauti Sol, perform their Midnight Train album in a virtual concert that has raked over a million views on YouTube. Addy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, YouTube, spoke about Sauti Sol\u2019s excitement when the Fund put their pictures on billboards in New York, Los Angeles and London. \u201cIt was a great Kenya-to-the-world story. They were already celebrated in Kenya; it was amazing to be a part of their success and help them break out of Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures made available to TechCabal by YouTube, in Kenya, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in Kenyan shillings) has increased by over 60%, year over year. While over 400 channels have at least 100 thousand subscribers\u2014an increase of over 70%, year over year\u20146 channels have over 1 million subscribers; and 1 channel has over 1 billion views. Over 45% of watch time on content produced by channels in Kenya comes from outside of Kenya.\n\nWhile the inaugural class had 20 creators and 3 artists from Africa, for the 2022 class, YouTube increased the number to 26 content creators and 4 artists; while creating a new class, for producers and songwriters, a development the Fund said demonstrates its continued support for artists on the platform.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices placed Nigerian artist CKay on a billboard in Los Angeles\n\nA member of the newly-created songwriters and producers class is Nigeria\u2019s brilliant 20-year-old producer, P.Priime, who has produced hits for some of the biggest names in Nigeria\u2019s music industry, including Wizkid, Fireboy, and Olamide. He further blew up this year after it became known that he produced Nigerian artist Asa\u2019s album (except for one song).\n\nP.Priime had heard about the Artist Class but originally didn\u2019t know there was going to be a category for producers, so he was excited when he heard about the newly introduced class. \u201cI was excited that people were starting to recognise the work producers do. I feel we are finally getting our flowers, and people are starting to see our importance beyond working with artists,\u201d P.Priime told TechCabal.\n\nWhen P.Priime joined the programme, they helped him organise his channel, and he started sharing his process\u2014with his video where he took his fans through the making of Nigerian artist Reekado Bank\u2019s hit \u201cOzumba Mbadiwe\u201d raking 63,000 views.\n\nThe Fund helped him get new equipment and has provided him with an opportunity to connect with artists across the world. Although his YouTube channel is monetised, he said he is not all about the money: \u201cIt is giving a piece of P.Priime to my audience, documenting my work process and using the opportunity to reach new audiences even when I am not dropping new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the challenges that African YouTubers face, Awofisayo blamed the late delivery of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\u2014which allows them to monetise their YouTube channel\u2014on African YouTube creators\u2019 countries\u2019 bad postal services. Awofisayo further explained that the reason YouTube sends the PIN via postal service is to prevent identity theft and circumvent fraud.\n\nAwofisayo said that the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund was created to encourage black creators and artists to get on YouTube, amplify their voices, and create an opportunity for them to be successful on the platform. But she revealed that beneficiaries of the Fund do not get preferential treatment or get prioritised on the platform.\n\nAwofisayo revealed that the selection of newer and early-stage creators\u2014creators that have been on the platform for a few years\u2014is a shift from last year when most beneficiaries were established content creators. Awofisayo said YouTube wants to also empower more creators like Nigeria\u2019s Mark Angel, who has built a production company out of his YouTube channel. \u201cIn the long run, we want to make sure that black creators, not just those in the fund, are able to be successful on our platform, and that our platform is an enabler to their creative success,\u201d she said.\n\nNigerian content creator, Tomike Adeoye, a member of the 2022 class of creators made an Instagram post where she expressed gratitude to YouTube for its support and the BlackVoices Fund for providing funds. \u201cThank you for #YouTubeBlack. Thank you for being a great source of income! Just seeing us and doing what we love, we see the dollars flow in our account monthly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn Nigeria, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in naira) is also up by over 60%, year over year, with over 650 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 50%, year over year. Still in Nigeria, 35 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of 50%, year over year.\n\nIn South Africa, the percentage of YouTube channels making 6 figures or more in revenue (in rands) is up over 40%, year over year, with over 300 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 60%, year over year.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Fantasy sports in Africa: Can $3m funding make it popular?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market. While these startups offer it as a standalone service, it is just one of several services that Khazna offers.\n\nThe startup also offers a buy now, pay later service, available in 1,000 merchant stores in Egypt. With 150,000 users, the startup is dreaming big and plans to increase that number to 1 million by the end of 2022.\n\nApril\u2019s Techpoint Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\n\nThe quote above attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggests that the man with a better product will always have the most customers.\n\nHowever, with numerous (identical) brands competing for our attention, it\u2019s not enough to have a good product. It would help if you told your story clearly and compellingly.\n\nNot everyone loves to speak before a crowd or even knows how to do it right, but you can get better with practice and feedback.\n\nAt Techpoint Pitch Friday, entrepreneurs not only get to pitch their startups before an enthusiastic crowd but get feedback that helps with product development or refining their pitch.\n\nIn March\u2019s edition, Dayo Oyekanmi and Oluwafemi Adeleke pitched Harmony and Siara, respectively, and it could be your turn this month.\n\nREGISTER for a chance to pitch your startup or be a part of the audience on Friday, April 8, 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "title": "Kaduna train attack eyewitness account: How mobile technology saved lives",
          "text": "One survivor of the terror attack Monday on a Kaduna bound Abuja train, Anas Iro Danmusa, has recounted how his phone call and use of social media from inside the attacked train saved the lives of hundreds of passengers.\n\nHe also narrated other unpleasant experiences he and other passengers encountered while inside the train including the presence of two suspected terrorists holding guns and walkie talkies.\n\nDanmusa said a combination of social media use helped in alerting the authorities about the situation.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is to express my sincere appreciation to the Facebook family for being there for us \u2013 those that were on the Kaduna-bound train that was attacked by terrorists on Monday night.\n\nRead also: How I survived the Abuja-Kaduna train attack \u2013 survivor\n\n\u201cIt was amazing how a large number of facebookers swiftly acted upon our posts by sharing as suggested which led to the message reaching the appropriate people and authorities within just a short time. It also led to the message crossing to all social media platforms.\n\n\u201cIf not for your efforts, only God knows what would have happened to us. As you were there for us, may God also come to the aid of each and every one of you in your time of need. We cannot thank you enough!\n\n\u201cIt all started from our coach on the train where I wanted to use my phone to seek help but other passengers were highly against it because phone brightness meant more shooting in that direction.\n\n\u201cThat was how I first contacted my vibrant special bro Al-Amin Sulaiman that has always been there for me. Before I could do that, my head and hands together with the phone were covered with the green train seat cover to avoid drawing attention.\n\n\u201cIn just a few minutes, I was already on the phone with Samuel Aruwan\u2026you should know who that is because he is a hero.\n\n\u201cThat was how he requested I share our location on WhatsApp and to the glory of God, it went through using airtel despite the poor network coverage.\n\nRead also: Train attack: What is integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution?\n\n\u201cHe then forwarded it to the Army Officers and that was how we were tracked on time. Note that all the terrible things were happening at the same time but I was making efforts to make contact in order for us to get help.\n\n\u201cMy brother was able to engage me with the DSS, one Brigadier General Adebayo and Hon. Commissioner Samuel Aruwan.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers informed me that the air force could not make it due to the weather but help was on the way and they fulfilled their promise.\n\n\u201cI could say their response and arrival was the fastest anybody could achieve by road. I can never forget what the HQ Nigerian Army did for us.\n\n\u201cThey responded swiftly, rescued us, comforted us, gave the badly injured priority and made sure they were dispatched to 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital and finally took the rest of us to the same destination with mostly their buses. I pray you to keep growing stronger and winning your battles against the enemies of the nation.\n\n\u201d I also pray that God gives the FG the wisdom and capacity to keep supporting you in the best way that will enable you to discharge your responsibilities. We are very proud of you. Not forgetting the DSS and the role they also played. We are so grateful. May God give you the wisdom to keep tracking the bad elements in our society and making it better for all of us.\n\n\u201cWhat this terrible situation reminds me of is having competent leadership. If Mr Aruwan was out of the equation, the story would have been different no doubt.\n\n\u201cHis quick response to the situation and in engaging the army makes him a competent and reliable public servant. He is an example of what we are lacking in leadership in Nigeria. I must thank the Executive Governor too, His Excellency, Nasir El-Rufai for putting in place competent people that can actually get things done without excuses or pointing fingers.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to draw the attention of the Nigerian Railway Corporation NRC to how grossly they take records of passengers.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t know when keeping a record professionally is important until when the need for the record emerges even when you don\u2019t use it to make future plans and policies\u2026\n\n\u201cLet me start by myself as an example. I bought my ticket at the Kubwa train station. The guy that sold me the ticket collected my information before printing and giving me my ticket.\n\n\u201cFrom the passenger manifest, I observed that 08087545321 was the number against my name which I don\u2019t recognize. I think it was randomly assigned to me which is illegal.\n\n\u201cCheck serial no. 268 and 269 you\u2019ll see 33333333333 for both as phone numbers. Check 223 and 224 you\u2019ll see 6495999999 and 9292999999 as phone numbers respectively. Are those numbers phone numbers?\n\n\u201cSome of the passengers I spoke with were also assigned wrong numbers, especially those that didn\u2019t buy tickets online.\n\n\u201cThe NRC management needs to do better by doing the job given to them satisfactorily by showing a high level of professionalism. Lack of good record keeping has its own consequences.\n\n\u201cOn the train, we saw many things. We have seen dots but we couldn\u2019t connect anything until after the attack when we were miraculously rescued.\n\n\u201cThe NRC and the government, in general, have a lot to do to be able to succeed in rendering trouble-free train services apart from installing explosive detectors and other gadgets.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, what shocked me the most was to see about 3 doors left open on a moving train. I have never seen or heard that and I don\u2019t know how it happened. It was one elderly man that felt it was weird and had to close them because it was dangerous.\n\n\u201d Two unverified claims that I want to share which the NRC could use in improving the safety of passengers are: many passengers claimed they saw weird things and these people are not the types that you\u2019ll say it was the trauma of the incidence that was affecting them or they did not know what they were doing.\n\n\u201cSome passengers said they saw a strange man that was not in uniform with a walkie talkie phone but they felt it wasn\u2019t their business.\n\n\u201cNote that the terrorists that attacked the train were using walkie talkie phones to communicate with the person co-ordinating things from outside. Hope you get the point?\n\n\u201cAgain, a lady saw someone that was part of a gang that kidnapped her some time ago and had the intention of raising an alarm at Rigasa train station if not for the unfortunate event that happened.\n\n\u201cThese two claims were shared with us but I believe even if they are not true, the NRC as part of the new strict measures that will be in place, could use this information so as to avoid future occurrence of such.\n\n\u201cFinally, my heart goes out to those that lost their lives and their families, may their souls rest in peace. I pray that God makes it easy for those kidnapped and their families too, may He enable them to make it back home safely and in good health.\n\n\u201cWe that were traumatised, God knows best the right punishment for the evil, may those callous people never know peace anywhere they are and may any unrepentant TERRORIST die a miserable death.\n\n\u201cIf our leaders keep being indifferent about the difficulty the citizenry face, I pray God replaces them with those that will care for us and make the country a much better place for us all\u201d, he ended.",

          "title": "Women\u2019s empowerment is complex \u2013 Mfon Ekpo, CEO of The Discovery Centre",
          "text": "Mfon Ekpo is the CEO of The Discovery (Training and Development) Centre, a founding partner, and an Executive Director with the John Maxwell Team. She is widely known by the moniker- The Excavator however after a riveting evening with her in Abuja, I\u2019d add to that list, the title- Mental & Emotional Architect.\n\nAs a certified human behaviour consultant, development strategist and professional negotiator, she has served as a member of the President\u2019s Advisory Council and is a two-time recipient of the \u2018Golden Quill\u2019 award by the National Academy of Bestselling Authors in Hollywood for co-authoring two bestselling books with renowned leading experts such as Brian Tracy and Robert Allen amongst others.\n\nShe has spoken and taught at The University of Oxford, Yale, Harvard, Howard University, The University of Southampton and High Point University, North Carolina amongst others.\n\nMfon serves as an advisor to leaders around the world, a Mentor on the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme (TEEP) and sits on the Board of Directors of Wentors, an information technology organization with a mandate to increase the rate of participation and retention of Women in Technology.\n\nLatasha Ngwube\n\nYou are the founder of The Discovery Centre. What exactly is its mission?\n\nThe Discovery Centre is a human potential and performance Coaching, Training and Development organization. We specialize in developing effective systems, strategies, and structure for individual or organizational development.\n\nBased on years of evaluating the huge reserve of latent talent and possibilities within Nigeria\u2019s demographic composition, especially with women, our core focus over the past 7 years has been helping women from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of expertise investigate, excavate, and harness these latent capabilities and then translate them into profitable, impact driven ventures.\n\nAlthough we focused on women initially, the continuing demand resulted in our programs being opened to men also.\n\nIn these times when the general idea of motivational speaking has been reduced to an \u201cAspire to perspire\u201d rhetoric, how do you separate yourself and your calling from the rest?\n\nFirst, in spite of all the clich\u00e9s that surround it, motivational speaking has and will always be pivotal in galvanizing action and driving change. From Lincoln\u2019s \u2018Gettysburg address\u2019 to Mandela\u2019s \u201cI Am Prepared to Die\u201d speech at the Rivonia Trial. Words alter mindsets, challenge human consciousness and are by far, one of best methods in painting a picture of possibilities. Think of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s 1588 speech to the troops at Tilbury,\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, I am come amongst you at this time, not as for recreation or sport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live or die amongst you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honor and my blood, even the dust.\n\nI know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart of a King, and of a King of England, too; and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realms: to which, rather than any dishonour \u2026 I myself will take up arms; I myself will be your General, Judge, and Rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.\u201d\n\nWhat power. What a tool. What a speech!\n\nSo, I very much wear the \u2018aspire to perspire\u2019 badge attached to motivational speaking with honour but also with an intrinsic of understanding of its power and how to harness it.\n\nTo that end, I don\u2019t seek to separate myself from the rest, I seek instead to do my job of speaking, training, and coaching so well that it produces the results that it needs to deliver. That is the separator, I guess.\n\nCan you recall the exact moment you decided \u2018The Law\u2019 could not and would not be the career path for you to follow till the end?\n\nOh, you never fully \u2018leave\u2019 law, if you really studied it as I did from Business law to Public and International law, to Maritime law and Aviation law. It never really lets you go; it follows you everywhere like a jealous lover.\n\nI was my mother\u2019s legal handbag and through her, I developed the love for law. She was a Legal Adviser and Director in the Ministry of Justice, and I was studying law so it we were a tag team of senior lawyer and baby lawyer. We had our plans \u2013 everything from opening a law firm to becoming a SAN but I knew very early I was not going to actively practice law the way practice was known at the time. I was more fascinated in teaching it, writing about it or just exhaustively pointing out the loopholes in it. I considered dropping it all together, but my mum encouraged me to complete the study of it because I was good. After Law school, precisely on the day of my Call to Bar, after I had been presented the award for National Overall Best Student in Professional Ethics, she said \u201cYou have done that which I have asked, never once complaining, you now have a knowledge of law and you have excelled at it. I am certain that in a world that trades on power no one can intimidate or diminish you.\n\nSo, give me this certificate and go do whatever you want to do with your life, your bases are covered\u201d.\n\nI knew she still worried about what I would do with my life and what a speaker\u2019s career trajectory was, but then in 2013 she accompanied me to the International Maxwell Certification in Orlando Florida. I was billed to speak and sharing the stage with John Maxwell, Les Brown, Nick Vujicic, speaking to over 2000 leaders from over 54 countries.\n\nWhen I finished and got off the stage, she said \u2013 \u201cI was wrong to worry. I just watched a young African woman who happens to be my daughter hold a room of leaders from around the world spellbound. This where you belong\u2013 on stage, speaking to people\u2019s hearts and minds and I\u2019m glad I got to witness it. So do it and never look back\u201d.\n\nI have never looked back.\n\nWhy did you decide to study under John Maxwell and how exactly did you go about making it happen?\n\nI have always been fascinated by human behaviour, personal development, and its connection to the transformational development of a country or continent.\n\nJohn Maxwell was the prime example of the impact one man could have in the lives of individuals, organizations, and countries. I wanted that. I wanted all of that and I wanted it direct from source. I wanted to be taught by the best, so I packed my bags and went in search of him, got into the program he was offering at the time.\n\nI was one of the first Africans to join his team, became a Founding Partner of the John Maxwell Team and a member of the Presidents\u2019 Advisory Council, working closely with him at mentorship level, and travelling with him to countries like Guatemala, Costa Rica , Paraguay at the invitation of their governments to conduct nationwide transformational leadership trainings.\n\nWhy has it been so important to you to focus on women in your work?\n\nThe World Bank in its 2012 Development Report stated that it was slower to implement women empowerment initiatives in Africa than in any other region of the world. That was shocking to me and so I set out to investigate that narrative, travelling to the various regions of Africa- from Kenya, to Uganda, South Africa, Ghana , Cameroon , Nigeria discovering it wasn\u2019t that these women empowerment initiatives didn\u2019t work but that there was little or no understanding of the socio economic, political, cultural or religious contexts of these women before interventions were prescribed or in some cases imposed to mark standardised developmental milestones.\n\nWomen\u2019s empowerment, especially in Africa, is more complex, non-linear, and unpredictable than generic development models assume and understanding the underlying causative factors of their behaviour could speed up the process of change and development within their communities.\n\nSo, immersing myself in their communities, I worked within their contexts to create context specific developmental models, influence policy and drive socio- economic change.\n\nThis birthed the 7-year targeted development program for women called \u201cThe Blueprint of How\u201d, which has now reached over 300,000 women-driven businesses not just in Africa but around the world. The McKinsey Global Institute reports that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) could grow by 23 percent\u2014or $229 billion\u2014by 2025, if women participated in the economy to the degree that men did. I think this picture is self-explanatory \u2013except we begin to take seriously our focus on women we will always be behind the curve terms of development. That\u2019s why I focus on women.\n\nRead also: Metaverse value to hit $8trn by 2030, with five billion users\n\nWhat have you found to be the most rewarding thing about the work you do now?\n\nThere is nothing like turning on a lightbulb in someone\u2019s life that had come to accept darkness as their norm. Seeing people, especially women, move from accepting life as is, to creating the life they really want never gets tired for me. Witnessing the transformation and the impact of one person being on fire, Swiss Psychologist Carl Jung once said the most damaging thing in the life of a child is the unlived life of a parent. So, when one person gets it right, entire households are affected. Children send me notes of what they studied while their parents were on a coaching call. It is wholesome transformation at the most cellular level of impact.\n\nDo you believe women can have it all and if you do, then do you have it all?\n\nI think you can have it all \u2013 I do, the caveat is you just must define what \u201call\u201d means to you and understand the seasons of how \u201call\u201d may manifest. Some fruit doesn\u2019t manifest as a fruit just because you want it to. It can first manifest as a seedling and if you understand that then you don\u2019t keep complaining that you don\u2019t have the desired fruit, you work with the seedling. It all doesn\u2019t come at once, it really shouldn\u2019t \u2013 it would be too overwhelming, but it does come. So, I don\u2019t teach balance, I teach seasons. Your life can be so out of balance in one season, but that season can accommodate it in a way other seasons in your life may not be able to. For example, when a woman starts a business, in that season, something else may be deprived of time, but if she understands that she can prepare for it, prepare those around her to support her with what that particular season of her life requires and let go of the guilt of reduced availability. When we compare seasons and act like it\u2019s all the same, we suffer. Life and nature revolve around seasons not necessarily balance.\n\nThe work you do sounds very high minded and complex. Have you ever suffered imposter syndrome and how did you overcome it?\n\nNot at all. I think the rise of the feeling of Imposter Syndrome in our generation is the effect of certain causes, one of the major ones being Speed. We are geared towards speed -speed of accomplishment, speed of election, speed of positioning, speed of recognition and the list goes on. And while not altogether bad, speed comes at a cost, the cost which is the circumvention of the process one needs to go through to be ready for exposure, opportunity, position or recognition.\n\nThe process is the pruning period that eliminates ego , exposes error, uncovers your insecurities, reveals faulty conditioning then centres, teaches, matures, prepares you and helps you redefine meaning.\n\nWhen you are ready, not perfect, but ready, imposter syndrome becomes an insignificant threat because anything ceases to be risky when you are equipped for it.\n\nEver felt imposter syndrome on the topic of brushing your teeth or bathing? You have done it so many times, in so many ways that it would be laughable to have imposter syndrome about that.\n\nAs simplified as that example is, the point is \u2013 The triune factors of Expertise, Experience and Time destroys Imposter Syndrome. But alas, speed doesn\u2019t adequately deliver those \u2013 Process does.\n\nBecause I am keenly aware of this, I take my life and career processes very seriously. I can attribute the absolute lack of imposter syndrome to that.\n\nWho are the kind of women (people) that need your services?\n\nAnyone convinced there is more to them than what they are presently deploying. Particularly those who have reached some level of achievement or acclaim. It is the most dreadful thing to live in the prison of your own achievements. It becomes hard to even speak about it because everyone else thinks you should be grateful and excited, but you are really dying inside. Sometimes it manifests as overwhelm, the loss of joy at the present, dissatisfaction, lethargy, and just all-round discontent. Most people who haven\u2019t experienced this can be completely blind to it so the lack of empathy is as crippling at that level.\n\nWhat makes you so highly sought after in this field of personal development?\n\nI would not presume to suggest there is a single answer to that or suggest that is the consequence of just one thing but this much I know: Results are the top of my value list. I am a dog on bone when it comes to getting results, I won\u2019t let go. When clients trust me to help them figure out their lives or businesses, they are also in the same breath trusting me with their pain- the parts of their lives or businesses they keep protected and I am acutely aware of it. That is sacred, it is delicate surgery and requires an enormous amount of courage and trust. So, it\u2019s not a prescriptive process from me in the sense that I don\u2019t just tell them what to do, Personal development, the real kind, is not a walk in the park, its difficult enough on its own. So, its tag team once I get involved with a person or organization. I enter the trenches with them, walk the journey with them, face their giants with them, till the transformation they desire happens. Till water turns to steam.",

          "text": "What is the origin of your business story?\n\nFA\u2019AZE originated from a combination of motivating influence, learnings from a previous business venture, and God\u2019s perfect timing. The primary motive in starting the business was to create a brand that represents how well modesty can be infused into fashion. I endorse the saying \u2018look good, feel good\u2019, so it was necessary to provide products that make consumers feel comfortable and confident. Also, as a humanitarian at heart, it was important to own a business that gives back; hence a percentage of FA\u2019AZE proceeds is dedicated to charity.\n\n2. What advice do you have for your 18 year old self?\n\nNever doubt your capabilities. It is okay to make mistakes and learn as you grow, but always remember to be deliberate and passionate about your goals. Block out all the noise, trust the process and create your own story!\n\nRead also: Reps suspend legislative business over Kaduna killings\n\n3. How have you been able to scale your business?\n\n\u2013 Marketing and Referrals: Marketing especially on social media has been a key strategy in the success of the business. Through content creation and sponsored adverts, we have been able to engage with various audiences, reach more customers and create better brand awareness. Referrals have also played a huge role in driving sales growth.\n\n\u2013 Team Work: Having the right people on board who understand what the business stands for and are actively working to meet targets has set a strong foundation for our progress.\n\n\u2013 Maintaining Quality and Consistency: As a brand, quality of product and service is our number one priority. Assessing customers needs and being consistent in the quality of products we offer, allows us to build trust and effectively deliver services.\n\n4. How did you come up with the idea for your business?\n\nThe idea stemmed from wanting to do more and taking chances. I work a 9-5 but have always believed in having a \u2018safety net\u2019, and that is what FA\u2019AZE is to me and more. It drives me to take risks, be innovative and challenge myself daily. I also noticed that there was significant market demand for such products and took the initiative with a leap of faith. FA\u2019AZE is still growing but today, I can gladly say I made the right decision and indeed \u2018there is no limit to what we as women can accomplish.\u2019",

The growth in NIR reflects the significant increase in customer transactions resulting in 84.9% growth in trade income, 48.1% in account maintenance charge, and 47.2% increase in digital banking income.\n\nCommenting on the bank\u2019s performance, Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, MD/CEO, Fidelity Bank Plc noted, \u201cWe closed the financial year with strong double-digit growth in profit and across key balance-sheet lines, which reflects the disciplined execution of our strategy and capacity to deliver superior returns to shareholders. Profit before tax grew by 35.7% to N38.1bn from N28.1bn in 2020FY, which translates to an increase in RoAE to 12.5% from 10.5% in 2020FY.\u201d\n\nOther areas of the financial result recorded significant increases in the period under review with total interest and similar income increasing by N26.8bn. Similarly, Total Deposits increased by 19.2% to N2.025tr from N1.699tr in 2020FY, Local currency deposits grew by 16.0% and account for 80.3% of Total Deposits while foreign currency deposits increased by 33.9% and accounts for 19.7% of Total Deposits from 17.5% in 2020FY.\n\nDetailing the contribution of the bank\u2019s digital-led retail strategy to its financial performance, Onyeali-Ikpe stated, \u201cDigital Banking gained further traction driven by new initiatives in our retail business and the enhancement of existing digital banking products. We now have 56.0% of our customers enrolled on the mobile/internet banking products and 90.0% of total customer-induced transactions done on digital platforms with digital banking business contributing 27.6% to net fee income.\u201d\n\nDespite headwinds occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bank\u2019s share price rose by 35% between January 2021and April 01, 2022, placing it among the most actively traded stocks on the Nigerian bourse floor. The performance of the Bank\u2019s share price is a reflection of the high investor confidence in its strong fundamentals and leadership team.\n\n\u201cMy team and I are committed to achieving the long-term strategic objectives of Fidelity Bank while we look forward to sustaining the current performance trend and delivering strong set of results for the 2022FY\u201d, explained Onyeali-Ikpe.",

          "text": "Minister of Transportation and former governor of Rivers State, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has joined the 2023 presidential race, maintaining that he is Igbo and can run on the Igbo platform.\n\nAmaechi in his yet-to-be unveiled manifesto obtained by TheNiche, said he is in the race because he is \u201cqualified to serve.\u201d\n\nThough he is yet formally declare his aspiration, his manifesto, quoted him as saying, \u201cI believe that the destiny of Nigeria can only be best actualized in the context of one indivisible and united nation.\n\n\u201cWhat is required is for us to continue to work towards a nation in which the doors of opportunity are open to all our citizens irrespective of ethnicity, creed, class or circumstance.\u201d\n\nTitled, \u201cQualified to Serve,\u201d the 86-page brochure, which is his pitch for the APC ticket, highlighted why he decided to contest \u2013 his competitive advantages, broad and deep experiences in governance, nationalist outlook, geopolitical considerations, political prowess, personality and leadership, track record of performance, highlights of achievements as Rivers State Governor and Minister of Transportation and what he called \u201challmarks of Amaechi\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nIn what seems like an attempt to address the issue of inclusion, Amaechi said: \u201cWe must give meaning to democracy so that every Nigerian can find a place and a voice in a land of free men and women. We must deploy our diversity to increase our strength. We must make our streets and highways, and now forests and farmlands, safe again for all Nigerians to fulfill their individual dreams of a good life so that, together, we can actualize the manifest destiny of this blessed land.\u201d\n\nItemising the focus of his campaign, Amaechi said, \u201cWe need to quickly replace the politics of impressions and personalities with the politics of issues and ideas. We must seek common ground on broad national issues on a bipartisan basis, not on the basis of personalities or geopolitical zones, tribes or factions.\n\n\u201cThe common ground must be based on a dispassionate grasp of national problems: how do we educate our children, heal the sick, give hope to those in despair, provide succour to the needy and find work for the unemployed? How do we build infrastructure that will quickly transform and modernize our economy for the good of all Nigerians?\n\nAmaechi said courage, stamina, and resilience are some of the virtues that make him tower above others.\n\nAddressing the question of his Igbo identity he said, \u201cMy birth names are Igbo names Chibuike Amaechi. I am an Igbo man. Let no one deny me my Igbo heritage, birthright, ancestry, please!\n\n\u201cUnless you want to be sectional and deny the Igbo people. I have made myself clear repeatedly, that I, Chibuike Amaechi from Ikwerre, am an Igbo man. Our people are Igbo people.\u201d\n\nThe minister urged his party, the APC, to look towards Ndigbo for the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cAs APC prepares to conduct the primaries to choose the party\u2019s flagbearer, they must pay attention to all the geopolitical factors at play.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, there is a strong push for power to shift to the South in 2023 and specifically to the Igbos. Igbos have not been at the centre since the Second Republic more than 40 years ago, when late Alex Ekwueme was Vice President in the Shehu Shagari Administration. Not surprisingly there is loud agitation from the Igbos that they should have their turn to lead the government.\n\n\u201cOther groups are also pleading the case of the Igbos in the name of equity and the stability of the country. Leader of Pan Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has warned that Igbos should produce the president in 2023 election, if Nigeria hopes to enjoy peace. The Association of Arewa Community in Igboland has also urged Nigerians to consent to an Igbo becoming the President of the country in 2023.\n\n\u201cChibuike Amaechi is an Igbo man of Ikwerre stock. His hometown Ubima is on the border of Imo State and the fact that Nigeria\u2019s modern geopolitical map places it in the South-South region does not change the fact that Ikwerre are a dialectical group of the Igbo nation. By ethnicity, language and heritage, Amaechi is no less Igbo than a man from Abriba, Owerri, Ebonyi, Awka or Enugu-Ukwu.\u201d\n\nAddressing those who insist that only Igbo from the Southeast are qualified since zoning is done on regional basis, the brochure said Amaechi coming from South-South gives him a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cIn addition, he also has the unique advantage of being not only Igbo but a Niger Deltan. This means that Amaechi could also find favour with those currently insisting that the next President should come from the South-South on the basis that their region only completed one elected term under President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cThere are some in other parts of the country who may find it more politically expedient to throw their lot behind a South-South candidate than behind a \u201ctraditional\u201d Igbo man.\n\n\u201cAs much as Amaechi\u2019s tribe and geo-political zone give him an advantage, he also has the advantage of being a candidate who is a true national figure \u2013 recognized all over Nigeria, with friends and allies across the length and breadth of the country.\n\n\u201cSome people vying for office also have recognizable names but are identified so resolutely with their tribe or zone that they cannot be effective national consensus candidates.\n\n\u201cFew of Amaechi\u2019s contenders have had the same opportunity or share the same disposition that allows him to travel to every state of the Federation, forge alliances and build relationships.\n\n\u201cBeloved by his people in the Niger Delta, he is also embraced by the South East as a true Igbo son and lauded in the South West for providing the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway system which has been a source of pride and renewed economic activity in the region. The North see him as a friend, a truly detribalized Nigerian who does not discriminate against tribe or religion and who has worked tirelessly to support President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the cap fits him because he has a \u201cthorough understanding of the complexities of the nation \u2013 the challenges of balancing the interests and influences in a country of different persuasions, traditions, cultures, religions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile others fan the flames of ethnic tension for their own selfish political advantage, Amaechi has consistently championed national unity, identifying ethnic divisiveness as an obstacle to progress.\u201d",

          "text": "Russian forces are creating \u201ca complete disaster\u201d, leaving mines around homes and even corpses, Ukraine\u2019s president has said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy issued the warning to his people early on Saturday as Russian troops continued to withdraw from areas around Kyiv.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey are mining the whole territory.\n\n\u201cThey are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.\u201d\n\nMr Zelenskyy said Ukrainians should wait until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed, before trying to resume their normal lives.\n\nRussia said earlier this week that it would reduce military activity around the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv, claiming this would increase trust between both sides at peace talks.\n\nMr Zelenskyy said on Friday, however, that Russia would simply re-group before pushing towards the east of Ukraine for a renewed assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing Russian forces in the vicinity of Kyiv.\n\nRussian forces are also reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport near the capital, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict.\n\nKey developments:\n\n\u2022 The US will provide an additional $300m (\u00a3228m) in security assistance to Ukraine, including laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services\n\n\u2022 A Red Cross convoy travelling to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol will make another attempt to evacuate civilians from the besieged port today\n\n\u2022 Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Ukrainian think tank Penta, said the fall of Mariupol could determine the fate of peace talks, adding: \u201cMariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, and without its conquest, Putin cannot sit down at the negotiating table\u201d\n\n\u2022 As Russia starts to pull back from Kyiv and Chernihiv, Ukraine said its military had retaken 29 settlements in those regions\n\n\u2022 At least three Russian ballistic missiles were fired from the Crimean Peninsula at the Odesa region, but Ukrainian air defence stopped them from hitting critical infrastructure, the military said.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Russia, described by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as \u201cnot something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the (peace) talks\u201d.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said that the fuel lost from the ruined oil tanks, near the Russian city of Belgorod, could worsen the supply problems hampering the Russian military.\n\nThe MoD said Russian troops near Kharkiv \u2013 about 40 miles from Belgorod \u2013 could be \u201cparticularly affected\u201d.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack but, if Moscow is correct, it would be the country\u2019s first known incursion into Russian airspace.\n\nRussia has previously reported shelling from Ukraine, including an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, however.\n\nSky News",

          "text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has fostered close ties with Russia and refused to impose sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, is expected to extend his almost 10-year grip on power in the Balkan country when it holds national elections on Sunday.\n\nPolls predict that Vucic, a populist who has boasted about his personal ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, will win another five-year term as president.\n\nHis right-wing Serbian Progressive Party also is expected to continue to dominate the country\u2019s parliament.\n\nBut polls indicated a close local government race in the capital, Belgrade.\n\nA loss for Vucic\u2019s party there could undermine his increasingly autocratic rule.\n\nMost political parties taking part in the presidential, general and municipal elections lean right, reflecting the conservative stands prevalent among Serbia\u2019s 6.5 million voters.\n\nBut a new Green-left coalition campaigning on the need to tackle long-neglected environmental problems also is fielding candidates.\n\nOpposition party officials say Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only strengthened Vucic\u2019s dominance of Serbian politics and the mainstream media.\n\nSoon after Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the president\u2019s election slogan changed to \u201cPeace. Stability. Vucic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe war has diverted public attention from what is happening in Serbia and of course, with media support, enabled Vucic to blame the crisis for everything that is wrong in Serbia,\u201d Dragan Djilas, a leader of the biggest opposition coalition United Serbia, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cArticles are published here every day about how a kilogram of bread costs 9 euros in Italy and Germany, how they have no fuel, how they will have food stamps and how great we are,\u201d Djilas said.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared, and it always suits the authorities because people say, Let\u2019s not change anything now.\u201d\n\nSerbia, a traditional Russian ally, has rejected calls from the European Union and the United States to join in sanctions against Moscow, citing national interests.\n\nThe country\u2019s representative to the United Nations did vote in favour of a resolution condemning Moscow\u2019s attack on Ukraine as a violation of international law.\n\nDespite the Serbian government saying it is seeking EU membership, Vucic and his allies have refrained from condemning Russia over the invasion, a possible sign they want to avoid alienating pro-Russia voters ahead of Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nMuch of the pro-Russia sentiments among Serbs comes from their hatred of NATO; the Western military alliance bombed the country in 1999 to stop a bloody Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo, a Serbian province at the time.\n\nFormer Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said that imposing sanctions on Russia would be tantamount to \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because Moscow has blocked UN membership for Kosovo which declared independence in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf we are ready to give up Kosovo, then we can impose sanctions on Russia,\u201d Dacic said.\n\n\u201cBut if we are not ready, then we cannot.\u201d\n\nThousands of people in Serbia have turned out for pro-Putin rallies during the five-week invasion, waving Russian flags and displaying the letter Z \u2013 a symbol seen on Russian military vehicles in Ukraine.\n\nThe support for Moscow makes Serbia somewhat of an outlier in Europe.\n\nOpposition officials said that despite Vucic\u2019s almost full control of the media and the pro-Russian narrative that has been created leading up to the elections, they expect a good result on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, the situation in Ukraine was very clear. It is about Russian aggression, and we immediately condemned it,\u201d Dobrica Veselinovic, who is running for mayor of Belgrade as the candidate of the environmentalist We Must coalition.\n\nElection polls predict Vucic will win the presidential election outright on Sunday.\n\nIf he does not receive more that 50% of the vote, he would face an unpredictable runoff in two weeks, likely against opposition candidate Zdravko Ponos, a Western-educated former army general.\n\nThe election for National Assembly lawmakers was not scheduled until 2024, but Vucic called an early vote after criticism from the EU that Serbia\u2019s 2020 election had not been free and fair.\n\nThe opposition boycotted that election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any difference between these elections and those two years ago,\u201d political analyst Slobodan Stupar said.\n\n\u201cA parliament will be formed in which Vucic will have fewer lawmakers than now. He will be able to tell Europe, Yes, we are a democratic country. See how many enemies I have in parliament.\u201d",

          "text": "Will Smith, facing possible expulsion or suspension after he assaulted Chris Rock during last Sunday\u2019s Oscars telecast, has instead resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.\n\nThe move comes as the actor is embroiled in the gravest crisis of his career and as the organization behind the Academy Awards has struggled in its attempts to deal with the fallout from the altercation.\n\nIn a statement, Smith called his actions \u201cshocking, painful and inexcusable\u201d and said that he will accept any additional consequences that the Academy\u2019s Board of Governors deems appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cI betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.\u201d\n\nSmith also acknowledged that his actions overshadowed other winners at the 94th Academy Awards.\n\n\u201cI want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film,\u201d he stated, concluding with \u201cchange takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.\u201d\n\nAcademy president David Rubin replied to his resignation, saying in a statement, \u201cWe have received and accepted Mr. Will Smith\u2019s immediate resignation from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. We will continue to move forward with our disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Smith for violations of the Academy\u2019s Standards of Conduct, in advance of our next scheduled board meeting on April 18.\u201d\n\nDuring the ceremony, Smith charged the stage and struck Rock during the broadcast after Rock made a joke about the actor\u2019s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, likening her shaved head to the buzzcut sported by Demi Moore in \u201cG.I. Jane.\u201d Pinkett Smith suffers from hair loss due to alopecia.\n\nThe Academy later said it asked Smith to leave the ceremony and he refused. However, sources say the organization\u2019s leaders never formally requested he be ejected and producer Will Packer urged him to stay.\n\nDuring an appearance on GMA on Friday, Packer said that he said Smith should stay at the request of Rock \u2014 something Rock\u2019s camp has denied.\n\nIt\u2019s a very tangled narrative about what exactly went down behind the scenes. What is certain is that Smith ended up remaining at the Dolby Theatre, where he went on to win best actor for his performance in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional speech, Smith seemed to try to justify his actions by saying that his outburst was the result of the same protective instincts that led his character in the film, Richard Williams, to push his daughters, Venus and Serena Williams, to succeed in the world of tennis.\n\nHis speech, initial failure to apologize to Rock and his decision to attend the Vanity Fair party following the awards did not sit well with some members of the Academy.\n\nOn Monday, Smith finally apologized to Rock, saying, \u201cI was out of line and I was wrong.\u201d He added that he reacted emotionally because \u201ca joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear.\u201d\n\nAfter initially offering up a statement that said it did not condone violence, the Academy followed up with two subsequent statements that more forcefully criticized Smith.\n\nOn Wednesday, the group said Smith had violated the Academy\u2019s standards of conduct and that he had 15 days to provide a written response explaining his actions. The organization said Smith faced suspension, expulsion or other sanctions.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed the readiness of Nigeria to lead the digital technology aspiration of the 54 African countries.\n\nThis is just as Microsoft opened its first engineering hub, the African Development Centre worth $200 million, in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking Friday at the State House, Abuja, while playing host to the President of Microsoft Corporation, Brad Smith, accompanied by the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, the President said Nigeria \u201cis ready to welcome more initiatives and investments in digital technology,\u201d while appreciating Microsoft for an engineering hub, worth $200 million.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI have been informed that the African Development Centre in Nigeria is Microsoft\u2019s first engineering hub in Africa as the current investment stands at about $200 million.\n\n\u201cI have also been informed of Microsoft\u2019s skilling initiative that aims to train five million citizens and provide 27,000 jobs over the next three years. These initiatives are commendable and I urge you to expand them and continue to prioritise Nigeria as you roll out your global initiatives.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the visiting Microsoft team that as the largest economy and most populous country in Africa, Nigeria was positioned to play a strategic role in the global technology ecosystem and seek the right partnerships to harness the potentials.\n\nHe said one of such key partnerships was in the area of capacity building. According to him, his administration has shown great commitment to providing a conducive environment for investors and Nigeria\u2019s massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking was a proof that the efforts were yielding positive results.\n\nThe Nigerian President said: \u201cOur emphasis on the development of our Digital Economy has also positioned the sector as a prominent factor in the Nigerian economy. As the fastest growing sector of the Nigerian economy in 2020, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a very important role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are keen about building on the momentum as we continue to implement our National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy, along with other related policies.\u201d\n\nApart from partnership in the area of skills building, President Buhari said he looked forward to further partnerships that would support the digital infrastructure and innovation ecosystem, with regard to emerging technologies: \u201cI believe that this meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss how the Nigerian government can support the growth of your business here and how Microsoft can contribute to the growth of our economy through the active support of our policies and programmes.\u201d\n\nBuhari said he launched the Nigerian National Broadband Plan on the 19th of March 2020, with the aim of expanding broadband access across Nigeria and Microsoft\u2019s connectivity initiative aligns with the plan.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe it would be very useful and mutually beneficial to both Microsoft and Nigeria if your connectivity project is expanded beyond the current four locations in this country.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies play a key role in digital transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a number of indigenous companies have developed very useful solutions. We are willing to partner with Microsoft to make Nigeria the epicenter for innovative emerging technology in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe President commended the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and all industry stakeholders for their support for the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to sustain the momentum, I further direct that you and other stakeholders in the technology ecosystem keep the government fully informed of your ongoing and proposed activities that support the growth of our digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe have the potential of becoming your most lucrative market in Africa. As such, we urge you to continue to support the development of our digital economy. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support for Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria and on the African continent.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said he represented President Buhari at the inauguration of the African Development Centre, adding that Microsoft had over 200 Nigerians working for them in Nigeria and in Seattle.\n\nPantami noted that 320,000 Nigerians had also been trained on digital skills by the technology company.\n\nOn his part, the President of Microsoft and Vice Executive Chairman said the company would keep creating jobs to help build technology that would change the world, noting that the \u201cmulti-tasking approach\u201d also stretches to digital infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe pledge to train five million people in Nigeria in the future,\u201d Smith said, noting \u201c60,000 people had already enrolled for courses while 300,000 had completed various courses,\u201d said the\u2019 Microsoft President.\n\nSmith said the company had gone into partnership with other companies to increase Internet and broadband penetration, while efforts had been advanced in innovating technology that would fight corruption and preserve cultural heritages, like languages.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
