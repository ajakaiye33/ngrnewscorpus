          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nA Diabetologist at the AB Specialist Hospital, Surulere, Lagos, Dr. Akinniyi Akinmokun, has cautioned Nigerians against using bleaching creams containing steroids, noting that are dangerous.\n\nAkinmokun warned that those using bleaching creams containing steroids are at risk of suffering harmful side effects in the long term.\n\nAccording to him, steroids in bleaching creams are referred to as topical steroids, adding that using them often leads to the suppression of the internal production of steroids.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview on Tuesday in Lagos, Akinmokun explained that when an individual regularly takes external steroids, internal steroid production will be suppressed and will eventually stop completely.\n\nWhen this happens, the expert said the entire body system could collapse.\n\n\u201cSteroids are hormones that occur naturally in the body, they are natural products that the body depends on day to day to function. It is the steroids that maintain blood pressure and also maintain the integrity of cells.\n\n\u201cSo when the steroids are not there or they are low for any reason, the body will be in trouble because it will be unable to produce steroids and so it can\u2019t maintain anything. Once the system collapses from lack of steroids, an individual can die, because of the inability to maintain blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nOther long-term side effects, the diabetologist said are, \u201cSide effects like electrolyte imbalance, also, one can experience muscle frailty, the integrity of the bones will be affected which can lead to osteoporosis, it can also cause muscle weakness because it depicts potassium level.\u201d\n\nAkinmokun further explained that the suppression of the internal production of steroids may occur when the organ producing steroids gets damaged.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe organs that produce steroids are situated on top of the kidney and they are called adrenal glands. If for any reason that organ is damaged, it can\u2019t maintain anything.\n\n\u201cThe patient will be unable to maintain blood pressure, it will keep falling off. The person will feel dizzy because the blood pressure is low and the person can also die.\n\n\u201cAdrenal gland can also get damaged by diseases; it can get damaged by inadequate blood supply particularly when a patient bleeds too much either during delivery or during surgery.\u201d\n\nHe noted that anything that can cause severely low blood pressure for a long time can compromise the adrenal glands and prevent them from producing enough steroids.\n\nThe diabetologist implored Nigerians to carefully check the leaflets of their lotion and steer clear of creams containing steroids.\n\n\u201cAlways read the bottles of your cream before use,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere has reacted to the attack on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s presidential advance team to Daura, Katsina State and the explosive attack on Kuje Prison by gunmen.\n\nAfenifere said the attack on Buhari\u2019s advance team was a signal to the government and security agencies.\n\nJare Ajayi, the spokesman of Afenifere, said the enemies are informing Nigerians and security agencies that they are not afraid of anyone with the attack on Buhari\u2019s convoy.\n\nAjayi said the attacks are affirmations that the insecurity situation in Nigeria is getting out of hand at a rate faster than is acknowledged by the authorities who should deal with it.\n\nA terrorist group had on Tuesday, at Dutsinma, Katsina State, attacked the advance team of security guards, protocol and media officers ahead of Buhari\u2019s trip to Daura for Sallah.\n\nThe President is billed to be in Daura this week Friday for this year\u2019s Ed-il-Kabir festival.\n\nEvening of same day, suspected Boko Haram members stormed Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital Territory with explosives.\n\nReacting, Ajayi regretted that the two attacks were not isolated as reports of terrorism attacks occasioning loss of lives, kidnapping, raping, bodily harms etc occur on a daily basis.\n\nHe stated that what set the ones of this week apart was \u201cits derring-do nature. Another indication that the country is under siege.\u201d\n\nA statement by Ajayi reads: \u201cThe nature of these attacks should send serious signals to the governments, to the security agencies and indeed to all Nigerians. The one on the Presidential Team seems to be a coded language by enemies of the nation that they are not afraid of anyone notwithstanding the status of such a person. For, it goes without saying that a Presidential Team would normally be fortified. So, for a group to attack such a team must be out of sheer bravado \u2013 which unfortunately further exposed how vulnerable our security situation is\u201d.\n\nAjayi went further to state that the attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, like some other attacks that occurred in such areas, \u201cappears to be a statement by those enemies of Nigeria that they can strike anywhere and at any time. For, this Kuje attack, taken together with the fatal attack on a military team in Niger State last month, keeps reminding one of the build-up of the Afghanistan saga that led to the forceful take-over of government in that country last year. Everything needs to be done to ensure that such does not occur here\u201d.\n\nHe added that were federal government to be sincere in the way it has been handling security breaches in the past,\n\n\u201cThe situation would not have degenerated to this sorry pass. By this we are referring to the kid-glove manner by which the government and its security arms have been dealing with those caught in banditry and terrorism.\n\n\u201cNormally, anyone around the President or Governor ought to have a sense of safety just as the presence of government ought to be an assurance for the citizens regarding their security.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on the Presidential Team and on Kuje Prison, like the ones that had taken place in different parts of the country before, make Nigerians to feel more and more insecure. On a number of times, armed bandits have attacked governors, particularly those of Borno and Benue. They have attacked transport centres like airport and rail lines as well as military and police formations. These are places one should have a sense of highest safety and security. Their attacks on religious places and on clerics too seem to have become a routine. In that kind of situation, people\u2019s sense of helplessness became heightened.\u201d",

          "title": "Fears in Abuja over Boko Haram inmates\u2019 escape",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Aidoghie Paulinus, Molly Kilete, Godwin Tsa, Jude Idu, Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja, Christopher Oji\n\nFears have gripped residents of Abuja and neighbouring states following revelation that no fewer than 64 inmates undergoing trial for terrorism and others numbering 879 inmates of Kuje Medium Correctional Service, Abuja, were among the escapees after the attack on the facility on Tuesday night.\n\nMinister of Defence, Bashir Salihi Magashi, who made the confirmation after visiting the site, yesterday, emphasised that the attackers, mainly Boko Haram members, specifically came to free their members in detention.\n\nResidents leaving close to the area said heavy gunshots which started at about 10.p.m. lasted close to an hour. They said it was not clear who the gunmen were but it was believed they were some criminal elements.\n\nThough the minister said only one Civil Defence personnel lost his life during the attack, prison officers displayed three corpses as additional casualties.\n\nA prison officer alleged conspiracy, claiming that despite the Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC), and submachine gun at the disposal of the security agents on guard, there was no attempt to deploy the weapon.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists that came for the operation did not touch the APC and the submachine guns, but burnt down the official and personal cars beside them. There was no single resistance from the security forces on ground to confront the attackers. As of Monday this week, they had beefed up security around the prison following an intelligence report of a possible attack. They increased the numbers of the army, police, Civil Defence and our own armed squad, yet none of them was courageous enough to attack the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Civil Defence personnel who lost his life was the only one who tried to display gallantry, but he paid with his life because he could not listen when the military, police and his colleague warned him to go into hiding. The response rate from the security guards was not encouraging at all.\n\n\u201cInside the prison was completely empty in the morning because virtually all inmates escaped. From what I gathered, one of the terrorists had broken into the office they keep files and destroyed or burnt them not to trace any record about them. I also gathered that they made an attempt to break into Abba Kyari\u2019s cell but it was difficult for him,\u201d he explained.\n\nAsked why the army responded too late and equally failed to act on the security report, the Defence Minister said: \u201cIf people give timely intelligence at the right time, I am sure we would have reacted promptly. But when it is not coming at the time you don\u2019t expect us to react. There is every likelihood that the situation is going to be interpreted on the basis of being quick or slow. From what we discussed now, I am sure that every security agent that came to Kuje Prison participated in every way possible to ensure that the prisoners did not escape. Our happiness is that many of them have been recaptured. There was reinforcement because the Brigade of Guards was fully in charge,\u201d he said.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Shauib Belgore, explained that out of over 950 inmates in Kuje Correctional Centre, over 600 of them escaped adding that over 300 have been recaptured.\n\nNCoS\u2019 spokesman, Mr Abubakar Umar, in a statement, said the attackers broke into the facility using explosive devices through the main entrance and the fence of the facility respectively.\n\nHe confirmed that an NSCDC personnel was killed adding that three personnel of the NCoS were seriously injured. The slain officer identified as Inspector Ilyasu Abraham was deployed to the correctional facility three years ago.\n\nUmar said the service would deploy its Corrections Information Management System (CIMS) in synergy with National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to track all fleeing inmates and return them to custody.\n\nHe also confirmed that DCP Abba Kyari and other VIPs held in the facility did not escape adding that they were presently in custody, hale and hearty.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Kuje Area Council have recounted their experiences, revealing that they saw sporadic shooting and inmates escaping in droves.\n\nA resident whose house is a few metres away from the prison yard told Daily Sun that while some of the escaping inmates were shot on the legs to demobilise them, other stranded ones were picked.\n\nStill struggling to overcome the trauma of the incident, a prison staff who was on duty during the attack told Daily Sun that a terrorist inmate had offered to accommodate them in his cell, but he rejected the offer and resorted to prayers for rescue.\n\n\u201cWe prayed like never before and God answered our prayers because the attackers broke almost all the rooms except our own. How we survived is still a surprise to me,\u201d the officer narrated.\n\nSpeaking when he visited the Centre, FCT Minister, Mohammed Musa Bello, ordered the Gomo of Kuje, Haruna Tanko Jibrin, to immediately summon meeting of village heads in and around the Area Council to ensure that no foreigner infiltrated the community and to fish out such person if it happens.\n\nThe minister, who visited the Correctional Service and was shown round the damaged facilities by the Controller General said he visited to see for himself the extent of damage done by the terrorists.\n\n\u2022Security beefup\n\nSecurity has been tightened in most parts of Kuje communities. Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) who went round the area, observed heavy security presence with fierce-looking armed personnel in areas considered as flash points.\n\nArmoured tanks have been positioned around Kuje Prison junction, while various teams of security personnel in siren-blaring vehicles patrol the area.\n\nThe Police, in conjunction with other security operatives, have cordoned off the roads leading to the prison area and movements have been restricted in the area.\n\n\u2022Police deploy special force\n\nThe Inspector of Police, Usman Alkali, has ordered deployment of the Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unit, forensic experts and other special forces to speedily get to the root of the incident and ensure culprits were brought to book.\n\nPolice Spokesman, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, said all relevant security agencies were working tirelessly to unravel circumstances surrounding it.\n\n\u2022US issues security alert to nationals\n\nRegardless, the United States Government has alerted its nationals has issued security advisory to its citizens.\n\nThe United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, in a July 6 security notice on its website, said: \u201cOn the night of July 5, 2022, an attack on Kuje Prison freed a large portion of the estimated 1,000 prisoners. The prison lies approximately 27 miles southwest of the Central Business District.\u201d\n\nThe United States further said an increase in crime is expected in and around Abuja, while also saying that \u201cit is recommended that U.S. citizens should maintain a high state of personal security awareness for the next two weeks and avoid unnecessary travel on the airport road.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United States, \u201cCrime is endemic throughout Nigeria and tends to spike after dark. Avoiding locations and situations that increase the likelihood of being victimized is the best defense. Avoid displays of valuables and limit nighttime activity.\u201d\n\nThe United States added that terrorist groups and those inspired by such organisations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.); hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists; places of worship, schools, parks, shopping malls and markets, public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights),\u201d the United States said.\n\nAmongst other precautions, the United States cautioned its nationals to be aware of their surroundings, keep a low profile, carry proper identification, monitor local media for updates and review personal security plans.",

Avoid displays of valuables and limit nighttime activity.\u201d\n\nThe United States added that terrorist groups and those inspired by such organisations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.); hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists; places of worship, schools, parks, shopping malls and markets, public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights),\u201d the United States said.\n\nAmongst other precautions, the United States cautioned its nationals to be aware of their surroundings, keep a low profile, carry proper identification, monitor local media for updates and review personal security plans.\n\nKuje: UK warns nationals on safety, security in Nigeria\n\nFrom Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK), has warned British citizens in Nigeria about their safety and security in the country.\n\nThe United Kingdom, in its Foreign Travel Advice on Nigeria, said on July 5, 2022, the Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital Territory was bombed and attacked by gunmen and an unknown number of prisoners have escaped.\n\nThe British Government said: \u201cYou should be extra vigilant if in the area.\u201d\n\nThe United Kingdom further said on June 5, 2022, there was a gun attack at a church in Owo, Ondo State, causing at least 40 deaths.\n\n\u201cThe High Commission are in contact with the local authorities. If you are in the area, you should monitor local media, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities,\u201d the United Kingdom said.\n\nThe United Kingdom further said since August 9, 2021, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South East region of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cProtests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, remain likely in the South East region. There have been reports of violence during Stay at Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South East and South South regions of Nigeria, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi. Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews,\u201d the UK said.\n\n\u2026Resign now, HURIWA, ADC tell Buhari\n\nWorried by the rising insecurity, civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) and presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, claimed the Buhari administration and the military were cool with the spate of terrorist attacks in the country as they have failed to deploy the 12 Super Tucano fighter jets against terrorists turning the country into another Afghanistan.\n\nKachikwu in a statement, released to journalists in Abuja, yesterday, said the attack on the convoy of the President on its way to Daura, Katsina State and simultaneous attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, were clear signs that the country is now faced with a grave security threat.\n\nHe wondered who then is safe if the President\u2019s convoy can be attacked as well as the Kuje Prison, which is just a few kilometers to the seat of power.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of an Oyo State High Court, sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, has fixed Tuesday, July 26, 2022 for judgment in the suit filed by the deputy governor of the state, Rauf Olaniyan, against the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, the House of Assembly and the clerk of the assembly, to stop impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nThe matter came up for hearing of the originating summons before the court yesterday, during which the leading counsel to the parties adopted their written addresses and made their final submissions.\n\nThe counsel are Chief Afolabi Fashanu (SAN) for the deputy governor, who is the claimant in the litigation, and Otunba Kunle Kalejaiye (SAN), for the defendants. The defendants in the matter are the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly (first defendant), Oyo State House of Assembly (second defendant), and the Clerk of the House of Assembly (third defendant). Before the adoption of final written addresses of the counsel, a member of Oyo State House of Assembly, Lateef Adebunmi, representing Orelope state constituency, through his lawyer, Sunday Aborishade, filed an application to join the suit as a co-defendant.\n\nBut Kalajaiye put up a vehement objection against it on the grounds that the court had a short time to hear the case and that the application was a delay tactic, which he said was immaterial to the suit. The court went into recess and on resumption, Justice Akintola said the applicant could be entertained based on certain grounds. But Fashanu also told the court that the Oyo State House of Assembly held a plenary yesterday, and a motion was raised, which was duly supported. The motion was for the Chief Judge of the state, Justice Munta Abimbola, to set up a seven-man committee to investigate the allegations raised against the deputy governor, which kick-started the impeachment process. But the judge held that the issues before the court be focused on.\n\nBut the court was silent on the order for the status quo to remain, which it gave last Tuesday, pending the hearing of the case, though the order was extended from Tuesday to yesterday.\n\nTwenty-four lawmakers had levelled five allegations against Olaniyan, bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office and official duty, as well as insubordination and other offences.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the proceedings, Kalejaiye said the status quo that the court ordered was still intact as Olaniyan remains the deputy governor. He added that the order subsisted till the hearing of the case, and the case had been heard.\n\nHe stated that Section 188 of the 1999 Constitution empowers the lawmakers to remove governor or deputy governor by following eight steps. The House of Assembly, he said, is not an inferior tribunal to the judiciary, as the three arms of government have coordinate power. He added that the judiciary does not have power to stop the House of Assembly from carrying out its assigned constitutional roles.\n\nBut Fashanu said the order for status quo to be maintained would subsist till the judgment is delivered on July 26. He also said the action of the House of Assembly, directed at the Chief Judge, to set up an investigative panel on the allegations against the deputy governor would be challenged legally, because the court order against had not been vacated at the time the directive was given. The court, according to him, is to serve as checks to other arms of government under the principle of separation of power.",

          "text": "By Olusegun Adeniyi\n\n\u201cThe committee invited editors of THISDAY newspaper because of the prominence which they have given to the publication of the allegations. The editors of THISDAY visited us informally, refusing to oblige our invitation and informing us that they would rely on their publications.\u201d\n\nThe excerpted quote is from the \u2018Report of the ad-hoc committee set up on Tuesday 21st September 1999 by the Lagos State House of Assembly to investigate the allegation of perjury and forgery levelled against the executive governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019. It was one of the documents attached to the 16th June 2022 letter by the Centre for Reform Advocacy which asked the Inspector General of Police to initiate criminal proceedings against Tinubu on grounds of alleged perjury in his 1999 Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Form CF 001.\n\nLet me say three things very quickly. One, I was among those unnamed editors of THISDAY in the Lagos assembly report. Instead of testifying before the panel as requested, we visited the chairman of the committee, Hon Jide Omoworare (who later became a Senator from Osun State) in his office. We explained to him that our information had already been published and we would stand by those reports. Two, I authored the 29th August 1999 cover story for THISDAY, The Sunday Newspaper, that blew open the scandal. It was titled, \u2018From Toronto to Chicago: The Case of Bola Tinubu\u2019. Three, these allegations predated the advent of social media, so it was possible for the national newspapers to conspire and kill any story at the time.\n\nAlthough I have decided not to begin my series on the presidential candidates until later in the year, I believe I should set this record straight. A WhatsApp message being circulated implies that certain journalists have ignored the \u2018story\u2019 contained in Tinubu\u2019s INEC form where he did not list the primary and secondary schools he attended. Since all the journalists being vilified by the writer are Yoruba, the implication is ethnic motivation resulting in a conspiracy of silence. The writer did not include my name, but I cannot count the number of people who have forwarded the piece to me. Some ask why I have \u2018refused to write about Tinubu\u2019s certificates\u2019. To the few that deserved my response, I told them the issue had been over-flogged by the media in the past. However, it is important to refresh the memory of those who may have forgotten as well as those who were either not born or too young to understand what transpired.\n\nShortly after the inauguration of the National Assembly and the election of Salisu Imam Buhari as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1999, TheNews magazine published an expose that Buhari did not attend the University of Toronto, Canada, as claimed in the sworn affidavit attached to his INEC form. Among other allegations, the most damaging was that Buhari was born in January 1970 which then put his age at 29. Since section 65(1) of the 1999 Constitution at the time disqualified anyone below the age of 30 from running for election to the House, it meant that Buhari\u2019s speakership was resting on nothing. On 23rd July 1999, following pressure from the House that had set up a committee to investigate the allegations, Buhari resigned. He was subsequently charged for perjury, convicted and then pardoned by President Olusegun Obasanjo. What followed was a floodgate of allegations about the dodgy credentials being paraded by several other politicians. That was how the allegations against Tinubu surfaced.\n\nAll the papers I received were from a source I was almost certain had given them to other journalists as well. As a responsible media house, we of course needed to verify the claims before publishing. I enlisted the support of Waziri Adio, who had just returned from the United States (where he was THISDAY\u2019s New York Bureau Chief) with a master\u2019s degree in Journalism from the University of Columbia. Waziri was the person who emailed and received the first responses from American institutions about Tinubu\u2019s qualifications.\n\nWe investigated all the allegations. The reporter we sent to Government College, Ibadan met the principal who told him that only the then Oyo State Governor, the late Lam Adesina, could compel the school to respond to our inquiry. We took that as an affirmation that Tinubu did not attend the school. Did he attend the University of Chicago? A response to Waziri\u2019s mail by their Director of Communication, Mr Larry Albeiter, said such a name could not be found in their records. That also told us something. Did Tinubu participate in the mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme? We confirmed that he served at Haboni Engineering Company, Ibadan in the 1982/83 batch and we obtained a copy of his NYSC discharge certificate, number, OY/FORN/82/9106. Did he attend Chicago State University? A quick response came that Tinubu graduated from the school. We also got his Chartered Public Accountant (CPA) record and the years he obtained different qualifications.\n\nTo cut a long story short, when we thought we had our story of false claims about aspects of his INEC form, Waziri and I sought appointment to see the governor. We met him at a Lagos State government guest house in GRA, Ikeja. He was with his then all-powerful Chief of Staff, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the current Information and Culture Minister. It was only the four of us: Myself, Waziri, Tinubu and Mohammed. In the more than one hour we spent at the session, we asked Tinubu all questions pertaining to his education from primary school to university. It is an interaction I will never forget and will certainly form part of my memoir when I write one. Perhaps being a lawyer, Alhaji Lai Mohammed made our job rather difficult with his interjections. So irritated was Waziri that, at one point, he snapped: \u201cSir, will you please allow the governor to speak for himself?\u201d\n\nWhile still attempting to establish the veracity of the allegations, TODAY, an Abuja-based weekly newspaper owned by the late Abadina Coomasie, (brother of the former Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Coomasie) ran a report titled, \u2018Tinubu in Fraud Sensation\u2019. But the story was more an attack on the ubiquitous \u2018Southwest media\u2019 that the paper claimed had resolved not to publish the Tinubu allegations, unlike the way we treated the Salisu Buhari saga. A sectional tone permeated the report. When I eventually wrote my story on Tinubu, I referenced the fact that \u201cthe document on which TODAY based its story had been sent to virtually all media houses in Lagos and THISDAY on receiving a copy had commenced investigation.\u201d\n\nOn reflection, even the intro to my story was somehow defensive: \u201cAside falsifying his age, Salisu Buhari, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, lost his office and seat to the claim that he attended University of Toronto, Canada when he never did. Now, Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, is facing a similar allegation that borders on another foreign university, this time in Chicago, United States. Olusegun Adeniyi, who has been following the development, reports.\u201d There were a series of other reports and backpage columns on the issue with Waziri writing three, including the one savaging the Yoruba establishment and the other taking on the media, titled \u201cThe Hypocrisy of the Ngbati Press\u201d. I also wrote two backpage columns, including \u201cIn the Beginning Was Toronto.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, our chairman, Mr Nduka Obaigbena, was abroad at this period but as it so ever happened, we used him as a shield and despite the pressure on him, he did not interfere in any of our reports. Of course, it was not easy for us, because of the backlash we also received at a period Tinubu was very popular given the role he played in the pro-democracy struggles during the military era which ended only a few months before. These, of course, are tales for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things followed my story and subsequent publications (not only by THISDAY but also by other media houses, especially The Source magazine, published by Ms Comfort Obi) on the Tinubu saga. One was political and the other legal. On the political front, the Omoworare panel was established by the Lagos State House of Assembly as part of possible impeachment proceedings. The Speaker of that House, by the way, is Dr Olorunnibe Mamora, the current Minister of State for Health. On the legal front, the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN, went to court to charge Tinubu for perjury. That case went as far as the Supreme Court where it was resolved in 2002 that Tinubu, by virtue of constitutional immunity, could only be investigated but not prosecuted. At that time, Tinubu had a formidable legal team headed by his Attorney General and Justice Commissioner, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, the current Vice President of Nigeria.\n\nAt the House of Assembly, Tinubu went with his lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, while Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, who took responsibility for the \u2018error\u2019 in the form, appeared with Prof Itse Sagay, SAN. Several other lawyers were invited by the House, including Mr Olisa Agbakoba, SAN, who contended that while Tinubu could not be tried because he had immunity, the House had the power to impeach him if they concluded that he had committed perjury. Aside from the late Fawehinmi who argued before the House that Tinubu had indeed committed perjury and should suffer the same fate as Salisu Buhari, other lawyers countered that the governor had not done anything to warrant impeachment.\n\nAt the end, the House came up with six issues for determination: allegations of perjury, allegation of forgery, comparison between Salisu Buhari and Tinubu, possible impeachment, NYSC primary assignment and immunity. They resolved all these issues in Tinubu\u2019s favour, before they concluded: \u201cSince the governor himself accepted responsibility for the \u2018needless errors\u2019 made, and in any event, he is responsible for documents signed by him, we strongly advised him to be more careful in ensuring the accuracy of documents that carry his signature in future.\u201d\n\nWhile Tinubu survived both the impeachment scare and the court case by the late Fawehinmi, he faced enormous challenges while seeking re-election in 2003. By then there was no love lost between him and President Obasanjo. Besides, the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with Chief Olabode George as Deputy National Chairman was determined to take Lagos. As he has done now, Tinubu only filed his Chicago State University in the space for education, leaving out his primary and secondary schools. He also survived all legal and political battles and won his re-election in 2003.\n\nOn the whole, I doubt if any politician has faced as much scrutiny as Tinubu over the past two decades. Most of what people now \u201cknow\u201d about his alleged Iragbiji (Osun State) heritage, the names he reportedly bore when he was young etc. were written by journalists. A simple Google search will give anybody hundreds of different accounts about Tinubu\u2019s parentage, age and other allegations. So, for me, journalism has discharged its obligation. If Tinubu is still so politically relevant that he could win the presidential primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) against all odds and 15 years after he left office\u2014and lost immunity from criminal prosecution\u2014guilt-tripping people along ethnic lines when the journalists that established these claims were also Yoruba, makes no sense.\n\nBefore I hazard a guess as to what I consider the issue in the Tinubu story, let me state what it is not about. Given our findings 23 years ago, this is not about a lack of higher education. You don\u2019t get recruited by Deloitte from an American campus without being a cut above the rest. Tinubu\u2019s record at Chicago State University is indeed impeccable. On 28th May 1979, for instance, a letter signed by Andrew F. Sikila, from the Office of Dean, College of Business and Administration, reads: \u201cI recommend that Bola A. Tinubu, a student in the College of Business and Administration be the recipient of the Outstanding Senior Award. Mr. Tinubu exhibits qualities of an ideal student: he shows strong leadership abilities as President of the Accounting Society, and he is an excellent student. In my interaction with this student, I have found him to be inspirational to other students and interested in their problems. It is with pleasure that I recommend Bola A. Tinubu to receive the Outstanding Senior Award.\u201d\n\nNow, what is this all about? I believe, as most reasonable people do, that there is a deliberate omission about Tinubu\u2019s early life in his INEC form that raises serious questions for which he must be ready to provide answers. And if he doesn\u2019t, his opponents can seek legal option, use it for campaign purposes or make it an issue during the presidential debates we must have before the election. What primary and secondary schools did Tinubu attend? This is a legitimate question to ask of someone who seeks to be the president of Nigeria without denigrating the work that some people did more than two decades ago, (which is already in the public domain) or unfairly insinuating ethnic cover-up or bias\u2014something that is unfortunately becoming a dangerous part of the 2023 campaigns.\n\nInterestingly, 21 years ago, I dealt with an issue like this in a case of art imitating life, following receipt of a novel from my egbon and Lagos lawyer, Mr Edo Ukpong tiitled, \u2018The Incumbent\u2019. The narrative defines the responsibility of a journalist and the role of others, especially in the political process. I recalled the piece in a recent special edition publication by THISDAY Editorial Board. I commend it to readers as my last word on this matter: The Reporter and the Candidate \u2013 THISDAYLIVE\n\nThe Passage of Barkindo\n\nI doubt if anything can be more harrowing than for an aged mother to open the veil covering the face of a deceased prominent son and begin to invoke powerful prayers. That was what happened yesterday in Yola, Adamawa State where the remains of the late Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo were laid to rest. Although Barkindo\u2019s mother appeared strong as she prayed on the corpse of her son who died at 63, many of the people in the room could not hold back tears. The same happened at the palace of the Lamido of Adamawa where the Janazah prayer was held for the deceased.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the Adamawa State capital stood still yesterday for Barkindo, and most people had positive stories to tell about him. On our way to Yola with Barkindo\u2019s remains, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Alhaji Yayale Ahmed and the ADC to the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Brigadier General Mustapha Onoyiveta (rtd) recounted their interactions with him in the hours preceding his sudden death on Tuesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife, as William Shakespeare reminded us in Macbeth, is no more than a \u201cwalking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more.\u201d From all accounts, Barkindo played his part well before he exited the stage. May God grant his family the fortitude to bear this most painful loss.\n\n\n\n2022 Teens Conference Registration\n\nRegistration for the 2022 edition of the annual Teens Career Conference of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), The Everlasting Arms Parish (TEAP) Abuja has commenced. With the theme, \u2018Why Tomorrow\u2019s Leaders Must Begin Today\u2019, the speakers are Samson Itodo, Executive Director, YIAGA-Africa and member of the Kofi Annan Foundation Board, Linda Ejiofor-Suleiman, an award-winning actress and\n\nmodel, and Seun Onigbinde, a social entrepreneur, open data analyst and co-founder/CEO of budgIT.

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would shut down a few months later, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nIn June 2021, Mucunguzi incorporated Vanoma. Building off of the solution he activated at Nisawa, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they are prompted to geolocate themselves. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the seller. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in November, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s agricultural output in the second half of this year is expected to slow on the back of flooding and the continued surge in input costs, which have compounded the challenges facing farmers.\n\nIndustry experts who spoke to BusinessDay lamented that Nigerian farmers are still contending with escalating insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to them, the high cost of farm inputs, insecurity, and climate change is responsible for rising food prices in Africa\u2019s most populous country, making it increasingly hard for Nigerian households to buy tomatoes, rice, beans, and other staple foods.\n\n\u201cIn the second half, there appears to be pending disaster because we do not have any reserve, and food prices are going higher and higher with no hope of ever coming down as the inputs required for optimum production are also getting more expensive by the day,\u201d said Ibrahim Kabiru, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria.\n\nRead also: Higher input costs claim 88.7% of livestock feed revenue in Q1\n\n\u201cFertiliser is going for a minimum of N18,500 for 20:10:10, while 15:15:15 is going for 27,000 and Urea is about 30,000 and still counting. How can farmers survive with this,\u201d he asked.\n\nThe 20:10:10 and 20:15:15 are the NPK fertiliser blends mostly used by smallholder farmers across the country.\n\nThe high cost of key inputs such as seeds, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilisers across the country has continued to frustrate farmers, a development experts say may threaten the country\u2019s production and the diversification drive of the government.\n\n\u201cI do not see the sector doing better in the second half than it did in the first half. Prices of fertilisers and other inputs such as herbicides, and pesticides have doubled and this will lead to further increase in food prices,\u201d said Abiodun Olorundenro, operations manager at AquaShoots.\n\nAccording to Olorundenro, skyrocketing prices of inputs are already discouraging many farmers from planting on a large expanse of land as many cannot afford the required input costs.\n\nApart from surging input costs, the farmers also based their pessimism on the recent prediction of the Nigeria Hydrological Services.\n\nKabiru said farmers are also worried about the threat flood incidence might bring in the second half. \u201cWe are fearful of the flood outlook released by the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, which says flood will affect 32 states, and the food system will be severely challenged further,\u201d he said.\n\nSuleiman Adamu, minister of water resources, had in early May said high flooding would hit 233 Local Government Areas in 32 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to him, eight states will battle with tidal surges and rise in sea level in 2022 based on the 2022 Annual Flood Outlook for the country. \u201cRivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Lagos, Ogun and Ondo will experience coastal flooding due to tidal surge and rise in sea level,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to experts, when severe floods occur, farmers incur huge losses as their crops get submerged beyond a level they could thrive. Fungal diseases usually become more rampant when extensive flooding overtakes farms.\n\n\u201cThe current situation in the sector is not gloomy at all, and this would affect our production in the second. The country will also experience further increase in prices of food,\u201d African Farmer Mogaji, chief executive of X-Ray Consulting, said.\n\nDespite the numerous challenges in the sector, it grew by 3.16 percent in the first quarter of 2022 in real terms, higher by 0.88 percent when compared to the corresponding period in 2021. The sector contributed 22.21 percent to the total growth recorded for the period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show.\n\nAgricultural export for the first quarter grew by 58.35 percent to N202 billion from N127 billion in the corresponding period of 2021. The growth was driven by cocoa and sesame exports for the period.\n\nSome industry experts questioned the NBS data for the growth recorded by the sector in the first half, stressing that the challenges that impacted the sector debilitated agricultural production.\n\n\u201cAt times you wonder where NBS gets their data from. Our production has been on the decline, and many farmers cannot go to their farms and the data is still saying the sector grew, how?\u201d Kabiru said.",

          "text": "As terrorism, banditry and kidnapping continue to escalate, farmers in Nigeria are forced to abandon their farms in many parts of the country.\n\nSince the security situation became intense a few years ago, many farmers have fled to safety, and a number of agribusinesses have gone under after the destruction of their facilities.\n\nRead also: Boko Haram conflict cuts Nigeria wheat crop as farmers flee\n\nThe situation has hampered the country\u2019s ability to diversify through agriculture and generates substantial foreign exchange through the sector despite its potential.\n\n\u201cLots of farmers have abandoned their farmlands for fear of being kidnapped,\u201d said Ibrahim Kabiru, national president of All Farmers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFarmers should be able to carry out their farming activities without any form of fear and harvest without having to pay bandits. These are crucial in preventing a food crisis,\u201d he added.\n\nThe situation has also continued to deter new agricultural investments in key crop-growing states while throwing existing agribusinesses in disarray.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that the capital imported into the agriculture sector in the first quarter of 2022 declined by 99.3 percent to $1.76 million from $237.83 million in the preceding quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have more local problems causing a surge in food prices than the Russian-Ukraine war. We have lost 60 percent of our food production in the northern region due to insecurity,\u201d said Edobong Akpabio, outgoing head of agribusiness at Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of farmers do not cultivate in places where they usually grow crops because of the high rate of insecurity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said insecurity must become a thing of the past before Nigeria could curtail the recent surge in food prices.\n\nFood prices in Africa\u2019s most populous country have surged by more than 50 percent from January to date over escalating insecurity, the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian- Ukraine war.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation hit 17.71 percent in May, while food inflation accelerated to 19.5 percent from 18.37 percent in April, driven by the rise in prices of staple foods across the country, according to the NBS.\n\n\u201cOur food production has not been growing in the past few years due to insecurity in the country. If we must tackle the high cost of food, we must address insecurity to tackle rising prices of food,\u201d Muda Yusuf, founder of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, said in a response to questions.\n\nGrowth in the agricultural sector has been inconsistent and slowing since the fourth quarter of 2020, before it surprisingly rose to 3.58 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and slowed to 3.16 percent in the first quarter of 2022, according to NBS data.\n\nApart from insecurity, climate change has also adversely impacted food production in the country.\n\nChanging climate patterns are negatively impacting farmers\u2019 productivity, leading to a low output that cannot meet the demand of 200 million people, thus resulting in demand overshooting supply.\n\nAfricanFarmer Mogaji, chief executive officer of X-Ray Consulting Limited, said climate change had become a critical issue for smallholder farmers and that the impact on agriculture was becoming more intense.\n\n\u201cIt will be a major determinant of food production. Africa\u2019s vulnerability to climate change is closely linked to the continent\u2019s low adaptive capacity and increasing dependence on resources sensitive to changes in climate,\u201d he said.",

They want to look at the elements in the youths; that vibrancy\u2026. The Atiku/Okowa ticket will return power to the youths and appreciate the role and position of women\u201d.\n\nOn the capacity of Governor Okowa to galvanize votes for the PDP, Aniagwu said that beyond Okowa\u2019s acceptability, he valued consensus and does not run a one-man show.\n\n\u2018\u2019This means that Okowa will work with other leaders in the south and across the country to galvanize the voters. He believes that to have an inroad in Rivers State, for example, he will need leaders led by Wike to get the votes.\n\n\u2018\u2019Okowa will work with Wike very well. Okowa will also reach out to our brothers and sisters in the South-west and in the South-east which is already happening. The challenge at hand is not a one-man show\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nResponding to the northern/southern dichotomy in the emergence of Nigeria\u2019s next president, Mr Aniagwu enjoined Nigerians to move away from such divisive tendencies as purportedly encouraged by the current Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019We agree that the Buhari administration has not been able to open up our system for us to appreciate our diversity rather, they took advantage of this diversity in the wrong way. Atiku and Okowa will make this diversity work for us positively.\n\n\u2018\u2019Everybody knows Atiku as a man who is much detribalized and Okowa as a man who believes that everybody has a role to play irrespective of tribe. When you have these two individuals who are open and believe in the strength of everybody, it is an advantage.\n\n\u2018\u2019Development-wise, what we have done in Delta State and what Atiku did with former President Olusegun Obasanjo is enough for them to know that there is something new that is coming on the horizon\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe restructuring of 5 electricity distribution companies (DisCos) has vindicated Governor Obaseki investment in Ossiomo power plant. The Federal Government has announced the restructuring and take-over of 5 electricity distribution companies (DisCos) across the country by some banks in a move that might not be unconnected with their inability to meet up with the repayment of its debt obligations. This follows the activation of the call on the collateralized shares of Kano, Benin and Kaduna DisCos by Fidelity Bank with the initiation of action to take-over the boards of these DisCos and exercise rights on the shares.\n\nFollowing the takeover, Fidelity Bank informed the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) that it had activated the call on the collateralised shares of Kano, Benin and Kaduna DisCos with their acquisition loans in 2013, drawn from Fidelity and AFREXIM Bank.\n\nDue to the payment defaults, the bank said it initiated action to take over the Boards of these DisCos and exercise the rights on the shares. The authorities swiftly recognised the board and replaced Managing Directors of the DisCos as well as Ibadan and Port Harcourt DisCos too.\n\nEarlier this year, NERC had called for a restructuring of these distressed DisCos, including Jos, Benin, Kaduna and Kano, where the owners were also management officials. UBA had in December taken control of Abuja DisCo over default in the 2013 privatisation acquisition loan payment. The fresh actions are coming just five days into a new electricity market regime based on contractual obligations, activated by NERC on July 1st, to ensure 5,000 megawatts of electricity daily supply while sanctioning operators for default. Although, the target has not been met barely a week after, the actions are indicators of sanctions for the perennially backward DisCos, industry experts observed. According to BPE and NERC in the latest announcement, Fidelity Bank\u2019s action is a contractual and commercial intervention and is between the Core Investors in the DisCos and the lender. BPE is involved because of the 40% shareholding of government in the DisCos.\n\nThere is need for President Buhari to adopt Governor Obaseki\u2019s power model of power generation and distribution in Edo State. There is competition between Ossiomo and BEDC in Edo State. There is alternative electricity in Edo State today. Nigeria needs this model to solve the electricity challenge.\n\nIn June 2017, Governor Godwin Obaseki announced to the world that in six month\u2019s time, his administration would provide uninterrupted power supply to B\u00e9nin City and environs. According to his plans, government establishments on Sapele Road axis, including Government House, Secretariat, Court Complex, Central hospital, House of Assembly and also the Oba of B\u00e9nin Palace, will enjoy the 24 hours power supply.\n\nObaseki was quite assured that he would deliver on his promise in record time. He gave the assurance after he entered a power purchase agreement with Ossiomo Power and Infrastructure to bulk purchase the five megawatts the firm planned to generate from its 50 megawatts plant at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha local government area which BEDC has frustrated. The megawatts was expected to be transmitted on a new 35-kilometre double circuit 33Kva line to deliver 24/7 uninterrupted power.\n\nThe electricity market in Edo State is taking a turn for the better as increased competition among players has created options for reliable power supply to residents, who credit the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, for opening up the state for investment that has now improved their living standards.\n\nChecks in the Benin metropolis have revealed that the two major power distribution companies in the state, Benin Electricity Power Distribution Company (BEDC) and Ossiomo Power Company are in a fierce battle for the customers with the competition assuring better power options to residents.\n\nIt was discovered that with the improvement of distribution infrastructure by Ossiomo Power in select areas in the Benin metropolis, residents are opting for the company\u2019s power solution with the supply averaging 22-24hrs/day. \u201cThe industrial areas are even better served because they need electricity to keep the machines running, which is not what you get everywhere in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is great that BEDC, which used to dominate the market, now has a competitor. With this, we have a more stable market situation as people are now provided with options when considering power solutions in their homes or industries. Those who will benefit the most are industries, hotels, and others in the hospitality sector.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki had disclosed that Edo State has developed plans to help overcome the challenges of power distribution to industries, residential buildings and other users. BEDC has misunderstood this and trying to frustrate the effort of the governor in providing electricity to the people of Edo State. This includes building areas of use, that is, developing industrial parks, housing estates and other clusters that can be directly connected to generating plants.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen these plans are fully achieved, the state would have steady power supply to support businesses and other users. With time, Benin City and other towns in the state will be better planned and segregated so that industrial use of power can be separated from domestic use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen this is done, the structural challenges along the chain of generation and distribution will then be reorganised and steady power supply will then be guaranteed,\u201d he said. He explained that steady power supply cannot be achieved overnight until the structural impediments are addressed, noting, \u201cEven if the issue of generation of power is addressed, efforts must be made to address issues mitigating distribution and transmission.\u201d\n\nObaseki is setting new boundaries for power generation in Edo State which Benin Electricity DisCo (\u201cBEDC\u201d or \u201cBenin Disco\u201d) which is one of the successor distribution companies (DisCos) created following the unbundling and privatization of the state-owned Power Utility, Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc highly misunderstood. BEDC misunderstood Obaseki who has introduced systems approach to quantifying the value of power generation and energy storage technologies in future electricity networks. A new approach that required to determine a technology\u2019s value to the power systems of the 21st century. The centrepiece of the system value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy.\n\nBEDC since inception has not added any value to the Infrastructure it inherited which explains the poor and deteriorated state of the power infrastructure in this part of the country. \u201cThe BEDC personnel on the field are unprofessional in their conduct and openly engage the services of military personnel to intimidate and brutalise customers. Nigerians want to have improved access to power supply and industries want to have electricity to scale up production.\u201d\n\nObaseki had accused the BEDC of writing petitions against the deal sealed for the purchase of five megawatts of electricity to light up government offices in Benin City. The governor, who said the petitions have hindered the success of the purchase agreement, decried the poor supply of electricity to the state, the company\u2019s resolve not to supply pre-paid meters to electricity consumers and its culture of over-billing its clients.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201c195 communities have never seen electricity as BEDC is not ready to extend electricity to these communities. 128 communities have issues of collapse of infrastructure which BEDC is not prepared to fix. 219 transformers purchased by the state government and the former Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) as replacements for faulty transformers are yet to be installed by BEDC.\n\n\u201cThe people are over-billed with the estimated billing system of BEDC. We lost a student due to the negligence of BEDC, for refusing to fix a pole that was knocked down after receiving money to fix it. I have instructed the Attorney General of Edo State to file charges of criminal negligence against the senior management of BEDC,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nThe electricity sector in Edo State is undergoing an unprecedented transition which BEDC has failed to utilize. Today, Ossiomo power is providing affordable, secure and reliable electricity by attracting investors with low risk, stable returns. BEDC has not taken advantage of the liberal investment incentives here and improved power supply from Ossiomo. BEDC cannot provide electricity for industrial customers, for processing, producing, or assembling goods including diverse industries such as manufacturing, mining, agriculture.\n\nFidelity Bank and the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) have taken over the control of Kaduna, Benin, Kano and Ibadan Distribution Companies (DisCos) just as the federal government has restructured Port Harcourt DisCo to halt its crash.\n\n____________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald, Benin City inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Jonathan Lawani, who made the submission, said the active involvement of citizens in environmental regeneration is germane to maintaining a hygienic environment.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to appeal to the people of Edo State on the issue of waste management, cleanliness and erosion control. It must be a joint effort between the government and the citizenry. Whatever affects the state affects everybody that lives in it. People should take care of their immediate environment by clearing grasses and desilting drainages.\u201d\n\nLawani urged residents to desist from indiscriminate dumping of refuse, noting: \u201cWe have seen that some of our people now put their refuse in their vehicles and dump it by the expressway. This is not good for the state; it makes the city dirty and we have been doing everything possible to clean up.\n\n\u201cWe have different waste managers that take care of properties at homes and offices, and are now working jointly with local governments to make sure people pay for the waste they generate. We also have sweepers\u2019 waste evacuators that are specifically dedicated to our major roads where our sweepers are cleaning on a daily basis. We have another set dedicated to evacuating wastes in the markets.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Ministry is currently evacuating wastes from the various illegal dumpsites especially in Oluku and Ogheghe communities and steps are in place to solve the management issues in these areas permanently.\n\nOn flood control, he said preparations have been made to ensure that the effect is not as bad as have been projected by NiMET, noting, \u201cWe consciously carried out desilting of major drains across Benin City between December up to the month of February. We had to desilt these drains and other minor drains within Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe have also constructed ponds in some locations.

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "The United States Embassy has warned its citizens in Nigeria against travelling on the road leading to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Lugbe, Abuja.\n\nThe warning came after suspected terrorists attacked Kuje prison and freed inmates on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, United Kingdom citizens were warned not to be cautious of travelling to 19 states in Nigeria.\n\nAmong the states are Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River.\n\nThey were advised to only embark on essential travel to Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa , Niger, Sokoto, Kogi, within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State, Abia and non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Plateau, and Taraba.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, titled, \u2018Abuja FCT prison break near the airport on July 5, 2022\u2019, the US Embassy noted that crime has become endemic throughout Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn the night of July 5, 2022, an attack on Kuje Prison freed a large portion of the estimated 1,000 prisoners. The prison lies approximately 27 miles southwest of the Central Business District.\n\n\u201cAn increase in crime is expected in and around Abuja. It is recommended that U.S. citizens should maintain a high state of personal security awareness for the next two weeks and avoid unnecessary travel on the airport road.\n\n\u201cCrime is endemic throughout Nigeria and tends to spike after dark. Avoiding locations and situations that increase the likelihood of being victimized is the best defence. Avoid displays of valuables and limit nighttime activity.\n\n\u201cTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\n\u201cHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.), hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists, places of worship, schools, parks, shopping malls and markets and public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights).\n\n\u201cActions to take: Be aware of your surroundings, Keep a low profile, carry proper identification, monitor local media for updates, review your personal security plans, always drive with your windows rolled up and the doors locked, and avoid large gatherings and protests, review alternative travel routes in case of unexpected protests or unrest, exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests, always keep the doors to your residence locked, even when at home\u201d, the statement read.",

It is wrong to mix up terrorists with politically exposed persons, and ordinary suspects.\u201d\n\nThe former army chief noted that he had set up a committee to determine how to prosecute the terrorists, but cannot say what happened to the report of the committee.\n\n\u201cWe set up a committee that went round the prisons to profile the suspects to determine how to prosecute them because most of them had no information we could use to charge them to court. I don\u2019t know what happened to the report of committee,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe response time was a major failure by security agencies. The terrorists had been their for over a decade presumably undergoing deradicalisation. Our prisons are unsuitable and ill-equipped some over 100 years ago like the Port Harcourt prison.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Burkati Bulama, a public affairs analyst and senior researcher in institute of defense, UK, said the incident is an attack on the security system in the country, which according to him, has completely collapsed.\n\n\u201cThese people have been saying that they will come to rescue those people in several videos. The attackers did not fall from the sky: they moved from somewhere to the prisons with all their logistics without detection; carried out the operation for three hours and returned to their based uninterrupted,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Boko Haram has become more dangerous because they now have cells everywhere, from where they now launch attacks. This year alone, they gave attacked Kogi four times, Taraba state, Yobe twice, etc. It is signal that nowhere in Nigeria is safe and they are spreading.

          "text": "Dare-devil gunmen of the dreaded ISWAP terrorist group, on Tuesday night, around 10pm, laid siege to the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Kuje area of Abuja, attacking the facility with explosive devices and sophisticated assault weapons.\n\nThe gunmen numbering about 300 according to eyewitnesses, rode motorcycles invading multiple military and police checkpoints in the city to successfully overpower a garrison of the Nigeria Army personnel and a contingent of Police formation who were deployed to provide perimeter security for the facility which holds high profile convicts and dangerous criminals awaiting trial.\n\nResidents of the sleepy town raised alarm around 10:20pm Tuesday night when they started hearing gunshots and explosions that shook windows and curtails blinds. They scampered for safety and fled for their lives in the attack that many initially thought was targeted at residents of Elrufai Estate in Kuje.\n\nNSCDC officer killed in defence of facility\n\nThe attackers invaded the facility with high calibre weapons, maiming, burning and bombing their way through obstacles and attempts by armed personnel on duty to repel the attack.\n\nAt the end of the siege, a statement by the Correctional Service Public Relations Officer, Umar Abubakar, revealed that a total of 879 inmates escaped from the facility, though 443 have been recaptured. 551 inmates are currently in the facility with four inmates dead and 16 inmates sustaining various degrees of injuries and are being treated at the moment.\n\nAn officer of the NSCDC also paid the supreme price, while at least eight officers of the Nigeria Correctional Service sustained various degrees of injuries.\n\nKuje has experienced a high level of insecurity in recent months. Kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery and ritual killings are now common place. Just two weeks ago, the body of Hussani Aliyu Takuma, was recovered by the police from his farm after he was brutally murdered.\n\nThe Nigerian Police and Military have since doubled their personnel stationed in and around Kuje, and other adjourning satellite town coming into Abuja.\n\nHowever, the attackers of the Kuje Correctional Facility in their numbers evaded the watchful eyes of the security apparatchik, operated for an hour and escaped arrest by the state.\n\nAfter the attack on the Nigerian Correctional Centre in Abolongo in Oyo town of Oyo State, the leadership of the Ministry of Interior which supervises the agency, directed that all Custodial facilities in the country be fortified by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC.) It also wrote and sought the cooperation of the Nigeria Army and the Nigeria Police Force to provide additional security coverage of the facilities across the country.\n\nStationed permanently at the Kuje Correctional Centre are Armoured Tank, platoons of soldiers, Mobile Police Operatives, with armed officers of NSCDC, men of the Department of State Security and NCoS providing support on perimeter security.\n\nAt the time of attack, 38 military personnel were on ground in addition to men of the Nigeria Police, Civil Defence, DSS and armed squad of the Correctional Service.\n\nDefence Minister, Bashir Magashi, who supervises the military and other top government officials paid an inspection visit to the centre on Wednesday, stating that the attackers came in with high explosives to attack a section of the perimeter wall.\n\n\u201cThe incident took about 30 minutes, then reinforcements arrived. The inmates here are about 994. And when they broke out, because this people came specifically, we understand they are Boko Haram, they came specifically for their co-conspirators, in order to get them, they broke out other people in the general population so they can escape,\u201d the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Mgashi (rtd) was quoted as saying.\n\nA security expert and retired intelligence officer, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, noted that the attack on the Kuje Custodial facility goes beyond the ability of the Nigerian state to properly secure inmates, but calls to question, the entire security architecture of the Nigerian State.\n\n\u201cI understand the Guards Brigade takes charge of the security of the seat of power. Even whilst driving into Kuje, Kubwa, Gwagwalada and its environs, you see them setting up check points, so how are the attackers able to sneak in with their weapons undetected and leave unscratched?

It was at this point that the permission for an air strike was given.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the location was struck by NAF aircraft in successive passes with scores of unsuspecting terrorists eliminated.\n\n\u201cFortunately, as had been anticipated, the hostages were later seen escaping after the successful Air Interdiction by the NAF aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of the airstrike was that some of the villagers who had dispersed when the terrorists first invaded the village were seen returning.\n\n\u201cThe villagers also confirmed that over 24 terrorists were eliminated in the carefully planned and coordinated air strikes,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe added that a similar success was also recorded elsewhere in the same local government area as intelligence reports received in the evening of July 5, 2022 had revealed that some terrorists with herds of cattle were observed dispersed in Abdulkareem Camp near Mahuta village in Safana local government area of the State.\n\nAbdulkareem, is a well-known terrorist kingpin, and has been a source of kidnapping and killings of innocent citizens residing near Mahuta village and environs.\n\n\u201cConsequently, a NAF aircraft was dispatched to the general area where it remained overhead the Area of Interest until the early hours of July 6, 2022 when the first human was sighted.\n\n\u201cAfter sighting about 18 terrorists amassing within the location, the aircraft engaged the targets. The fall of shot was observed within the compound and the impact radius of the blast was effective on other terrorists hiding in the compound.\n\n\u201cFeedback received has indicated that the strikes were precise and successful.\n\n\u201cEfforts remain ongoing to locate and decimate other terrorists\u2019 locations within Katsina and the entire Northwest,\u201d he stated.",

          "title": "Investigation: How intelligence failure, insiders\u2019 conspiracy led to Kuje jailbreak",
          "text": "Indications emerged Wednesday how insiders\u2019 conspiracy within the security apparatus especially in the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) and failure of intelligence led to Tuesday\u2019s evening attack on the Kuje Maximum Prison, leaving five persons, including four inmates and one Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officer dead.\n\nThree NCS personnel were also confirmed to be seriously injured.\n\nThe daring terrorists were said to have operated successfully for about three hours and got 879 inmates escaped from the facility.\n\nThe centre came under severe bomb attacks which destroyed a good chunk of the facility that reportedly houses no fewer than 1500 inmates serving various jail terms while the majority were awaiting trial inmates.\n\nAn impeccable source said some suspected insurgents had in their hundreds, first bombed the facility before others emerged in droves from the immediate environment to lay siege and shot at the handful of unwary security operatives on duty to scare them.\n\nThey also fired at scampering inmates who sought to escape from the facility and in the process six of them fell to the sustained gun assaults as the gunmen sprayed bullets on anything moving or suspected to stand in their way.\n\nOne of Blueprint correspondents who visited the scene of the dreaded attack gathered that some soldiers deployed to the Correctional Centre\u2019s environment, who had mastered the terrain, were moved out and redeployed 24 hours before the terrorists attacked Kuje Prison.\n\nThe source, a top security source in the know of the happening within the centre, confided in Blueprint that while the soldiers were removed, new ones were yet to arrive before the terrorists struck.\n\nThis, however, could not be verified as at the time of this report.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThere are insiders\u2019 sabotage in Kuje attack that government needs to investigate very well.\u201d\n\nThe source who refused to speak more on what he described as \u201csabotage\u201d wondered how the terrorists were able to beat intelligence and checkpoints mounted by security agencies through the use of motorcycles.\n\nRoll call\n\nIt was further gathered that as at 2.00am Tuesday morning when the situation was relatively brought under control and the roll call of inmates was taken, only about 111 out of the about 1500 in the custodian centre were available.\n\nHowever, by Wednesday at about 2.00pm when another roll call was taken, a little over 300 hundred escapees were either recaptured or voluntarily returned to the facility.\n\n\u201cYes, some inmates returned on their own but some were recaptured, especially those that are not really familiar with the environment and others who could not find safety in their hiding places.\n\n\u201cDuring the roll call, we also discovered that apart from the six dead, between 10 to 20 sustained severe injuries, a few fainted in fear following the life-threatening bomb assaults and repeated gunshots that lasted for more than one hour.\n\n\u201cI can tell you in confidence that close to about 100 vehicles including the Black Marias, the long buses and others usually used to convey inmates to court, individual cars and other salient property within the vicinity of the facility, were burnt during the assault.\n\n\u201cBesides, officials of the Directorate of State Security Service (DSS) had early Wednesday morning sealed up all ends in and out of Kuje, stopped every moving vehicle for careful search for any suspected escapee.\n\n\u201cThough we, here at the Headquarters, learnt a few were found out in the process but I am not in the position to tell you the precise numbers that were recaptured.\n\n\u201cSome fleeing inmates, perhaps fearing the apparent repercussion of being captured by eagle-eye SSS operatives opted to turn themselves in by returning to the facility from their hide-out,\u201d a senior staff of the correctional centre, who declined to be named because the official does not have the authority to speak on the matter, said.\n\nEyewitness experience\n\nNarrating his experience during the fracas, Mr. John, a senior staff of a federal agency said when the first bomb exploded, residents in the immediate neighbourhood scampered for safety, some running into nearby bushes across a stream, while others took to their heels towards the military checkpoint.\n\nHe also said many others decided to lie flat on the floor of their houses to avoid being hit by stray bullet.\n\nSchools shut\n\nMeanwhile, all the primary and secondary schools within Kuje metropolis and its immediate environs were shut as students, including those to write their Senior Secondary Certificate Examination conducted by the West African Examination Council (WAEC), were asked to return to the safety of their homes.\n\nAlso, those students in the boarding houses equally directed their wards to vacate their facilities and return to their parents until the authority found it convenient and safe for them to return.\n\nBoko Haram detainees escape\n\nReacting to the attack when he visited the scene, Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (retd), said all the 64 members of the Boko Haram terrorists fled the facility.\n\nMagashi told newsmen that there were strong indications that terrorists invaded the facility to free their members being held in detention.\n\nHe explained that the federal government was working hard to ensure that other fleeing inmates were recaptured and kept back in the facility.\n\n\u201cMost likely, they are Boko Haram because we have a sizeable number of Boko Haram (members) that are in detention.\n\n\u201cPresently, we could not locate any of them. I think there are about 64 Boko Haram (members) in prison, they have all escaped,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe said the correctional centre could accommodate 994 prison inmates.\n\nThe minister further said that before the end of the day, many more inmates still hiding would be rearrested and sent back to the facility.\n\nMagashi said: \u201cWe are trying to see what we can do to ensure that all the escapees are brought back to the prison yard. I think the prison is an accommodation for about 994 inmate escapees.\n\n\u201cWe have 600 already inside now and many people are being captured and brought back to the prison. Maybe by the close of the day, more would have been captured. I think everything is under control.\u201d\n\nNCS confirms devt\n\nConfirming the development through an official statement, NCS spokesman, Umar Abubakar, said 443 of the escapees had been recaptured, bringing the total number of inmates in the facility to 578.\n\nAbubakar said: \u201cThree of the attackers were killed in the encounter while several others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cRecall that in the wake of the attack on Abolongo Custodial Centre in Oyo State, the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola met with the Security Chiefs in the ministry to draw up a joint security framework for the protection of Custodial Centres against further breaches.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to expanding the frontiers of collaboration to other agencies to fortify the facilities. Hence, at the time of the attack, personnel from the military, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Police Force, State Security Service were on ground to support men of the Armed Squad unit of the Nigerian Correctional Service.\n\n\u201cDuring the gun battle, a personnel of the NSCDC unfortunately lost his life and three (3) officers of the Nigerian Correctional Service also sustained bullet injuries. Four (4) inmates lost their lives while 16 others sustained various degrees of injury.\n\n\u201cThe Controller-General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa has ordered immediate deployment of the e-Corrections Information Management System (e-CIMS) to track all fleeing inmates and return them to custody.\n\n\u201cWhile appealing for prompt supply of credible information to rearesst the fleeing inmates, the Controller General assures the public that the biometrics of all the inmates are intact and will be used to track them wherever they hide.\n\n\u201cHe expressed his appreciation to men of other security agencies for their support and gallantry even as he extends his condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and wishes the injured a quick recovery.\u201d\n\nBuhari raises posers\n\nIn a related development, President Muhammadu Buhari raised some posers over the Kuje jailbreak, asking a myriad of questions around the security breach at the facility.\n\nPresident Buhari raised the posers Wednesday during a 30-minute inspection visit to the facility.\n\nSoon after he arrived, he was briefed about the attack by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Dr. Shuaib Mohammad Lamido Belgore and the Controller General of Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa.\n\nThe president was shown the bombed-out section used to access the facility and the records office which was set on fire, following which the invaders launched an attack on all cells where the Boko Haram terrorists were held.\n\nThe president was also told that at the end of the melee, none of the 64 terrorists were accounted for, but it was emphasized that records were not lost because they have been backed up.\n\nPresident Buhari, who, like most Nigerians was shocked by both the scale and audacity of the attack queried: \u201cHow did the defence at the prison fail to prevent the attack? How many inmates were in the facility? How many of them can you account for? How many personnel did you have on duty? How many of them were armed? Were there guards on the watchtower? What did they do? Does the CCTV work?\u201d It was question after question.\n\nThe President was also informed that the security forces had recaptured 350 of the escapees while about 450 others were still unaccounted for, and that efforts were on to recapture the rest.\n\nAfter inspecting some of the points impacted by the attack, President Buhari spoke to newsmen, expressing disappointment with the intelligence system (and utilization).\n\n\u201cI am disappointed with the intelligence system. How can terrorists organize, have weapons, attack a security installation and get away with it?\u201d\n\nThe President, accompanied by Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, the Chief of Staff, said at the end of the visit that he is expecting \u201ca comprehensive report\u201d on the incident.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Senegal trip\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency Wednesday dismissed criticisms that greeted Buhari\u2019s Dakar trip.\n\nThe position was made known by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nResponding to a question on the desirability of the President visit to Senegal for the International Development Association (IDA) for Africa Summit, Adesina said: \u201cYes, the president should go because there\u2019s an international conference meant for heads of states and presidents, he should attend. You should never give in to terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe moment theories begin to stop you from doing things, then we might as well throw up our hands in surrender. The President should go ahead. Yes, it\u2019s an international obligation.\u201d\n\nExpert reacts\n\nCommenting on the jailbreak, a security expert and retired intelligence officer, Mohammed Bashir, said the attack on the Kuje Custodial facility goes beyond the ability of the Nigerian state to properly secure inmates, but calls to question, the entire security architecture of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cI understand the Guards Brigade takes charge of the security of the seat of power. Even whilst driving into Kuje, Kubwa, Gwagwalada and its environs, you see them setting up check points, so how are the attackers able to sneak in with their weapons undetected and leave unscratched? It calls to questions the entire security architecture of the Nigerian State as this is too close to the seat of power in Nigeria,\u201d Bashir noted.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has been asked to stop the All Progressives Congress (APC) from replacing Kabiru Masari as the running mate to the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.\n\nShortly after Tinubu emerged as the APC flagbearer, the party submitted Masari\u2019s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the vice-presidential candidate, for the meantime.\n\nHowever, two chieftains of the party and delegates in the just concluded APC national convention, Zakari Maigari and Zubainatu Mohammed approached the court to stop INEC from accepting a change of vice-presidential candidate from APC.\n\nThe plaintiffs joined, APC, INEC, Tinubu, and Masari as defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1059/2022 and dated July 4, 2022.\n\nThey asked the court to determine whether it was legally permissible for Masari to withdraw as the vice-presidential candidate of the APC so as to be substituted or replaced with another person by the party, with regards to the combined effect of sections 142(1) and sections 29(1), 31 and 33 of the Electoral Act.\n\nRelying on the joint ticket provision in section 142(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, the plaintiffs prayed the court to determine whether the withdrawal of Masari as the vice-presidential candidate does not entail the automatic withdrawal of Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate for purpose of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThey, therefore, sought the following reliefs:\n\nWhether having regard to the combined effect of sections 142(1) and sections 29(1), 31, and 33 of the Electoral Act, it is legally permissible for the 4 Defendant, Masari, to withdraw as the vice-presidential candidate of the 1st Defendant, APC, and the running mate of the 3 Defendant, Bola Tinubu, so as to be substituted or replaced with another person by the 1st Defendant, APC as its candidate for the office of Vice President for purpose of the February 25, 2023, Presidential Election.\n\nWhether in view of the joint ticket provision in section 142(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, the withdrawal of the 4h Defendant, MASARI, as the candidate for the office of Vice President does not entail the automatic withdrawal of the 3\u2033 Defendant, Tinubu, as the candidate for the office of President for purpose of the 2023 General Elections.\n\nWhether having regard to the provisions of sections 29(1), 31 and 33 of the Electoral Act 2022, the 1\u2033 Defendant , APC, is entitled to submit the name of any other person to replace the name of the 4 Defendant , MASARI, as the candidate for the office of Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, without holding a fresh primary election to produce a fresh presidential candidate.\n\nWhether the 3 Defendant, Tinubu, having nominated the 4 Defendant, Masari, in compliance with section 142(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, the 3 Defendant, Tinubu, can subsequently validly undertake or effect nomination of any other person to replace the Masari, whether upon withdrawal of the 4 Defendant, Masari or under any other circumstances, in view of the provisions of section 33 of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe plaintiffs pointed out that Section 187 (1) of the Constitution creates the governorship candidate and deputy-governorship candidate joint ticket, just as section 142(1) establishes the joint-ticket for the presidential candidate and vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, it is submitted that the same principles apply in both situations,\u201d they said. \u201cIn the case of the governorship candidate and deputy governorship candidate joint ticket, it was held in PDP v.

Both candidates disqualified are deemed not to be candidates at the governorship election conducted in Bayelsa State, \u201d\n\nIt is believed that if this suit truly represents the law, then not only the APC will be affected.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

          "title": "An Intruder Can Access Kuje Prison Easily \u2013 Retired Grp. Captain",
          "text": "A retired military officer and security expert, Group Captain Sadeeq Shehu, on Wednesday said it is easy for intruders to breach security at the correctional centre in Abuja.\n\nFollowing his visit to the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Kuje hours after it came under attack by terrorists, Shehu stated that his findings showed a poor security architecture of the facility.\n\n\u201cI took time to go to Kuje prison for the first time today and I was noting the terrain and the access to the prison,\u201d he highlighted during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today. \u201cAs soon as you come to Kuje \u2013 the main prison itself, what strikes you is a neglected derelict building.\n\n\u201cThe main gate which you will enter is so crowded with trees and overgrown shrubs that you cannot see 10 metres ahead of you. My estimation is that if somebody with a bad plan wants to move on Kuje prison, nobody will know he is approaching until he is at the facility.\u201d\n\nWhile most people could have thought the day was over last night, it appeared to be the appropriate time for Boko Haram terrorists who invaded the correctional facility.\n\nApart from freeing hundreds of inmates said to be awaiting trial, according to authorities, the assailants left with all terrorists numbering 64 held at the centre for their roles in the insurgency in the North East.\n\nHours after the incident, President Muhammadu Buhari visited the scene where he expressed his disappointment with the intelligence at the facility.\n\nAmid widespread criticism sparked by the incident, Shehu who is an adjunct professor at the European Institute of Security Studies believes the security at the facility is below standard.\n\n\u201cI am happy to hear that the President said that he was disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the President had come the way I came; even the outer walls of the Kuje prison are too low for a prison perimeter wall. The barbed wire is against regulation; there are standards for how a security wall that is housing a prison should be.\n\n\u201cYou should be talking about a wall that is 8 \u2013 16 feet (outer) but by my estimation, what I saw was about 7ft maximum. You are supposed to put three layers of barbed wire on top (of the fence) and the idea is to at least delay an attacker.\u201d\n\nThe security expert asserted, \u201cAn intruder can get into that prison easily. First, the place is clustered and overgrown with grasses which will even give any attacker a cover, especially in the night to move inwards until where the inmates are kept. The requirement is that there should be two fences in a normal prison.\n\n\u201cThe outer may be opaque, but the inner wall should be like a fence. Between these two (fences), you are supposed to have a clear area so that when someone breaches the outer wall, there is time to engage him before he gets to the main building; that killing zone does not exist there.\u201d\n\nHe also complained that there were lots of vehicles parked by the fence, stressing that they could also provide cover to intruders.\n\nOn the way forward, Shehu appealed to the relevant authorities to ensure modern security measures were put in place at the Kuje custodial centre and other correctional facilities across the country.",
          "summary": "Following his visit to the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Kuje hours after it came under attack by terrorists, Shehu stated that his findings showed a poor security architecture of the facility.\n\u201cI took time to go to Kuje prison for the first time today and I was noting the terrain and the access to the prison,\u201d he highlighted during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\u201cAs soon as you come to Kuje \u2013 the main prison itself, what strikes you is a neglected derelict building.\n\u201cIf the President had come the way I came; even the outer walls of the Kuje prison are too low for a prison perimeter wall.\nThe barbed wire is against regulation; there are standards for how a security wall that is housing a prison should be.",

They came in their numbers gained entrance into the prison and they released some of the inmates and which we are now following to see the kind of inmates that they have released.\n\n\u201cVery soon, we will give you the correct figure of the inmates that were taken. Aside that, we are trying to see what we can do to ensure that all escapees are returned back.\n\n\u201cThe prison is accommodating about 994 inmates and over 600 escaped. Many people have been recaptured and brought back to the prison. Maybe by the close of the day, more will have been captured and returned.\n\n\u201cI think everything is under control. The people who came to do this activity, from the records, we believe they belong to a particular group. Most likely, they are Boko Haram members because we have sizeable number of Boko Haram suspects in detention, and presently we cannot locate any of them.\n\n\u201cI think they are about 64 in the prison and none of them now is available they have all escaped.\u201d",
