          "text": "The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, has said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), desires to see peace and unity reign in all parts of the country.\n\nAdesina said this when he received some Nollywood actors, members of the National Council for Women Society, and representatives of National Associations of Nigerian Students, as well as other stakeholders under the auspices of Ambassadors of Voice for Change in his office at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cMr. President is actuated by nothing else than peace and unity of the country, many times he has said that those of them that fought for the unity of Nigeria will not sit down with their eyes open and see the country dismembered in their presence.\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. President wants is peace, unity and whatever it takes for Nigeria to have peace, she will have it. I remembered I did a piece recently where I said for Nigeria, it is \u2018Peace Dole\u2019 (Peace by Force).\n\n\u201cThe idea of this movement, Ambassadors of Voice for Change, is very good.

Our collective interest is that our unity in diversity is maintained so that we remain together in peace and unity, and there is strength in unity.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson of Ambassadors of Voice of Change, Zack Orji said the group is ready to collaborate with the security agencies and Nigerians to ensure that there is peace and unity in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no way government is going to work alone without the cooperation of the people. This movement will cover the 36 States of the Federation; our aim is to engage roadshows, town hall meetings, rallies and all kinds of meetings to sensitise people so they can be on the same bandwagons as ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Ambassadors of Voice for Change is an organisation made up of actors, musicians, comedians, producers, directors, and filmmakers.\n\nThe representatives who were at the State House included Zack Orji, Ahmed Bala, John Okafor (Mr Ibu), Sani Denja, Saheed Balogun, Ben Kure, Gentle Jack, Benedict Johnson, Andy Chukwu and Chiege Alisigwe.",

          "title": "Story of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) (2)",
          "text": "Later on, Nawfal entered into alliance with Bani \u2018Abd Shams bin \u2018Abd Munaf against Bani Hashim. When Khuza\u2018a, a tribe, saw Bani An-Najjar\u2019s support to \u2018Abdul-Muttalib they said: \u201cHe is our son as he is yours. We have more reasons to support him than you.\u201d\n\n\u2018Abd Munaf\u2019s mother was one of them. They went into An-Nadwa House and entered into alliance with Bani Hashim against Bani \u2018Abd Shams and Nawfal. It was an alliance that was later to constitute the main reason for the conquest of Makkah.\n\n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib witnessed two important events in his lifetime, namely digging Zamzam well and the Elephant raid.\n\nIn brief, \u2018Abdul-Muttalib received an order in his dream to dig Zamzam well in a particular place. He did that and found the things that Jurhum men had buried therein when they were forced to evacuate Makkah.\n\nHe found the swords, armours and the two deer of gold. The gate of Al-Ka\u2018bah was stamped from the gold swords and the two deer and then the tradition of providing Zamzam water to pilgrims was established.\n\nWhen the well of Zamzam gushed water forth, Quraish made a claim to partnership in the enterprise, but \u2018Abdul-Muttalib refused their demands on grounds that All\u00e2h had singled only him out for this honourable job.\n\nTo settle the dispute, they agreed to consult Bani Sa\u2018d\u2019s diviner. On their way, All\u00e2h showed them His Signs that confirmed \u2018Abdul-Muttalib\u2019s prerogative as regards the sacred spring. Only then did \u2018Abdul-Muttalib make a solemn vow to sacrifice one of his adult children to Al-Ka\u2018bah if he had ten.\n\nThe second event was that of Abraha As-Sabah Al-Habashi, the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) viceroy in Yemen. He had seen that the Arabs made their pilgrimage to Al-Ka\u2018bah so he built a large church in San\u2018a in order to attract the Arab pilgrims to it to the exclusion of Makkah.\n\nA man from Kinana tribe understood this move, therefore he entered the church stealthily at night and besmeared its front wall with excrement.\n\nWhen Abraha knew of that, he got very angry and led a great army \u2013 of sixty thousand warriors \u2013 to demolish Al-Ka\u2018bah. He chose the biggest elephant for himself. His army included nine or thirteen elephants. He continued marching until he reached a place called Al-Magmas. There, he mobilized his army, prepared his elephants and got ready to enter Makkah. When he reached Muhassar Valley, between Muzdalifah and Mina, the elephant knelt down and refused to go forward.\n\nWhenever they directed it northwards, southwards or eastwards, the elephant moved quickly but whe directed westwards towards Al-Ka\u2018bah, it knelt down.\n\nMeanwhile, All\u00e2h loosed upon them birds in flights, hurling against them stones of baked clay and made them like green blade devoured. These birds were very much like swallows and sparrows, each carrying three stones; one in its peak and two in its claws.\n\nThe stones hit Abraha\u2019s men and cut their limbs and killed them. A large number of Abraha\u2019s soldiers were killed in this way and the others fled at random and died everywhere. Abraha himself had an infection that had his fingertips amputated. When he reached San\u2018a he was in a miserable state and died soon after.\n\nThe Quraishites on their part had fled for their lives to the hillocks and mountain tops. When the enemy had been thus routed, they returned home safely.\n\nThe Event of the Elephant took place in the month of Al-Muharram, fifty or fifty five days before the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) which corresponded to late February or early March 571 A.D.\n\nIt was a gift from All\u00e2h to His Prophet and his family. It could actually be regarded as a Divine auspicious precursor of the light to come and accompany the advent of the Prophet and his family.\n\nBy contrast, Jerusalem had suffered under the yoke of the atrocities of All\u00e2h\u2019s enemies. Here we can recall Bukhtanassar in B.C. 587 and the Romans in 70 A.D. Al-Ka\u2018bah, by Divine Grace, never came under the hold of the Christians \u2013 the Muslims of that time \u2013 although Makkah was populated by polytheists.\n\nNews of the Elephant Event reached the most distant corners of the then civilized world.\n\nAbyssinia (Ethiopia) maintained strong ties with the Romans, while the Persians on the other hand, were on the vigil with respect to any strategic changes that were looming on the socio-political horizon, and soon came to occupy Yemen.\n\nIncidentally, the Roman and Persian Empires stood for the powerful civilized world at that time. The Elephant Raid Event riveted the world\u2019s attention to the sacredness of All\u00e2h\u2019s House, and showed that this House had been chosen by All\u00e2h for its ho.\n\nIt followed then if any of its people claimed Prophethood, it would be congruous with the outcome of the Elephant Event, and would provide a justifiable explanation for the ulterior Divine Wisdom that lay behind backing polytheists against Christians in a manner that transcended the cause-and-effect formula.\n\n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons, Al-Harith, Az-Zubair, Abu Talib, \u2018Abdullah, Hamzah, Abu Lahab, Ghidaq, Maqwam, Safar and Al-\u2018Abbas. He also had six daughters, who were Umm Al-Hakim \u2013 the only white one, Barrah, \u2018Atikah, Safiya, Arwa and Omaima.\n\n4. \u2018Abdullah: The father of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). His mother was Fatimah, daughter of \u2018Amr bin \u2018A\u2019idh bin \u2018Imran bin Makhzum bin Yaqdha bin Murra. \u2018Abdullah was the smartest of \u2018Abdul-Muttalib\u2019s sons, the chastest and the most loved.\n\nHe was also the son whom the divination arrows pointed at to be slaughtered as a sacrifice to Al-Ka\u2018bah. When \u2018Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons and they reached maturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they silently and obediently acquiesced.\n\nTheir names were written on divination arrows and given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The arrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was \u2018Abdullah to be sacrificed. \u2018Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka\u2018bah with a razor to slaughter the boy.\n\nQuraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and his brother Abu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from consummating his purpose. He then sought their advice as regards his vow. They suggested that he summon a she-diviner to judge whereabout.\n\nShe ordered that the divination arrows should be drawn with respect to \u2018Abdullah as well as ten camels. She added that drawing the lots should be repeated with ten more camels every time the arrow showed \u2018Abdullah.\n\nThe operation was thus repeated until the number of the camels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow showed the camels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the satisfaction of Hubal) instead of his son. The slaughtered camels were left for anyone to eat from, human or animal.\n\nThis incident produced a change in the amount of blood-money usually accepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was increased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this. Another thing closely relevant to the above issue goes to the effect that the Prophet (Peace be upon him) once said: \u201cI am the offspring of the slaughtered two,\u201d meaning Ishmael and \u2018Abdullah.\n\n\u2018Abdul-Muttalib chose Amina, daughter of Wahab bin \u2018Abd Munaf bin Zahra bin Kilab, as a wife for his son, \u2018Abdullah. She thus, in the light of this ancestral lineage, stood eminent in respect of nobility of position and descent.\n\nHer father was the chief of Bani Zahra to whom great honour was attributed. They were married in Makkah, and soon after \u2018Abdullah was sent by his father to buy dates in Madinah where he died.\n\nIn another version, \u2018Abdullah went to Syria on a trade journey and died in Madinah on his way back. He was buried in the house of An-Nabigha Al-Ju\u2018di. He was twenty-five years old when he died.\n\nMost historians state that his death was two months before the birth of Muhammad. Some others said that his death was two months after the Prophet\u2019s birth.

          "title": "Secondus moves to stop PDP national convention with fresh suit",
          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor and Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja\n\nSuspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has moved against the party\u2019s national convention slated for October 30 and 31, 2021. According to Secondus, the PDP cannot go ahead with its plans to hold the convention with his appeal against his suspension yet to be determined.\n\nConsequently, Secondus, through his lawyer, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo, has written to the leadership of the PDP to warn that it would be illegal for the party to hold the convention pending the hearing of an appeal he filed against his suspension. Recall that a High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, had on September 10, 2021 delivered a judgement restraining Secondus from performing the functions of the office of National Chairman of the PDP.\n\nSecondus had filed an appeal at the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal seeking to upturn the judgement of the lower court. The letter from Secondus\u2019 lawyers to the PDP reads: \u201cWe act for the appellant in the above captioned matter, Prince Uche Secondus, who was the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), prior to the institution of Suit Number PHC/2183/CS/2021, and wish to bring to your attention the following facts:\n\n\u201cOn 23 August 2021 one Mr Ibeawuchi E. Alex and four others jointly instituted Suit No PHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division against Prince Uche Secondus and the PDP as Defendants.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cOn 10 September 2021, the High Court of Rivers State delivered its judgment in the Suit whereby Prince Uche Secondus was, inter alia, restrained from performing the functions of the office of National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAn appeal has been filed and entered against the judgment at the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Judicial Division. In addition, an Application on Notice has been filed in which Prince Uche Secondus is seeking, inter alia, the following orders:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAn Order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6th Respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30 and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\n\n\u201cThe application has since been served on you and other Respondents in the appeal. Notwithstanding the service of the Application for injunction, it has come to the Notice of our client that the PDP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the National Convention on 30 and 31 October 2021\n\nRead Also: Only five women among 33 PDP NWC contestants\n\n\u201cThis letter is intended to draw your attention to the position of the law of Nigeria on this subject as encapsulated in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the celebrated case of GOVERNOR OF LAGOS STATE vs. CHIEF EMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU (1986) I NWLR (Part 18) 621 @ 637, in which the court, reviewed various decisions on the point, and approved the following principles as the correct position of the law, that is:\n\n\u201cThe rule is well settled \u2026\u2026 that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities \u2026\u2026of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and determination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued\u2026..\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merits as they may be ultimately decided.\u201d\n\n\u201c The same position was taken by the Court of Appeal in CHIEF ELIAS OKEKE-OBA vs. IKWUKA OKOYE (1994) 8 NWLR (364) 605 @ 617-618, where the court said as follows:\n\n\u201cThe general practice is that on application for an order for interlocutory injunction, all activities affecting the res, \u2026.are automatically terminated as a mark of respect to the court before whom the application is pending.\u2026..if..parties to the suit senselessly rush their tortious trespassory activities\u2026in the spacious belief that that would promote their unfounded claims to the res. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Such heedless posture is, to say the least, a fragrant disrespect to the court. It clearly, in my opinion amounts to intransigence for a party against whom an order for injunction is sought to intensify his interference with the res.. The court cannot be hoodwinked by such impropriety of unlawful acts in relation to the res.\u2026\u2026Nor can the person in such disrespect be allowed to take advantage of his default and flagrant intransigence.\u201d\n\n\u201c The logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts is that having been served with an application seeking to restrain the holding of its National Convention pending the determination of the appeal filed by Prince Uche Seconds, the PDP would be embarking upon a collision course with the court if it proceeds to hold the National\n\nConvention before the hearing and determination of the Application.\n\n\u201cShould such contumacious conduct of holding the National Convention before the hearing and determination of the Application be embarked upon by the Party however, we shall not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law against all national officers of the Party that are responsible for such conduct of contempt of court.\n\n\u201c Quite apart from the fact that such contumacious conduct would impinge on the integrity of the Party, we would on our part, swiftly take steps to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to nullify any decision, action or step taken at such Convention.\n\nJoined in the suit are the PDP Acting National Chairman, the Chairman, PDP National Convention Committee, the PDP National Organising Secretary, the PDP National Legal Adviser and the PDP National Secretary.\n\nFollowing the suspension of Secondus, the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the party, Elder Yomi Akinwonmi, in line with the PDP constitution, has been acting in his stead. Akinwonmi presided over the National Executive Committee (NEC) meetings, where crucial decision, including the setting up of the convention committee, were taken. The Nation gathered that the embattled chairman may also ask the court to declare all decisions taken by the Akinwonmi-led NWC as illegal.\n\nThe media team of the PDP chairman had earlier revealed that he is under pressure to move agitation the party and stop the convention. According to Ike Abonyi, Special Adviser to Secondus, \u201cPrince Secondus is really under pressure for justice and would seek it anywhere to save the party from hirelings out to destroy and derail the focus of the party. The party leaders are aware of who went to court against it and knows what to do rather than indulging in the mind game. Nothing short of Justice and respect for its servants will save PDP from the hands holding now.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt the justice Prince Secondus is seeking is as enshrined in the party constitution which is Supreme and states clearly how a National Chairman and any National officer can be sanctioned even where there is a known beach talk less where this none.\u201d\n\nThe Nation also gathered that Secondus has received the support of some prominent leaders and chieftains of the troubled party to pursue his case against the party and stall the convention. Checks by The Nation revealed that some party leaders currently aggrieved with the ongoing zoning and micro-zoning arrangements within the PDP may have resorted to backing Secondus in his bid to ensure that the convention does not hold as planned.\n\n\u201cThe zoning controversy is also not helping matters. Those who are afraid that they are losing out are now supporting Secondus. They see him as one way of stopping the convention. Among them are very influential party leaders across the country and some national assembly members. Secondus on his own feels it is unfair for the party to keep him in the dark and be planning to elect a replacement for him. He is very optimistic that he has a good case,\u201d a source told The Nation on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has confirmed the interest of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State, in the 2023 PDP presidential ticket. Speaking during a current affairs programme on Channels Television, monitored by our correspondent, Makinde said the three northern PDP chieftains have indicated interest to contest presidency in the next general elections. He described them all as \u201ceminently qualified personalities in PDP that can lead the country successfully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that the situation in this country today, the only way that you can stop PDP at the federal level is by dividing PDP internally. All the governors of the PDP are well aware of this fact and we made unity within ourselves our number one priority. Once the governors of PDP are able to move in one direction, align on most of the issues and the challenges we are faced with, I think there is hope for this country. The issue right now is that PDP has eminently qualified personalities that can lead this country successfully.\n\n\u201cSome have indicated interest, like former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, like Governor Tambuwal, like Governor Bala Mohammed. They have indicated interest. But the bottom line is when we get to that bridge, we will definitely cross it. What is important at this stage, which I will solicit the support of PDP members and the generality of Nigerians, is please support us to have a successful national convention. There is no way you can become anything, president, vice-president, even governor, if we don\u2019t have a party. What we want to do first is ensure that we get things right within our party,\u201d he said.",

Sunday Igboho is a member of the National Assembly.\n\nMalami, who was silent on the identity of the federal lawmaker, said a report by a committee constituted by the Federal Government also revealed that Igboho allegedly received funding from a firm, Abbai Bako and Sons, allegedly being probed for terrorism financing activities.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter, Abdullahi Umar Usman, are suspects in the ongoing Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAbdullahi Umar Usman is, by way of financial transaction, connected to Surajo Abubakar Muhammad (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram),\u201d Malami said.\n\nBut reacting to the AGF\u2019s claims yesterday, the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, described them as \u201cillogical reasoning\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSenate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, also described the allegations against Igboho as weighty but lacking facts.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, Malami said the Presidential Ad-hoc Committee set up after the re-arrest of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, had been able to identify Igboho\u2019s sponsors and financiers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Federal Government has received the report on financiers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThe report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited, registered on 23rd April, 2010.\n\n\u201cAdesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Law Maker in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N127,145,000.00 was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200.00 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11th March, 2021.\n\nInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12,750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\n\u201cThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept\n\nLtd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\u201d\n\nThe AGF also said the committee catalogued the alleged atrocities committed by Kanu and his associates in the course of their terrorism activities.\n\nMalami claimed that Kanu took advantage of the 2020 EndSARS protest to destroy property and killed individuals, particularly security personnel.\n\n\u201cDespite the proscription of IPOB by the Federal Government, Nnamdi Kanu continued the subversive campaign, instigating and inciting broadcasts to direct members of the IPOB to launch attacks on government.\n\n\u201cThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down police stations, correctional centres, INEC offices, bus terminals, the palace of Oba of Lagos, banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\n\n\u201cOn 12th December, 2020, Eastern Security Network (ESN) was formed by Nnamdi Kanu as an armed wing of IPOB with the mandate to advance the nefarious agenda of the outlawed group.\n\n\u201cESN continued to launch attacks on security personnel, civilians perceived as enemies as well as destruction of private and public properties.\n\n\u201cThe destructive activities of IPOB/ESN pose serious threat to Nigeria\u2019s National Security and its corporate existence, which resulted into re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and members of his group,\u201d Malami said.\n\nThe AGF added that there was information that Kanu was receiving supports from both within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have also established that KANU is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSome of the state actors aided KANU, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\n\u201cWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by KANU and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people,\u201d Malami said.\n\nThe AGF gave details of persons allegedly killed and property destroyed by Kanu\u2019s associates who acted on his inciting comments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe committee finds as a fact, that consequent upon the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, members of IPOB/ESN carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions especially INEC Facilities with a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 include the following:\n\n\u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cOn 21st October 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out and several security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201c175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 Police men, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives.\n\n\u201cKilling of prominent Nigerians (recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on 30th May. 2021);\n\n\u201cAs a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were nineteen (19) attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\n\u201c164 police stations and formations, including Police headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of 128 policemen, 144 injured, while 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\n\u201cThree hundred and ninety-six (396) firearms and seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty eight (17,738) ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks;\n\n\u201cThere were three (3) IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), including the headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where one thousand eight hundred and forty one (1,841) inmates escaped.\n\n\u201cThe headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one (1) officer,\u201d Malami said.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lawyer faults Malami, says politicians pressuring Yoruba nation agitator for endorsement\n\nThe lead counsel to the embattled Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), however, faulted Malami\u2019s claims that a link had been established between his client and an alleged financier of terrorists.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Alliyu explained that the minister only tried in futility to establish the link in order to nail his client who has been held in Cotonou, Benin Republic without charges since July 18.\n\nIgboho\u2019s detention is believed to have been carried out on the orders of the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable it prepare the ground for his arrest and prosecution for agitating for Yoruba nation.\n\nAlliyu\u2019s statement reads: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a text press conference by the Hon. Attorney General and Minister of Justice wherein he fruitlessly tried to paint our client and those patronising his car trade as terrorists and/or financiers of terrorists.\n\n\u201cI have gone through the text. Sunday was alleged to have transferred the sum of N12.7m to Abbal Bako & Sons owned by Abdullahi Umar. Transferring money to bureau de change to buy dollars is what is done by every businessman of our client\u2019s calibre. Thank God that his passports and various bills of ladings were carted away by DSS during the ungodly invasion of 1st July, 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, so far, there is no evidence of receipt of money from Abbal Bako & Sons or Abdullahi Umar, going by the text conference. What the Hon AGF stated are mere conjectures, not hard fact.\n\n\u201cOur client, according to him, paid Umar and NOT vice versa, thus believing what the Honourable Attorney General of Federation earlier said that Chief Sunday Adeyemo is being financed by people.\n\n\u201cThe picture the Learned AGF wanted to paint is that our Client is being financed by Abdullah Umar allegedly involved in terrorists financing. Who is now financing who?\n\n\u201cAgain, Chief Adeyemo is a car dealer trading in the name of Adesun International Concept Ltd. Does it mean that anybody buying car from him or selling car to him is a terrorist?\n\n\u201cChief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Igboho Oosa was not into Oodua Nation until last year. So, finding over N273m turnover between October 2013 and September 2020 shows that he was not a poor man. His house invaded by DSS on 1st July 2020 is worth over N2 billion!\n\n\u201cI challenge the Hon AGF to mention the lawmaker that sent money to Chief Sunday Adeyemo for terrorist act whether he would not be damnified in exemplary damages for defamation.\n\n\u201cUp till date, our client has not been prosecuted or found liable for any criminal act or terrorism. There is also a valid and subsisting court judgment that agitation for self-determination is not an act of terrorism but fundamental human right of any citizen.\n\n\u201cMy Learned brother Silk and Hon AGF knows that suspicion, no matter how great, cannot grant conviction. Chief Sunday Adeyemo is not a terrorist but a campaigner for self-determination.\u201d\n\nAttorney-General\u2019s claims illogical \u2014 Afenifere\n\nApex Yoruba Organization, Afenifere has reacted to a statement by Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami that Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho has ties to Terrorism.\n\nAfenifere, in a press release signed by its Secretary-General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, yesterday described Malami\u2019s statements as \u201cIllogical reasoning\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Federal Government with its Attorney General will not stop amusing themselves with illogical reasoning on the nationality question.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the AG would be guided by the standard of a reasonable man, which is a central test in legal inquiry, before addressing the public.\n\n\u201cThis time around, the team set up by him, at a time he is hell-bent on nailing Igboho, has satisfied his emotional expectations, but in a most unreasonable and tenuous manner, by suggesting that Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba nation campaigner, would be on the same sponsorship with Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cOnly someone with pathological hatred for Igboho and insult to the Yoruba nation will find a common bed for Yoruba nation agitation and Boko Haram which is known to act in tandem with the Fulani herdsmen whose terrorist acts were responsible for Igboho\u2019s campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe whole world knows what Igboho stood and still stands for and his peaceful modus operandi, in spite of the unwarranted invasion of his house which was aimed at his life by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cIt is of amusing cruelty that the Federal Government, which was unable to defend itself of terrorism against Igboho and for which it was handed N20 billion in aggravated damages, would turn around that Igboho received less than N200 million to sponsor terrorism since 2013 when Igboho had never been heard of and when Major General Muhammad Buhari, as former Military Head of State then, was campaigning for the Sharia as a law of general application in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and its security agencies should better pay the damages awarded against them, apologise to Igboho and his household for the acts of terrorism committed against the peaceful campaigner.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government may continue to play the ostrich, the whole world knows those who enacted, engineered and continue to promote terrorism in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWeighty allegation without facts, says Senate spokesman\n\nContacted for his reaction to Malami\u2019s allegations against Igboho yesterday, the Chairman Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, said there were no facts to respond to, since the Attorney-General did not mention any National Assembly member\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cDid he mention the person\u2019s name?\u201d Basiru asked, adding that \u201csince he has not mentioned any name, I think we should wait for him to mention the name.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly members from the Southwest are many. We have 18 in the Senate and over 80 in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThe allegation is weighty, but we don\u2019t have facts to respond to.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the Southwest caucus in the House of Representatives, Rep. Olufemi Fakeye, declined comments when he was contacted yesterday.\n\n\u201cI have no reaction to it. I have not heard about it. I am just hearing it from you now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spokesman of the House, Rep. Benjamin Kalu, also did not respond to a message sent to his Whatsapp line and also did not pick the calls made to his phone.\n\nDSS frees two remaining Igboho allies\n\nTwo allies of Igboho in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) were released yesterday, according to their lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi.\n\nThe duo, Amudat Babatunde Abibat a.k.a. Lady K and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, were among 12 persons who were arrested when DSS operatives stormed Adeyemo\u2019s house in Oyo State on July 1, 2021.\n\nAdeyemo\u2019s house had been raided on allegations of arms stockpiling, according to the Service.\n\nOlajengbesi, in a terse statement on yesterday, said while the matter was still a subject of litigation, they would have no further comment on it for now.\n\nOf the 12 associates of Adeyemo arrested on July 1, eight had been released on August 30 after a court order while two others were freed on September 3.\n\nThe spokesman of DSS, Dr Peter Afunanya, was yet to make any comment on the matter at press time yesterday.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja and oluseye ojo, ibadan\n\nThe Federal Government has made some damning allegations against leader of Yoruba Nation agitation, Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) and the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB(, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nWhile the government said some countries are aiding Kanu in his subversive activities to destabilize the country, it accused Igboho of being sponsored by a lawmaker and having links with a group accused of financing Boko Haram.\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, who made the allegation on Friday disclosed that some state actors aided Kanu after he escaped from the country.\n\nMalami also accused an unnamed sitting federal lawmaker and others of being the major financiers of the Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho).\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing held in his office, Malami said, \u201cWe have also established that Kanu is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSome of the state actors aided Kanu, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\n\u201cWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by Kanu and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people. Conversely, there are some friendly countries which, recognising the status of IPOB as a terrorist organization, have either banned the activities of IPOB or placed Kanu on Stop List.\n\n\u201cTo these peace loving countries that have put Kanu on their Stop Lists and banned IPOB from operating in their territories, we express our appreciation\u201d, Malami stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential adhoc Committee Investigating the activities of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has indicted Kanu of instigating violence leading to killings and destructive activities in the South East. AGF disclosed that President Buhari had, after Kanu was re-arrested in June, inaugurated a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee to investigate activities of the IPOB. He said that 24 members of the committee were drawn from the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Federal Ministry of Information (MoI), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).\n\nAccording to him, the outcome of an investigation that was conducted by the committee, revealed that the IPOB and the Eastern Security Network, ESN, have so far, killed 175 security personnel comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives. He said the investigation further revealed that Kanu\u2019s broadcasts fuelled the #EndSARS protests that led to the destruction of public facilities, including the attack on the Oba of Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhile in self-exile, Nnamdi Kanu intensified his subversive campaign, using online Radio Biafra to instigate violence and incite members of IPOB to commit violent attacks against civil and democratic institutions, particularly the security personnel, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and civilians.\n\n\u201cHe instigated the destruction of public and private properties across the country. As a result of these criminal activities, IPOB was proscribed and designated a terrorist organization by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in an Order made on 20th September 2017. The AGF also the Federal Government has received the report on the financers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho). The report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in nine banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatist was found to be a Federal lawmaker in the National Assembly. A total sum of NI27, 145,000.00 was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200.00 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11th March, 2021. Investigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12, 750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\n\u201cIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation. Abdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram).\n\n\u201cThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country. The report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\n\nHaving received the reports, the Federal Government remains solute in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria. The Federal Government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is giving the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMeanwhile lawyer to Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has faulted the claims by the Federal Government, insisting that the Yoruba Nation agitator is a businessman, not a terrorist.\n\nThe lead counsel to Igboho, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), in his reaction, said apart from being a businessman selling cars, Igboho is also a campaigner for self-determination.\n\nAlliyu, in a press statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Friday, said: \u201cSunday was alleged to have transferred the sum of N12.7million to Abbal Bako & Sons, owned by Abdullahi Umar. Transferring money to bureau de change to buy dollars is what is done by every businessman of our client\u2019s calibre.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani And Job Osazuwa\n\nSaturday, October 16, was a special day in the annals of media events in Nigeria. It was a day The Sun Publishing Limited held its 18th edition of the annual The Sun Awards. The ceremony, which has unarguably become the biggest media event in Africa, honoured 24 outstanding Nigerians, for remarkably distinguishing themselves in their various fields of endeavours.\n\nThe event has come and gone, but its echoes still resonate, as millions of Nigerians within and outside the country that followed the live broadcast of the event on three national television stations keep talking about it. On that special day, the Expo Hall of Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, venue of the prestigious award, was filled to the brim, with guests from all walks of life.\n\nIt was the gathering of the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the Nigerian society, with state governors, state and federal legislators, politicians across party lines, captains of industry, business moguls, entertainment gurus and academics, among others all in attendance. The paraphernalia of some state governments were literally moved to the award venue, underscoring the importance of Africa\u2019s biggest media event. The Edo and Ondo State Government Houses were virtually relocated to the Eko Hotel venue of the event as the two state governors, their deputies, their chiefs of staff, their commissioners, and their state legislators, local government chairmen and other top government functionaries from both states were physically present at the event. Guests, elegantly and magnificently attired, were carefully ushered into the elaborate hall. Radiating beauty, panache, fun and elegance, they were skilfully arranged around tens of big round tables exquisitely draped with alluring white and red wraps of clothes, and bouquets of flowers, each table tempting and inviting. On the tables were also various kinds of drinks ranging from assorted wines and alcoholic beverages, juice, malt, mineral water and cans of table water as well as wine glasses.\n\nThe illumination that intermittently filled the stage marvelled all. The shining objects shone with gleam and constantly changed from bright to dim lights. A look up to the roof dazzled one with magnificent lights in diverse sizes and shapes that twinkled like a galaxy of stars; it was indeed a beauty to behold. The stage was just on fire, radiating everything about the beauty of The Sun as the Voice of the Nation.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe array of automobiles ranging from the latest sports cars to SUVs that flooded the car garage was a pointer to the fact that an unusual event was taking place at the ever busy hotel. The managers of the facility certainly had a hectic day attending to the guests who had started trickling in as early as 3pm.\n\nIt was indeed a night of glitz, glamour and honour. Though it was a night event, The Sun shone irresistibly while the occasion lasted.\n\nThe Sun Awards has been held consistently for the past 18 years, except last year when it was virtually hosted due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which disrupted the activities of mankind in all ramifications. But, even with the pandemic which literally halted almost all economic, political, religious and social events, not only in Nigeria but also all over the globe, The Sun Awards remained unstoppable. A virtual brand, which was the first of its kind in Nigeria, still held to the amazement of doubting Thomases. The almighty COVID-19 and its attendant ill winds were demystified. The Sun defied the deadly scourge and shone brightly.\n\nThe lovely evening started with a red carpet event, which commenced about 6pm, as eminent personalities and celebrities continued to troop to the Expo Hall of Eko Hotels for nthe night of glitz and glamour.\n\nA gale of commendations\n\nThose who have been keenly following the annual event all agreed that the choice of the magnificent hall suggests the size and stature of the event, which they also acknowledged has continued to be improved upon with every passing edition. They also agreed that with every edition, The Sun sets novel and higher standards for other media houses to emulate.\n\nFounder of a non-governmental organisation, David Folaranmi Foundation, Mr. David Folaranmi, described the massive turnout at the event as a pointer to the fact that the hundreds of thousands of Nigerians have come to the realization that it is indeed the biggest media event, not only in Nigeria but also in Africa.\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the awardees,\u201d he intoned. \u201cA careful look at their profiles and antecedents reveals that they deserved the honour bestowed on them.\u201d\n\nAlso rating the award, another guest, Abubakar Danladi, who was in the entourage of the governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje; confessed that the decoration, particularly the aesthetic touch on the pathway to the hall was second to none.\n\n\u201cI have been watching the past Sun Awards on television and I have always admired it. This is my first time to participate and my respect for The Sun has increased. From what I have seen so far, it shows that no other awards can beat The Sun,\u201d he said.\n\nSetting the tone of the event was the Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of the Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh. He noted that the event was a celebration of Nigerians who, despite COVID-19, excelled when success looked impossible. They blazed the trail and stood to be counted last year.\n\n\u201cTheir achievements tell the story of the true Nigerian spirit of fighting for success, even in difficult situations. The 24 award winners are made of sterner stuff. They are resourceful, dogged, resilient, strategic and focused. They could pass for conquerors of COVID-19, having excelled in their respective endeavours at a difficult time,\u201d he stated.\n\nMaintaining that the award remains the biggest media event in Nigeria and Africa, Ukeh noted that like a mustard seed, it has continued to grow 18 years after its debut. He commended the awardees for applying winning strategies and recording outstanding successes despite the effect of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFrom the list, we can see that the award winners cut across all sectors; all strata of the society. They did well in governance, public service, entrepreneurship, entertainment, hospitality, industrialisation, philanthropy and humanity. I most warmly congratulate the award winners,\u201d he said.\n\nHe equally noted that the selection of deputy governors for the award is evidence that they are not spare tyres as some people may want to believe. \u201cIt is how they are deployed that makes the difference,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Neya Orji Uzor Kalu, who spoke on behalf of her father and Publisher of the Sun Publishing Limited, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, commended the awardees for being singled out among millions of Nigerians for the award, saying it was a great feat.\n\nShe said they deserved the award following their accomplishments, even as she urged them to remain consistent in their individual endeavours.\n\nShe also reminded them that to whom much is given, much is expected, and urged them to work together and live in peace for the progress of the country.\n\nShe regretted that the award could not be held last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the world and brought economic hardship to many countries, including Nigeria.\n\nShe paid tribute to all the frontline workers in the fight to contain Coronavirus, even as she called on all to remember those that were lost to the pandemic, as well as those that were lost to the senseless killings in Nigeria.\n\nChairman of the event was Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha. He was represented by the Minister of Sports and Youths Development, Sunday Dare.\n\nIn his speech, he acknowledged that the event kept getting better with every passing year. He commended The Sun Management for putting together such a wonderful programme.\n\nGlitz and fun\n\nThe night was not only about handing out awards and honours to those who deserved them; it was also a time to relax to some good music and comedy by some talented Nigerian entertainers. It was a lot of fun. One of Africa\u2019s finest musicians, Kingsley Chinweike Okonkwo, popularly known as Kcee, didn\u2019t disappoint the audience. The sonorous melody of his scintillating tunes pierced through the hearts of the audience who, amid thunderous cheers, jumped on their feet and danced along with him.\n\nAside from Kcee\u2019s soothing songs, popular comedian, Koffi dished out several rib-cracking jokes that got people laughing hilariously.\n\nOn hand to also colour the occasion was the Shuga Band Crew members, who entertained the audience with their soul-lifting songs intermittently all through the programme.\n\nThe event kicked off proper at 7:44pm with the Master of Ceremonies (MC), a stand-up comedian, Gbenga Adeyinka, quickly setting out the rules that guided how the awardees conducted themselves as they approved the stage to receive the awards.\n\nHonour for the deserving\n\nFour sitting governors, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Abdulahi Ganduje of Kano State, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, received various awards for their achievements in the last one year.\n\nWike clinched the Sun Man of the Year, Ganduje and Bello got the Sun Governor of the Year, while Buni grabbed the Political Icon of the Year.\n\nApart from those who have distinguished themselves in governance, there was an award for the Exceptional Philanthropist of the Year. The award went to two individuals, who were singled out for their philanthropy and large-heartedness in reaching out to the needy and downtrodden.\n\nThey are the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema; and a multi-billionaire businessman and Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Holdings Limited, Dr. Adedeji Adeleke.\n\nThe Entrepreneurship of the Year also went to two personalities who have done well in that regard. They are the Chairman of Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc, Dr. Ambrose Bryant Chukwueloka Orjiako; and the Chief Executive Officer of SLOT Systems Limited, Nnamdi Ezeigbo.\n\nAlhaji Mustapha Ado and Chief Ebuka Onunkwo clinched the Sun Industrialist of the Year, while the Hospitality Icon of the Year went to Chief Obinna Iyiegbu, popularly called Obi Cubana.\n\nThe Sun Lifetime Achievement Award went to four distinguished and respected Nigerians. They are Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, Chief Olabode George, Professor George Obiozor, and Mr. Moses Ekpo.\n\nThe Sun Public Service of the Year award went to three distinguished Nigerians in the persons of Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig-Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd); Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim; and the Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji.\n\nThe Sun Investor of the Year Award was bestowed on two Nigerians \u2013 Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Marco Polo Group, High Chief Frank Okafor; and Chairman of the Mainland Oil Limited, Dr. Chris Igwe.\n\nThe Sports Personality of the Year went to the Edo State Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shuaibu; while the Nollywood titan, Kanayo .O. Kanayo, received the Nollwood Icon of the Year award.\n\nHowever, the only female in the pack was the wife of the Ondo State Governor, Mrs. Betty Anyanwu Akeredolu, who was found worthy to wear the crown of The Sun Most Supportive First Lady of the Year. Indeed, it was a long list of 24 eminent Nigerians who have impacted lives in various areas of human endeavours during the year under review.\n\nThe event came to an end about 11. 30 pm, but some guests still loitered within the hall, savouring the aesthetics of the hall and the ambience that the exciting evening offered.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "EndSARS: One year after fire and fury: What we lost and continue to lose \u2013 Victims",
          "text": "By Lawrence Enyoghasu\n\nAfter the rain comes the sunshine, so goes the saying.\n\nBut Saturday Sun findings show that it is not yet sunshine for those whose property and means of livelihood were destroyed during the #ENDSARS protest that rocked the nation to its foundation this time last year. As the nation marks the first anniversary of what has been tagged Nigeria\u2019s version of the 1989 Beijing Tiananmen Square Massacre, hundreds of those who lost lives, property and means of livelihoods during the protest are still counting their losses. You will probably never be able to capture all their stories.\n\nThis time last year, Nigerian youths took to the streets of Lagos and other states to protest against the alleged atrocious activities and inhumane treatment of a notorious crime-fighting police unit dubbed Special Anti-Robbery Squad. Simply known as SARS, it has since been proscribed following the riot. In the beginning, the protest, held in different places in Lagos, including Lekki Tollgate, was peaceful until the early hours of October 20, 2020.\n\nAs it turned out, on that day, nobody knew what was in the offing, what the day was going to bring forth until it unfurled its wings of anger, and destruction of lives and property and attendant pains that lasted for hours and days. Many are still reeling from the aftermath, and are yet to heal from it one year later. In any case, virtually everyone, especially in Lagos, was affected, one way or the other. Roads were blocked; cars and buses burnt; shops looted, families robbed, and police stations razed.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nTales from lawmaker and seller of phone accessories\n\nAccording to Hon. Jude Chukwuemeka Idimogu, Chairman of Lagos State House of Assembly, Wealth Creation Committee, it will take years for the state and its people to recover from their losses. \u201cIt was like a watershed in the history of Lagos State,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt was a calamity to the economy. There was destruction everywhere. The process started very well until it was hijacked. It has taken us back and must be avoided. It has affected the creation of wealth in the state. When I remember it, I feel for the victims.\u201d\n\nOne of those victims is Andy Uche, a phone accessories retailer at Mushin. On that fateful day, someone called him up at about 5 am. He jumped up from the bed, half-dressed, to attend to the call. He never imagined the shock that awaited him till he got to his shop located at Olu Aina Street to find the doors wide open. He looked but there were no goods inside. Curious, he asked if there was any fire outbreak within that area that necessitated some good Samaritans moving his goods to a safer place. But he was shocked beyond words to learn that there was nothing like that.\n\n\u201cI was pained when I was told that I was part of the people whose shops were broken into and their goods carried away,\u201d he said. \u201cI stood speechless for hours, opening and closing my eyes and praying for it to be a bad dream. I later burst into tears and wept till I could cry no more. I lost goods were worth N5 million. To make matters worse, I was planning to get married when the incident happened. But I thank God that my wife stood by me.\u201d\n\nOther affected phone-related companies include SLOT System Ltd, Piatek, and Mac Centre. Oghenerukewe Oghenetega, a sales representative for Mac Centre, told the story of how the firm\u2019s Surulere store was looted and left bare. There was no item left, not even a pin. He informed: \u201cWe have two stores: one here and another on the Lagos Island. A lot of things wouldn\u2019t have been stolen if there had not been the protest and negligence from some of our staff. The hoodlums stole everything without leaving any stone unturned.\u201d Asked to quantify their losses, he said: \u201cSincerely, it has not been easy for us.\n\nThe protest, attacks, and looting were a big setback.\u201d He added that some of his former co-workers left the job due to the incident. Moreover, it opened his eyes to some insurance gimmicks.\n\nHe remarked: \u201cSome of them (his co-workers) stopped by themselves since they were not working. It took about four months before we could resume. The looting opened our eyes to a lot of insurance measures. It has made us work on our security system. Now, everybody is alert. Everybody now checks on everything like the locks before leaving.\u201d\n\nHe warned that any fresh protests in commemoration of the incident must be allowed to degenerate into looting.\n\n\u201cIf it is about the protests and why they\u2019re protesting, I support them. But the looting, I don\u2019t support because there are better ways one can do this thing without causing some pain to others. Even myself, I would have loved to join them but not everybody has the time,\u201d he said.\n\nLooting of pharmacy and gift shop\n\nThe looters were after not only what they could get and use but also what they didn\u2019t need. For instance, they attacked pharmacies not because they were sick and needed some drugs to cure themselves with. Neither did they even know what many of the drugs were meant for. They only attacked out of simple greed and the passion to destroy. One of the pharmacies was Health Plus, a sister company to Casa Bella.\n\nA check by Saturday Sun shows that it took the firm a long time to open after the protest that took place in Surulere resulted in the mindless looting of the place. Even so, its sister company has continued to remain closed. Till this day, the memory of what happened that day is still fresh in the mind of Destiny, one of Health Plus workers. He said that it took the company three months to reopen.\n\nThe experience was really traumatic, he admitted. \u201cWe never expected such. The looting was beyond imagination. Imagine people taking drugs they don\u2019t know anything about. They didn\u2019t just take the drugs; they broke into our safe.\u201d\n\nThough some companies and business outfits laid off workers following the development, Destiny said his firm did no such thing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sack any staff,\u201d he explained. \u201cThough our sister company closed down because of the looting, its staff were sent to other branches. That\u2019s how they are still able to get their pay cheques at the end of the month. The sister company is still closed down. We have to move all the products in Casa Bella to this place. It took us three months to come back, to open the shop because we have to put one or two things in place.\u201d\n\nCards Place, a gift shop located in Surulere, was also looted. In fact, it was torn apart. According to Omotayo Yetunde, the General Manager of the company, the looting came to them as a big shock because they took what they considered a precautionary measure by closing earlier to allow the management to lock down the complex. This followed a directive to that effect, given by the management of Leisure Mall, its parent company. Yet the looters found their way into the semi-fortress.\n\nOne year later, her recollection of the incident is as vividly drawn as the stripes of the African Zebra. She said: \u201cOn the October 19, everybody was at work. Not quite long, they brought a memo that we should close early and we left the place around 12pm. The following day, which was October 20, we were at home and saw people protesting on TV the killings at Lekki Tollgate. We never knew that we were going to be affected in a bad way. Then on the 21st, we heard that they looted our shops at midnight, carting away our money and goods. I can\u2019t give you an estimate of what we lost because I\u2019m just a manager here. What I can say is that it was a very bad experience. It is not easy to forget. It was not easy to pick up our pieces from where the ugly experience left us. Though we eventually resumed service in the first week of December, last year, things have not been the same. Some customers are still afraid to patronize us; some won\u2019t come because they fear for their safety. What the management has now done is to mount a big iron roller shutter at the main gate.\u201d\n\nEatery workers and others tell stories of horror\n\nThe experience of workers at a branch of Chicken Republic, a popular eatery, is in no way different. Accounts show that the looters were deliberate and methodical with what they did. Among them must have been first-rate criminals because they did not only make away with their sweet-smelling and tantalizing packaged meals, but also disconnected their CCTV cables, obviously, to avoid being caught in the act.\n\n\u201cAt the time it happened, we lost almost everything,\u201d a source who did not want his name in print said. \u201cThe glass was broken. Two different machines were taken. We lost all the computers in the office. We lost three air conditioners. They even came through the roof to disconnect all the electrical and electronic cables. It was as if they had some personal scores to settle with us. What they could not take, they destroyed. About six bags of chicken were taken from our freezer room. The amount runs into millions of naira because we had nothing less than 60 bags. It took some months before we could come back. The office was first shut down for renovation. We opened this place in January. Because of the widespread looting and destruction that took place here, we didn\u2019t have any sales during last Christmas.\u201d\n\nChicken Republic is not the only company whose losses run into millions. Organizations like the Lekki Concession Company, the concessionaire of the Lekki Tollgate in Lagos, is said to have recorded the loss of over N2.5bn in revenue collections since the end of the #EndSARS protest in October 2020. Yomi Omomuwasan, the Managing Director of the company, disclosed this fact at a recent press briefing.\n\nThe Lagos State government also lost 23 of its long Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles said to cost $200,000 each, in the Oyingbo and Ojodu Berger areas of the state, and 57 medium-size of them costing $100,000 each, all totalling about N3.9 billion. It lost it to the wild orgies of arson and destruction that followed the killings at Lekki Tollgate. Primero Transport Services Ltd (PRT), owners of BRT buses lost over N100 million in six days due to the #EndSARS protests.\n\nThe State\u2019s Commissioner for Information, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, who disclosed these facts, said that a total of 80 buses were destroyed. \u201cHowever, the cumulative losses incurred by the state are not ready yet. But it will be mind-boggling. It came on a scale beyond belief,\u201d he stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "Igbo leaders in fresh moves to free Kanu",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThe appearance in court of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, has saved the nation, especially the South-East further crisis, several Igbo leaders have noted.\n\nSaturday Sun was informed that Kanu\u2019s appearance in court has particularly saved the South East dark clouds and shelved a \u2018season of damnation\u2019 for the region. IPOB, which had declared sit-at-home any day its leader would be appearing in court, had also threatened a full month lockdown of the zone if the Federal Government failed to produce Kanu in court. The IPOB leader is facing trial for treasonable and seditious charges. He was renditioned from Kenya by the Federal Government over three months ago and detained at the facility of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nHe was not in court during the next adjourned date, fuelling different insinuations. Saturday Sun gathered reliably that South East Governors had advised the Federal Government that the release of Kanu was key to the de-escalation of tension in the region.\n\nThis newspaper had reported of secret meetings between some South East Governors and the IPOB leader, including the recent promise by Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, to ensure that Kanu as an Abia citizen got justice. It was also gathered that several Igbo leaders have continued to push for political solution to the issue.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nOhanaeze, the apex Igbo sociocultural organization, said Kanu\u2019s appearance in court on Thursday was some form of big win. The group noted that it would help to de-escalate tension in the region while attributing the success to the diplomatic astuteness of its leadership under Prof. George Obiozor (President-General) and Okey Emuchay (Secretary-General), both accomplished diplomats.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said it was one step forward in Ohanaeze\u2019s determined moves towards ensuring that the IPOB leader was set free in no distant time.\n\nOhanaeze had dispatched a high-powered delegation consisting of former governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife; the Ezeigbo I of Abuja, Nwosu Ibe and a senior legal practitioner, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, which was in court to monitor the proceedings and report back to its leadership.\n\nOgbonnia said: \u201cWe are unrelenting in our resolve to ensure that the FG toes the path of wisdom by conceding to the proposal for dialogue and Alternative Dispute Resolution which will ensure the unconditional freedom of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and all members of IPOB detained across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObiozor had in his inaugural speech on January 20, 2021, called on the Presidency to consider dialogue as a panacea to peace, insisting that the jackboot approach to the IPOB uprising will rather aggravate the precarious situation.\n\nEarlier in the week, former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, had in a statement signed by his media adviser, Uche Anichukwu, given assurances that the South East Caucus of the National Assembly, where he serves as the leader, was also working towards defusing tension in the region, as well as finding a political solution that would result in the release of Kanu.\n\nLeader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Uchenna Madu had warned that Kanu\u2019s absence in court would bring devastating destruction to Nigeria as, according to him, \u201cit will be a proof of evidence that he has been killed in DSS detention cage. Nigeria government should know what it means and the follow up reaction if Nnamdi Kanu is denied his physical appearance in the court.\u201d\n\nCoalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) expressed happiness that the IPOB leader was brought to court, but it expressed displeasure with the handling of the issues. Its President-General, Goodluck Ibem said, however, that with the development, \u201cthere will be no need again for the one month sit-at-home threat by IPOB.\u201d\n\nAlaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) spokesman, Abia Onyike said the self-determination struggle of the Igbo Nation was the most progressive step in overcoming the present crisis which has bedevilled the chaotic Nigerian federation, following decades of injustice, oppression and suppression of the legitimate rights of Ndigbo as a major ethnic nationality in Nigeria. On its part, IPOB has saluted the roles played by some persons and groups, culminating in the appearance of its leader in court on Thursday.\n\nThe group hinted that it would not go into any form of negotiation without the unconditional release of its leader and a date fixed for Biafra referendum. IPOB\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful said those who played roles in producing Kanu in court had done Nigeria and DSS some great service, noting that they listened to wise counsel.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Links Igboho to Boko Haram\u2019s sponsor\n\nMay pardon Saro-Wiwa, 8 others as part of Ogoni\u2019s integration\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday blamed the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, who is on trial for treason, for the murder of Chike Akunyili, the husband of the late Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof. Dora Akunyili.\n\nThe government also said it had established a link between Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, and a Boko Haram sponsor, Surajo Muhammad, who was jailed in the United Arab Emirates on charges of financing terrorism.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), made these allegations yesterday while unveiling the findings of a Presidential Committee set up to investigate Kanu and Ighoho.\n\nThe 24-member committee, headed by Malami, had representatives from the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Federal Ministry of Information, the Nigeria Police Force, the Department of State Services, the National Intelligence Agency and the Defence Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe government further accused Kanu of being responsible for the murder of a former Presidential Aide, Ahmad Gulak, and over 177 others in the South-East.\n\nThe committee said consequent upon the instigating directives of Kanu, members of IPOB and the Eastern Security Network carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions, especially facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201cwith a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt said the attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 led to the killing of 175 security personnel.\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cThat on October 21, 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out, and security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cThat 175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives.\n\n\u201cRecently, there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. AnayochukwuDurueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community, as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others, as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on May 30, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe committee found out that as a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were 19 attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices and burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\nThe Presidential Committee stated that 164 police stations and formations, including police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN, leading to the death of 128 policemen while 144 were injured and 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIt said 396 firearms and 17,738 ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks.\n\n\u201cThat there were three IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service, including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where 1,841 inmates escaped; that the Headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one officer,\u201d the report read.\n\nLinks Igboho to Boko Haram\u2019s Sponsor\n\nThe Committee also claimed to have established a link between Igboho, and the convicted Boko Haram sponsor, Surajo Muhammad.\n\nGovernment further alleged that between 2013 and 2020, Igboho received N127 million from several financiers, including a federal lawmaker. The government refused to reveal the identity of the lawmaker.\n\nMalami said, \u201cThe report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on April 23, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in nine banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a federal lawmaker in the National Assembly. A total sum of N127,145,000 was received by Igboho from his financiers between October 22, 2013, and September 28, 2020, through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between March 15, 2013, and March 11, 2021. Investigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12,750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\u201d\n\nThe AGF noted that Abbal Bako and Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Usman, \u201care suspects\u201d in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation.\n\n\u201cAbdullahi Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to Surajo Abubakar Muhammad (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram). This report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country,\u201d Malami said.\n\nMalami stated that having received the reports, the federal government \u201cremains solute\u201d in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe federal government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is given the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari: FG May Pardon Ken Saro-Wiwa, 8 Others\n\nThe killing of Ogoni activist and renowned playwright, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others (Ogoni 9) in November, 1995 during the Abacha administration reechoed yesterday as President Buhari disclosed that the federal government might consider granting pardon to the Ogoni 9 as part of moves to genuinely integrate the Ogoni people.\n\nThis is just as President Buhari urged Ogoni leaders to sensitise their people on why they must value protection of pipelines and national assets in their area.\n\nThe President spoke while playing host to Ogoni leaders, led by Gbenemene Tai and President of the Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers, His Majesty King Godwin N.K. Giniwa at the State House, Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring clemency and national integration as part of this Administration\u2019s bid to lay the foundation for genuine reconciliation and bring closure to the issues of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate incidents of the early 1990s leading to the loss of lives of distinguished sons of Ogoni Land and the collateral judicial processes are indelible in our memories.\n\n\u201cDespite the grievous circumstances, the federal government will consider the request for the grant of pardon to finally close the Ogoni saga.\u201d\n\nRecall that Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were accused of killing four fellow Ogonis, leading to their arrest and trial by a military tribunal which found them guilty and accordingly sentenced them to death by hanging.\n\nKen Saro-Wiwa along with eight others namely Saturday Dobee, NorduEawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, BariborBera, BarinemKiobel, and John Kpuine, were executed by hanging on November 10, 1995 and buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery in Rivers State capital.\n\nHe said the government would bring to a close all pending issues on sons of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highnesses, distinguished representatives of the people of Ogoni Land, I note the need to ensure completion of segment of the East-West road traversing Ogoni Land, and steps will be taken to ensure delivery under the Infrastructure Development Fund as earlier conceived. We intend to complete this vital artery of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Ltd (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), had been granted license to operate OML11, which will stimulate economic activities and integration in the zone.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, NNPC is hereby directed to engage all host communities, particularly Ogoni people to ensure inclusive processing of oil and gas, anchored on optimum involvement of host communities. NPDC will lay a broad-based programme for the emergence of a new Ogoni Land for the benefit of the Ogoni people and Nigeria as a whole,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, King Godwin N.K. Giniwa, thanked President Buhari for various interventions in the area, particularly on clean-up of the environment.\n\nThe paramount ruler noted that the people believe in the unity of Nigeria and the future of every group could only be guaranteed in one nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe October 30 and 31 national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is now threatened as lawyer to the suspended national chairman of party, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), has written a letter to the principal officers of the party as well as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) to stop the planned convention as there was a pending appeal against the convention in the Court of Appeal.\n\nIn a letter by Oyetibo dated October 21, 2021, addressed to the following officers of the party: The PDP Acting National Chairman, the Chairman, PDP National Convention Committee, the PDP National Organising Secretary, the PDP National Legal Adviser and the PDP National Secretary C/O Chief E.O Oddey, Odey and Odey Solicitors of above address Suite 120-122 Pan Bank Building No. 2 Forces Avenue, Old GRA Port Harcourt.\n\nOyetibo said that CA/PH/341/2021: Prince Uche Secondus V Ibeawuchi E. Alex & ORS and the pendency of the application for injunction to restrain the holding of the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe act for the Appellant in the above captioned matter, Prince Uche Secondus, who was the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), prior to the institution of Suit Number PHC/218 3/CS/202I, and wish to bring to your attention the following facts:\n\n\u201cOn 23 August 2021 one Mr. lbeawuchi E. Alex and four others jointly instituted Suit No PHC/2183 /CS/202I at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division against Prince Uche Secondus and the PDP as Defendants.\n\n\u201cOn I0 September 2021, the High Court of Rivers State delivered its judgment in the suit whereby Prince Uche Secondus was, inter alia, restrained from performing the functions of the office of National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAn appeal has been filed and entered against the judgment at the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Judicial Division.\n\nIn addition, an Application on Notice has been filed in which Prince Uche Secondus is seeking, inter alia, the following orders,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nAccording to Secondus\u2019s lawyer, \u201cAn Order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 Respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nOyetibo said that alternative to above that \u201cAn Order that the parties to this appeal, particularly the Appellant /Applicant and the 6th Respondent (Peoples Democratic Party) shall maintain the status quo ante as at 22 August 2021, when Appellant/Applicant was occupying the office of National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\n\n\u201cThe application has since been served on you and other Respondents in the appeal.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the service of the Application for injunction, it has come to the Notice of our client that the PDP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the National Convention on 30 and 3 I October 2021,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to Oyetiba, \u201cThis letter is intended to draw your attention to the position of the law of Nigeria on this subject as encapsulated in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the celebrated case of Governor of Lagos State vs. Chief Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (1 986) I NWLR (Part 18) 621 @ 637, in which the court, reviewed various decisions on the point, and approved the following principles as the correct position of the law, that is:\n\n\u201cThe rule is well settled \u2026 .. .. that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and determination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued .. .. . ..\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merit s as they may be ultimately decided.\u201d\n\nHe explained in the letter that the same position was taken by the Court of Appeal in Chief Elias Okeke-Oba vs. Ikwuka Okoye (1994) 8 NWLR (364) 605 @ 617- 61 8, where the court said as follows:\n\n\u201cThe general practice is that on application for an order for interlocutory injunction, all activities affecting the res, are automatically terminated as a mark of respect to the court before whom the application is pending\u2026. if\u2026 parties to the suit senselessly rush their tortious trespassory activities\u2026 in the spacious belief that that would promote their unfounded claims to the res. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Such heedless posture is, to say the least, a fragrant disrespect to the court. It clearly, in my opinion, amounts to intransigence for a party against whom an order for injunction is sought to intensify his interference with the rest\u2026 The court cannot be hoodwinked by such impropriety of unlawful acts in relation to the rest nor can the person in such disrespect be allowed to take advantage of his default and flagrant intransigence.\u201d\n\nHe said that the logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts was that having been served with an application seeking to restrain the holding of its National Convention pending the determination of the appeal filed by Prince Uche Secondus, the PDP would be embarking upon a collision course with the court if it proceeds to hold the National Convention before the hearing and determination of the Application.\n\n\u201cShould such contumacious conduct of holding the National Convention before the hearing and determination of the Application be embarked upon by the party however, we shall not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law against all national officers of the party that are responsible for such conduct of contempt of court.\n\n\u201cQuite apart from the fact that such contumacious conduct would impinge on the integrity of the party, we would on our part, swiftly take steps to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to nullify any decision, action or step taken at such Convention,\u201d Secondus lawyer said.\n\nIn view of his letter, Oyetiba said, \u201cWe trust that you will wisely advise the Peoples Democratic Party and its officers in this regard.

          "text": "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, I welcome you to this very important press conference.\n\nAs you are aware Nnamdi Kanu, the self-acclaimed leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been at the center of a subversive campaign against the Nigerian State. Consequently, Nnamdi Kanu was arrested on 14th October, 2015. He was charged to court for treasonable felony, among other crimes. He was granted bail by the Federal High Court, Abuja on 25th April 2017. He however breached the bail conditions and fled abroad.\n\nWhile in self-exile, Nnamdi Kanu intensified his subversive campaign, using online Radio Biafra to instigate violence and incite members of IPOB to commit violent attacks against civil and democratic institutions, particularly the security personnel, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and civilians. He instigated the destruction of public and private properties across the country.\n\nAs a result of these criminal activities, IPOB was proscribed and designated a terrorist organization by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in an Order made on 20th September 2017.\n\nDespite the proscription of IPOB by the Federal Government, Nnamdi Kanu continued the subversive campaign, instigating and inciting broadcasts to direct members of the IPOB to launch attacks on government.\n\nThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities.\n\nAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down Police stations, Correctional centers, INEC offices, bus terminals, the Palace of Oba of Lagos, Banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\n\nOn 12th December, 2020, Eastern Security Network\u201d (ESN) was formed by Nnamdi Kanu as an armed wing of IPOB with the mandate to advance the nefarious agenda of the outlawed group. ESN continued to launch attacks on security personnel, civilians perceived as enemies as well as destruction of private and public properties.\n\nThe destructive activities of IPOB/ESN pose serious threat to Nigeria\u2019s National Security and its corporate existence, which resulted into re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and members of his group.\n\nThe eventual re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu in June 2021, and some members of his group led to the inauguration of a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee, comprising twenty-four (24) members drawn from:\n\n1. Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ),\n\n2. Federal Ministry of Information (MoI),\n\n3. Nigeria Police Force (NPF),\n\n4. Department of State Services (DSS),\n\n5. National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and\n\n6. Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA),\n\nThe Committee, inaugurated by the President, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), was headed by the Honorable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Committee finds as a fact, that consequent upon the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, members of IPOB/ESN carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions especially INEC Facilities with a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria. These attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 include the following:\n\nI. That acting on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including Police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\nII. That on 21st October 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill Government security forces, which was carried out and several Security personnel (especially Police Officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\nIII. One hundred and seventy-five (175) security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising one hundred and twenty eight (128) Police men, thirty seven (37) military personnel and ten (10) other security operatives;\n\nIV. Killing of prominent Nigerians, (recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on 30th May. 2021);\n\nV. That as a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were nineteen (19) attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of eighteen (18) INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo States;\n\nVI. That one hundred and sixty-four (164) police stations and formations, including Police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one hundred and twenty-eight (128) police men {as stated in III above}; one hundred forty four (144) injured while six hundred twenty eight (628) vehicles were destroyed.\n\nVII. That three hundred and ninety-six (396) firearms and seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty eight (17,738) ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks;\n\nVIII. That there were three (3) IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where one thousand eight hundred and forty one (1,841) inmates escaped;\n\nIX. That the Headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one (1) officer;\n\nX. That there were several IPOB/ESN attacks and destruction (arson) of public and private properties during the EndSARS and Biafra agitations across the country, especially in the South-East and South-South regions, notably the Palace of the Oba of Lagos where twelve\n\n(12) flats were completely looted and vandalized, the country home of the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, was burnt, over one hundred and fifty (150) buses burnt at the Lagos Bus Terminal, Sen. Ndoma Egba\u2019s home in Calabar Municipal, Cross River State, was completely looted and vandalized, Lagos State DNA and Forensic Centre, City Hall Race Course, First Bank Branch Lagos, Lagos State Public Works Commission, Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Marina, Lagos, High Court Igbosere, Lagos, were all burnt, amongst other heinous crimes committed.\n\nWe have also established that KANU is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria. Some of the state actors aided KANU, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\nWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by KANU and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people. Conversely, there are some friendly countries which, recognising the status of IPOB as a terrorist organization, have either banned the activities of IPOB or placed KANU on Stop List. To these peace loving countries that have put KANU on their Stop Lists and banned IPOB from operating in their territories, we express our appreciation.\n\nSimilarly, the Federal Government has received the report on financers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho. The report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\nThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Law Maker in the National Assembly. A total sum of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION, ONE AND FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND NAIRA ONLY (N127, 145,000.00) was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\nA total sum of TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THREE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT THOUSAND, TWO HUNDRED NAIRA ONLY (N273,198,200.00) transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11 the March, 2021.\n\nInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of twelve million seven hundred and fifty thousand naira (N12, 750,000) to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\nIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation. Abdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism [Boko Haram]).\n\nThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country.\n\nThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\n\nHaving received the reports, the Federal Government remains solute in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria. The Federal Government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is giving the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nI thank you most sincerely.\n\nAbubakar Malami, SAN Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am informed by my staff and very reliable people that he was the object of that attack last night at about 10pm,\u201d one of the top source said.\n\n\u201cThe rest was just drama. My security staff told me the gunmen struck three days ago on the Oyo-Ogbomosho Road and around that time, their strange faces were also seen around an area the boys described to me. This was a well-coordinated attack with the objective to free Wakili and other Fulani inmates,\u201d he added.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the entrance to the prison was blown with an explosive device while security officials at the prison fled for their safety.\n\nBREAKING: Gunmen Attack Oyo Correctional Facility With Explosives, Set Inmates Free | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/OwtGaC1pAg pic.twitter.com/ufxPU73MEl \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) October 23, 2021\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters on phone, the spokesman of the NCS, Olanrewaju Anjorin, had said; \u201cYes. It has been confirmed that the attack actually happened. And right now, the Comptroller of Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) and other top officers are assessing the situation. But I can confirm to you that the incident actually happened.\"\n\nOn March 7, a joint team of Ibarapa security operatives, including the Oodua Peoples Congress, Vigilante, and other groups had arrested the notorious Fulani warlord terrorising Oyo communities, Wakili.\n\nWakili had been arrested after several attempts resulting in a gun battle.\n\nThere had been reports that Wakili and his gang were involved in the killings and kidnapping of several people in Ibarapa, Oke Ogun, Oyo State.\n\nWakili was nabbed barely seven days after his second-in-command, Isiaka Muhammadu, was arrested alongside four others.\n\nThe Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, had confirmed Wakili\u2019s arrest in a statement.\n\nOn June 7, no fewer than 17 persons were reportedly shot dead by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen at Igangan, in the Ibarapa North LGA.\n\nResidents had said the hoodlums invaded the town on motorcycles around 11pm in an attack which continued until around 3am on Sunday.\n\nThey had fingered Wakili\u2019s men on a revenge mission to be behind the attack.\n\nAt daybreak, residents reportedly saw corpses of children and adults littered some places in the town, while houses and vehicles, including a truck loaded with cassava flour, were razed by the attackers.\n\nThe Convener, Igangan Development Advocates, Oladiran Oladokun, had said the gunmen set fire to houses to drive out the people, after which they opened fire on them.\n\nHe said the government did not take the security seriously, adding that they had reported that the herdsmen were planning to attack them.",

          "text": "In October 2020, Nigerians took to the streets to protest against police brutality, especially involving officers of the now-disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe #EndSARS movement \u2014 which actually started a few years before the 2020 protest \u2014 went into full swing from October 7, 2020 with demonstrations across major cities in the country.\n\nThe protests gained widespread acceptance both on the streets and on social media as celebrities added their voices in support of the movement.\n\nOn October 11, 2020, Adamu Mohammed, the former inspector-general of police, announced the disbandment of SARS, and on the same day, the protesters presented a five-point demand to the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, despite the disbandment of SARS, the protests continued and was later hijacked by hoodlums.\n\nIn the days between October 9 and October 22, 2020, while peaceful demonstrations continued in parts of the country, violent attacks were unleashed on protesters, passers-by, security agents, motorists, among other categories of persons. Private and public facilities \u2014 including police stations, courts, prisons and media houses \u2014 across the country were also vandalised by hoodlums.\n\nThe development led to a declaration of curfew by some state governments in a bid to curtail the violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the protests, hundreds of arrests were made but there were declarations by government officials in some states for several persons to be released.\n\nHowever, some persons remained in custody for various categories of offences linked to the protests.\n\nIn June, there were reports that Kemisola Ogunniyi, an 18-year-old lady who was arrested in October 2020 in Ondo, gave birth at the Surulere prison in the state.\n\nShe was said to have been arrested by soldiers for allegedly participating in the setting ablaze of the All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat in Akure, the state capital. She and others were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit arson, stealing and malicious damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days after the story went viral, Ogunniyi regained her freedom, after being granted bail.\n\nOgunniyi\u2019s experience brings to the fore the cases of some persons who are still in custody over their alleged involvement in offences relating to the protest.\n\nROBERT KPANOU\n\nKpanou, a Beninese, was said to have been arrested on October 22, 2020 by officers attached to Marako police station, while he was returning home from work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was arrested after being accused of stealing items from a looted supermarket nearby. He was taken to the Area A command on Lagos island and arraigned at the Yaba magistrate\u2019s court on November 3, 2020.\n\nAt the magistrate\u2019s court, he was remanded in Kirikiri prison while awaiting the advice of the Lagos state director of public prosecution.\n\nOn September 24, Kpanou appeared before the Yaba magistrate court, but the magistrate was absent. The case was consequently moved to December 17.\n\nNINE ARRESTED IN OYO\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, Adesina Ademuyiwa was said to have been arrested in his Ibadan residence in Oyo state, for allegedly participating in the violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests.\n\nSince his arrest, Adekemi Adesina, the suspect\u2019s sister, has been using social media to demand justice for her brother.\n\nOthers being tried alongside Ademuyiwa are Ikechukwu Eze, Ariyo Afeez, Taoreed Abiodun, Adekunle Moruf, Rasheed Tiamiyu, Ariyo Sodiq, Oyewole Olumide, and Ikenna Amaechi.\n\nThe suspects, who were arraigned in July 2021, have pleaded not guilty to the five-count charge bordering on alleged murder, arson and theft.\n\nSpeaking to TheCable on the development, Adekemi said the suspects have remained in custody since they were arrested, while the case was not heard in court at the last sitting on September 27.\n\nAccording to her, she was told that the case has been transferred to another judge.\n\nSUNDAY OKORO\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Okoro, a commercial driver, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the vandalism of the Orile police station in Lagos.\n\nHe was said to have been spotted in the background of a picture depicting hoodlums destroying the police station.\n\nFestus Ogun, counsel representing Okoro, told TheCable that after a series of court appearances, the driver was granted bail.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Okoro\u2019s wife has not been able to meet the bail conditions which include three sureties with tax clearance in the past three years. The driver is also said to be the breadwinner of the family.\n\nThe suspect is still in Kirikiri prison \u2014 10 months after his arrest \u2014 and the next court sitting on the case is December 8.",

          "text": "In October 2020, Nigerians took to the streets to protest against police brutality, especially involving officers of the now-disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe #EndSARS movement \u2014 which actually started a few years before the 2020 protest \u2014 went into full swing from October 7, 2020 with demonstrations across major cities in the country.\n\nThe protests gained widespread acceptance both on the streets and on social media as celebrities added their voices in support of the movement.\n\nOn October 11, 2020, Adamu Mohammed, the former inspector-general of police, announced the disbandment of SARS, and on the same day, the protesters presented a five-point demand to the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, despite the disbandment of SARS, the protests continued and was later hijacked by hoodlums.\n\nIn the days between October 9 and October 22, 2020, while peaceful demonstrations continued in parts of the country, violent attacks were unleashed on protesters, passers-by, security agents, motorists, among other categories of persons. Private and public facilities \u2014 including police stations, courts, prisons and media houses \u2014 across the country were also vandalised by hoodlums.\n\nThe development led to a declaration of curfew by some state governments in a bid to curtail the violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the protests, hundreds of arrests were made but there were declarations by government officials in some states for several persons to be released.\n\nHowever, some persons remained in custody for various categories of offences linked to the protests.\n\nIn June, there were reports that Kemisola Ogunniyi, an 18-year-old lady who was arrested in October 2020 in Ondo, gave birth at the Surulere prison in the state.\n\nShe was said to have been arrested by soldiers for allegedly participating in the setting ablaze of the All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat in Akure, the state capital. She and others were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit arson, stealing and malicious damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days after the story went viral, Ogunniyi regained her freedom, after being granted bail.\n\nOgunniyi\u2019s experience brings to the fore the cases of some persons who are still in custody over their alleged involvement in offences relating to the protest.\n\nROBERT KPANOU\n\nKpanou, a Beninese, was said to have been arrested on October 22, 2020 by officers attached to Marako police station, while he was returning home from work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was arrested after being accused of stealing items from a looted supermarket nearby. He was taken to the Area A command on Lagos island and arraigned at the Yaba magistrate\u2019s court on November 3, 2020.\n\nAt the magistrate\u2019s court, he was remanded in Kirikiri prison while awaiting the advice of the Lagos state director of public prosecution.\n\nOn September 24, Kpanou appeared before the Yaba magistrate court, but the magistrate was absent. The case was consequently moved to December 17.\n\nNINE ARRESTED IN OYO\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, Adesina Ademuyiwa was said to have been arrested in his Ibadan residence in Oyo state, for allegedly participating in the violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests.\n\nSince his arrest, Adekemi Adesina, the suspect\u2019s sister, has been using social media to demand justice for her brother.\n\nOthers being tried alongside Ademuyiwa are Ikechukwu Eze, Ariyo Afeez, Taoreed Abiodun, Adekunle Moruf, Rasheed Tiamiyu, Ariyo Sodiq, Oyewole Olumide, and Ikenna Amaechi.\n\nThe suspects, who were arraigned in July 2021, have pleaded not guilty to the five-count charge bordering on alleged murder, arson and theft.\n\nSpeaking to TheCable on the development, Adekemi said the suspects have remained in custody since they were arrested, while the case was not heard in court at the last sitting on September 27.\n\nAccording to her, she was told that the case has been transferred to another judge.\n\nSUNDAY OKORO\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Okoro, a commercial driver, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the vandalism of the Orile police station in Lagos.\n\nHe was said to have been spotted in the background of a picture depicting hoodlums destroying the police station.\n\nFestus Ogun, counsel representing Okoro, told TheCable that after a series of court appearances, the driver was granted bail.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Okoro\u2019s wife has not been able to meet the bail conditions which include three sureties with tax clearance in the past three years. The driver is also said to be the breadwinner of the family.\n\nThe suspect is still in Kirikiri prison \u2014 10 months after his arrest \u2014 and the next court sitting on the case is December 8.",

          "title": "THE AFTERMATH: Abuja-Kaduna not safe by road or rail -- so what next?",
          "text": "On Thursday, news broke of an attack on a train along the Abuja-Kaduna rail track. Suspected bandits damaged a section of the track and shattered the window of the driver\u2019s compartment on the train.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe incident, said to have occurred around 8pm on Wednesday, involved a train which took off from the Idu station at 6pm and was en route to Kaduna.\n\nFear gripped passengers after a loud bang \u2014 suspected to be caused by an explosive device \u2014 led to the shutdown of the train\u2019s engine. The train\u2019s lights and air conditioning system were shut off, while passengers were stranded for more than three hours.\n\nAnother train eventually reached the passengers at about 12am which conveyed them to the station at Rigasa in Kaduna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA similar incident was said to have played out the next day and Shehu Sani, a former senator representing Kaduna central, said it \u201ctook a miracle\u201d for them to escape.\n\n\u201cYesterday, terrorists attacked the Kaduna Abuja railway with an explosive & opened fire on the train, targeting the Engine Driver & the Tank,\u201d Sani had tweeted.\n\nFollowing the development, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) shut down services on the Abuja-Kaduna route.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRUSH FOR THE TRAINS\n\nThe obvious commute between the nation\u2019s capital and Kaduna, a north-western state, is by road. That was the popular means until the Abuja-Kaduna train project was completed shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari assumed power in 2015 \u2014 the project was started by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe rail service did not record a huge number of passengers when it initially started, but it began recording a surge from about late 2017. With repeated abductions on the Abuja-Kaduna highway and millions of naira paid as ransom, it was not unexpected that more people would turn to rail transport.\n\nIn 2019, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, said the daily passenger traffic on the Abuja-Kaduna rail line had tripled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe actual number of passengers that the service can take for the sitting capacity is about 1,000 plus, but we are carrying 3,700 people daily. The reason we allowed standing on the Abuja-Kaduna train is the insecurity that has made it unbearable to insist on sitting,\u201d he had said.\n\nWITH ROAD AND RAIL UNSAFE, WHAT NEXT?\n\nThe UK government\u2019s travel advice lists the Abuja-Kaduna highway as \u201cparticularly prevalent\u201d for criminal activities. The US also lists Kaduna as a high risk area due to kidnapping.\n\nDespite repeated directives by the president on adopting a \u201ccrushing response\u201d against bandits and security deployment to the area, the attacks on the highway have continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith hundreds of persons kidnapped on the highway over the past months \u2014 including the very recent abduction of the Emir of Bungudu \u2014 while a wealthy few may turn to private aircraft to commute between Kaduna and the FCT since it is not a commercial route, there are speculations on if airlines will see a change in their operations to include Abuja-Kaduna flights.\n\nMeanwhile, Aero Contractors, on Friday, denied reports that it was offering a N14,000 promo for passengers interested in travelling from Abuja to Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to inform the entire public that Aero had earlier suspended operations on that route. We urge our customers to ignore such rumours,\u201d Abdullahi Mahmood, chief executive officer of the airline, said in a statement.\n\nWith commercial flights unavailable \u2014 and inaccessible to many who may be unable to afford the fares \u2014 residents say there is a need for urgent security intervention in the area, especially for travellers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018WE\u2019RE IN BIG TROUBLE\u2019\n\nSunday Oibe, a community leader in Kaduna, expressed concern over the security situation and called on the federal government to improve on efforts to ensure safety.\n\n\u201cNigerians are in serious dilemma because the Abuja-Kaduna road is a gateway to the north-west. There should be massive security deployment to flush out the bandits,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to be really careful, because if these criminals can bomb rail track, we are in for big trouble. No, we cannot travel freely from Kaduna to Abuja anymore.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies have to double their efforts to secure the road. The question is why it has been difficult to flush out these people on that axis. The federal government must do everything to secure that road and indeed highways across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the security situation and how it will affect passengers, Nasir Danbatta, a journalist in Kaduna, said government needs to be more focused.\n\n\u201cThis is the consequence of not taking action at the appropriate time. Government and security agencies may be doing their best, but it seems they were lax in ensuring that the Kaduna-Abuja road is safe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile the train was operating, they were expected to do well by making the road safer. They relied heavily on making the train as an alternative means of travelling and did nothing about the security and safety on the road.\n\n\u201cBesides insecurity, the road is dilapidated. The criminals terrorising the road were not dealt with efficiently at the appropriate time. The negligence of the challenge on the road also gave criminals the opportunity to regroup and try to attack the train.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, you can\u2019t travel to Abuja. The government must take drastic action to address the situation.\u201d\n\nSection 14(2)(b) of the 1999 constitution (as amended) provides that \u201cthe security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government, and the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this constitution\u201d.\n\nAlthough repairs have concluded on the damaged tracks, and the NRC has announced that Abuja-Kaduna train services will resume on Saturday, the use of rail transport still appears like an escape from the reality of the security challenges along the Abuja-Kaduna highway.\n\nWith the train attack \u2014 which appears to be a new dimension considering the reported use of explosives \u2014 the government has more to do to ensure safety of travellers.\n\nThe national assembly has asked the president to declare bandits or kidnappers as terrorists, so they can be dealt with accordingly. But while many wonder if changing the nomenclature will improve security, it remains the government\u2019s duty \u2014 as provided for in the constitution \u2014 to keep its citizens safe.",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I spoke with Charles Isidi \u2014 a growth marketing expert and digital media and marketing communications professional \u2014 over the phone, both of us stuttering to varying degrees as we discussed stuttering, words from a 2001 R&B song came back to me.\n\nWithout bogging you down with details, the chorus goes, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying, because when you\u2019re replying, stutter, stutters, stutter, stutters.\u201d\n\nLovers of R&B know that in the rest of the song, Joseph Lewis Thomas, known mononymously as Joe, suspected his partner was cheating on him. Yes, he smelt cologne. Yes, she didn\u2019t pick up when he called. But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs. On Thursday, October 21, 2021, AltSchool was launched.\n\nWhat is AltSchool? It is a 9-month mentorship and upskilling program to train entry-level developers.

Small and medium enterprises in Nigeria, however, need even more applause.\n\nIn a country where everything from infrastructure to capital is a struggle, it takes a lot of grit, unusual strength, and patience to run a business.\n\nEnter BIZ301. With two decades of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) experience, Toyin Akintayo acutely understands this struggle. And with the help of his team, he decided to build BIZ301 to help entrepreneurs digitise small businesses operations.\n\nThink of a platform that manages expenses and budgets, invoices, employee and payroll management, helpdesk, and facility management applications. For as low as \u20a61000 a month, users can access all this on BIZ301.\n\nCurious?

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different. Per TechCrunch, Akindolu shares that the company\u2019s focus is financial operations and cash flow support for SMEs.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nTechpoint Awards 2021: Nominate your favourite startups, influencers, and investors.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has warned Nigerian telecom users of Flubot, a new, high-risk and extremely-damaging, malware that targets bank accounts\n\nNCC in a press statement signed by its spokesperson, Ikechukwu Adinde, said the Nigeria Computer Emergency Response Team, ngCERT affirmed that Flubot \u201cimpersonates Android mobile banking applications to draw fake web view on targeted applications\u201d and its goal transcends stealing personal data and essentially targets stealing of credit card details or online banking credentials.\n\nNCC said, \u201cAccording to the information received today, October 21, 2021, from the Nigeria Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT), Flubot targets Androids with fake security updates and App installations.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlubot is circulated through Short Message Service (SMS) and can snoop on incoming notifications, initiate calls, read or write SMSes, and transmit the victim\u2019s contact list to its control centre,\u201d it added\n\nNCC said the malware attacks Android devices by pretending to be \u201cFedEx, DHL, Correos, and Chrome applications\u201d and compels unsuspecting users to alter the accessibility configurations on their devices in order to maintain a continuous presence on devices.\n\nMalware is a generic word used to describe a virus or software, designed specially to \u201cdisrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the new malware undermines the security of devices by copying fake login screens of prominent banks, and the moment the users enter their login details on the fake pages, their data is harvested and transmitted to the malware operators\u2019 control point from where the data is exploited by intercepting banking-related One Time Passwords (OTPs) and replacing the default SMS app on the targeted Android device.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsequently, it secures admittance into the device through SMS and proceeds to transmit similar messages to other contacts that may be on the device it has attacked enticing them into downloading the fake app,\u201d NCC added\n\nThe Commission further explained that when Flubot infects a device, it can result in incalculable financial losses. Additionally, the malware creates a backdoor which grants access to the user\u2019s device, thus enabling the invader or attacker to perform other criminal actions, including launching other variants of malware.\n\nIn view of this discovery and understanding of the process by which this malware operates, and in order to protect millions of telecom consumers and prevent criminal forces, irrespective of location, from using telecom platforms to perpetrate fraud and irredeemable damages, the NCC reiterate the advisory of ngCERT which includes:\n\n\u201cDo not click on the link if you receive a suspicious text message, and do not install any app or security update the page asks you to install, Use updated antivirus software that detects and prevents malware infections, Apply critical patches to the system and application, Use strong passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) over logins, Back-up your data regularly, If you have been affected by this campaign, you should reset your device to factory mode as soon as possible. This will delete any data on your phone, including personal data,\n\nOther measures given by the commission are: \u201d Do not restore from backups created after installing the app.\n\nYou may contact ngCERT on incident@cert.gov.ng for technical assistance, You will also need to change the passwords to all of your online accounts, with urgency, around your online bank accounts, If you have concerns that your accounts may have been accessed by unauthorised people, contact your bank immediately.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Friday, charged the judiciary to speed up the process of justice delivery on cases of sexual and gender-based violence, noting that the conviction of more offenders will serve as a deterrent to others who might have the intention of committing the same crimes.\n\nObaseki gave the charge at a one-day sensitization and capacity building workshop on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) for High Court Judges and judicial officers in Edo State, held in Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor us in Edo, we consider gender-based violence as serious, which is why from the onset of our government we made a commitment to protecting the rights of vulnerable persons in our state.\n\n\u201cWe saw a tremendous increase in gender-based violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has prompted us to increase our actions in tackling the issue of abuses.\u201d\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe gruesome murder of Uwaila Omozuwa was a wake-up call for us. As a government, we couldn\u2019t just sit and allow our society to accept such conduct. It is our collective responsibility to drive the desired changes that are required to ensure that we have a society that is free of violence, particularly gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary is a very critical arm of government; you must play a very active role in addressing these challenges. We must get a lot more convictions because it\u2019s only convictions that serve as a deterrent to the abuse of persons.\n\n\u201cWe have worked with our lawmakers to update our statues to meet our present-day challenges, and are very much aware and understand the tasks ahead in establishing synergy and ensuring policy consistency across our three arms of government, as part of the efforts that we must understand to rein in offenders.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to protecting the girl-child in the state, the governor stated, \u201cIn Edo, our commitment to address gender-based violence or violence against persons has been demonstrated as we are one of the first states in Nigeria to sign the Violence Against Persons (VAP) Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe have launched a sexual offenders\u2019 register which serves as a tool to shame all those persons who have been convicted in gender-based violence. We have linked our register with that of the national register. We are driven by the need to ensure that those who perpetrate gender-based violence are apprehended and made to face justice strictly.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cIt is important to note that Edo has established the Sexual Assault Referral Centre which is named after a girl, Vivian Ogu, whose life was cut short by criminals who tried to rape her, years ago. Addressing the menace of sexual-based violence has to be holistic and thorough.\n\n\u201cYou are all gathered here today because we want you to take charge of this mandate. We are lucky in Edo because the majority of our judges are women, so we do not have to preach to the converted.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the wife of Edo Governor, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, who is the Chairperson of the Edo State Gender-Based Violence Management Committee, reiterated the need for more convictions in support of the government\u2019s fight against gender-based violence in the state.\n\nShe noted, \u201cLet us all be committed and take all we have learned from the workshop seriously and put them into practice, and taking our work to the international high level. At the end of the day, we want to see more convictions.\n\n\u201cThe governor has assured us of providing requisites; we need to build new courthouses and a special courthouse for gender-based violence, with special judges assigned to these courts.\u201d\n\nIn her welcome remarks, Ms. Comfort Lamptey, United Nations (UN) Women Representative to Nigeria and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who spoke via zoom, described the judiciary as crucial in ensuring access to justice for women and girls.\n\nLamptey further applauded the state government\u2019s commitment to ensuring access to justice for all, especially for women and girls in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe erstwhile National Secretary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, Professor Wale Oladiipo has said he received with shock, the news that he had not been cleared to contest for the position of Deputy National Chairman (south) by the Screening Committee of the party, blaming same on what he described as observable shenanigans by some \u201cinterested powers\u201d that were afraid of his electoral value at the National Convention.\n\nOladipo said the powerful forces caused a frivolous petition to be written and submitted concerning his activities during the unfortunate crisis that engulfed the party more than five years ago.\n\nAccording to him, the content of the hatchet job remains hazy but the little the people know purportedly hinges on the past crisis that the party passed through then.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is funny and extremely absurd that three petitions can be written by the same person, using the same address and same word processing machine on three different aspirants from Osun, Ondo and Anambra States!!! What a tragic comedy! The petition was not made available to me before decision was taken.\n\n\u201d However, throughout the duration of the avoidable crises, l served our party with dignity and kept my mind fixated on how the party will progress therefrom.\n\n\u201cWhen the final decision was made, l abided by it and stayed by the party which consequently made us deliver on our mandate.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, it is expediently necessary to reiterate the following facts in sequence order to refresh your memory regarding my activities this far thus:\n\n(1) That when l was the National Secretary, l was never found wanting, but rather performed my duties without blemish up to the point of my exit.\n\n(2) That l have thereafter been performing my roles in terms of responsibilities and privileges.\n\nI have diligently been discharging my responsibilities as a member of NEC of our great party and BoT. I am also a proud member of both the Convention Committee and the PDP e-registration Committee.\n\n(3) That l am also pleased to say that l have been delivering my constituencies constantly to the party.\n\nI have never decamped to any other party or sabotage the interests of the party in any form.\n\n(4) That l have never left the party.\n\nIt is therefore funny that those who walked out of convention when we had a sitting President are cleared to contest. To me, this is most abnormal and unfair\u201d\n\n\u201d Even then, every power is temporary.bThose who have power today should be conscious of the fact that some people had it yesterday while some other people will still have that power tomorrow. Power is transient like the effervescence of soda.\n\n\u201cHaving the conviction that there will always be a tomorrow, l am not going to bother myself to push this case further beyond this point because l believe in our own course which is first and foremost, to deliver Osun State to PDP and from there to move on as a committed party faithful.\n\n\u201cThough I have a right of appeal, and to seek redress within the confines of the internal mechanism of the party\u2019s constitution, but l am not a desperate politician to go that route since the \u201cpower that be today\u201d have apparently decided of what to achieve at the convention, l have no choice than to move on to concentrate on delivering Osun State to PDP in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have delivered in the past and we shall continue to deliver. By the special grace of God, after delivering Osun State to PDP, we will be back stronger and higher\u201d\n\nThe member of Board of Trustee of PDP urged the people to be cool and calm and not be discouraged or distracted from the task of delivering Osun for PDP in all our future elections beginning from the 2022 governorship election.",

          "text": "A former deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, on Saturday, condemned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and his allegations of terrorist activities against Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho).\n\nAccording to Frank in a statement in Abuja, Malami\u2019s allegations were not only spurious, but highly selective and high-wired propaganda aimed at securing selfish political gains.\n\nHe wondered why Malami as the chief law officer of the Federation choose to organise what he called a \u201ccontemptuous press conference\u201d to discuss matters that were already being heard by courts of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria and Benin Republic.\n\nHe said that Malami was only out to whitewash the Federal Government\u2019s illegal, ethnically-biased and nepotistic clampdown on and trial of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Kanu, and the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho.\n\nHe noted that such impunity against citizens by the present administration is the very reason why several zones of the country are clamouring to exit the Nigerian union.\n\nFrank, who is the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, said while the Federal Government is up in arms against Kanu and Igboho over alleged terrorist activities, it has failed and equally neglected to arrest and prosecute Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and their sponsors operating in the North.\n\nHe lamented that over a month after the Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) handed over the names of six Nigerian financiers of terrorism to the Federal Government, they have refused to investigate, arrest and prosecute them because of their religious affiliations and the section of the country they come from.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, according to him, those named by the UAE as alleged financiers of terrorism from Nigeria are: Abdurrahaman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nHe insisted that neither Malami nor any Nigerian security agency has briefed the press or reported any form of investigation, arrest or prosecution of those on the above list by the Federal Government.\n\nFrank said: \u201cIs it not laughable that Malami has blamed Igboho for financing terrorism in the North and Kanu for the hijack of the #EndSARS protests and attendant mayhem unleashed in Lagos last year?\u201d\n\nHe described the recent arraignment of Nnamdi Kanu at the Federal High Court, Abuja, when lawyers, media and prominent Nigerians were denied access to the court which consequently intimidated the Judge and where the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) assumed the role of complainant, prosecutor and judge in their own case as a charade and show of shame on the part of the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMalami told reporters at the press conference that Nnamdi Kanu is being prosecuted for his statements that led to killings and destruction of property both in the South East and in Lagos but when Buhari incited killings and destruction of property in the North through his \u201cdog and baboon will be soaked in blood\u2026\u201d statement in 2012, in reference to the 2015 general elections, who prosecuted him?\u201d\n\nHe challenged Buhari and Malami to name members of the National Assembly they have accused of sponsoring Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho to prove the veracity of their claims just like the Government of the UAE has made public the names of those financing terrorism in their country, Nigeria and others.\n\nHe called on Malami in particular and the Major General Muhammdu Buhari-led administration in general, to stop spreading hatred, causing division and attempting to instigate and provoke mutual distrust and animosity between the South West and the South East through lies and disinformation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe called on the international community to take cognizance of the lip service being paid to the fight against terrorism in Nigeria by the Federation Government and the witch-hunt it has continued to unleash on members of the opposition political parties and individuals with dissenting opinion from the Southern part of the country like Kanu and Igboho.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to dismiss Malami\u2019s half-truths against Kanu and Igboho and to continue to demand for fairness, justice and equity as bonafide citizens.\n\nHe also called Nigerian leaders in the South to speak out and condemn Malami\u2019s statement as they are capable of inciting violence in the country.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the international community to disregard the pre-arranged outcome from the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho due to the obviously unfair and hushed trial being conducted against them by the Federal Government.",

          "text": "A former deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, on Saturday, condemned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and his allegations of terrorist activities against Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho).\n\nAccording to Frank in a statement in Abuja, Malami\u2019s allegations were not only spurious, but highly selective and high-wired propaganda aimed at securing selfish political gains.\n\nHe wondered why Malami as the chief law officer of the Federation choose to organise what he called a \u201ccontemptuous press conference\u201d to discuss matters that were already being heard by courts of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria and Benin Republic.\n\nHe said that Malami was only out to whitewash the Federal Government\u2019s illegal, ethnically-biased and nepotistic clampdown on and trial of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Kanu, and the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho.\n\nHe noted that such impunity against citizens by the present administration is the very reason why several zones of the country are clamouring to exit the Nigerian union.\n\nFrank, who is the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, said while the Federal Government is up in arms against Kanu and Igboho over alleged terrorist activities, it has failed and equally neglected to arrest and prosecute Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and their sponsors operating in the North.\n\nHe lamented that over a month after the Government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) handed over the names of six Nigerian financiers of terrorism to the Federal Government, they have refused to investigate, arrest and prosecute them because of their religious affiliations and the section of the country they come from.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, according to him, those named by the UAE as alleged financiers of terrorism from Nigeria are: Abdurrahaman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nHe insisted that neither Malami nor any Nigerian security agency has briefed the press or reported any form of investigation, arrest or prosecution of those on the above list by the Federal Government.\n\nFrank said: \u201cIs it not laughable that Malami has blamed Igboho for financing terrorism in the North and Kanu for the hijack of the #EndSARS protests and attendant mayhem unleashed in Lagos last year?\u201d\n\nHe described the recent arraignment of Nnamdi Kanu at the Federal High Court, Abuja, when lawyers, media and prominent Nigerians were denied access to the court which consequently intimidated the Judge and where the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) assumed the role of complainant, prosecutor and judge in their own case as a charade and show of shame on the part of the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMalami told reporters at the press conference that Nnamdi Kanu is being prosecuted for his statements that led to killings and destruction of property both in the South East and in Lagos but when Buhari incited killings and destruction of property in the North through his \u201cdog and baboon will be soaked in blood\u2026\u201d statement in 2012, in reference to the 2015 general elections, who prosecuted him?\u201d\n\nHe challenged Buhari and Malami to name members of the National Assembly they have accused of sponsoring Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho to prove the veracity of their claims just like the Government of the UAE has made public the names of those financing terrorism in their country, Nigeria and others.\n\nHe called on Malami in particular and the Major General Muhammdu Buhari-led administration in general, to stop spreading hatred, causing division and attempting to instigate and provoke mutual distrust and animosity between the South West and the South East through lies and disinformation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe called on the international community to take cognizance of the lip service being paid to the fight against terrorism in Nigeria by the Federation Government and the witch-hunt it has continued to unleash on members of the opposition political parties and individuals with dissenting opinion from the Southern part of the country like Kanu and Igboho.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to dismiss Malami\u2019s half-truths against Kanu and Igboho and to continue to demand for fairness, justice and equity as bonafide citizens.\n\nHe also called Nigerian leaders in the South to speak out and condemn Malami\u2019s statement as they are capable of inciting violence in the country.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the international community to disregard the pre-arranged outcome from the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho due to the obviously unfair and hushed trial being conducted against them by the Federal Government.",

          "text": "The national president of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association (IPMAN), Engr. Sanusi Fari, has allayed fears of members over the scrapping of the Petroleum Equalisation Fund by the federal government.\n\nIt was widely reported on Wednesday that the federal government had officially scrapped the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) and the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF).\n\nPEF is the special intervention fund put in place by the federal government with the mandate to ensure price uniformity of petroleum products across the country, through the reimbursement of marketers for losses they incur in trucking products from depots to their filling stations anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nThe action of the federal government is premised on the passage and implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) passed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari after both chambers of the National Assembly had passed, clause by clause, the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nTwo new agencies, the Upstream Regulatory Commission and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) have since been saddled statutorily to perform the duties of the three defunct agencies.\n\nLEADERSHHIP Weekend findings revealed that the leadership of the defunct agencies are now technically handing over to their successors put in place by the minister of state for petroleum, Timipre Sylva, at the Wednesday inauguration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo this effect, IPMAN president, Fari, in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja said there was no truth in the claim by certain downstream oil sector industry operators that with the scrapping of PEF, the outstanding bridging claims owed marketers would not be paid.\n\nWhile urging his members not to panic, Fari maintained that the association had what it takes based on its close working relationship with the leadership of National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) and the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas (NUPENG) to ensure that payment of marketers bridging claims owed by PEF was not lost.\n\n\u201cFollowing the scrapping of the three federal government agencies, I wish to inform our teeming members nationwide that there should not be any apprehension over the fate of our businesses most especially, the marketers\u2019 funds still being held by the PEF,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe PIA provides for the establishment of Upstream Regulatory Commission (UPR) and Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority (MDRA) which the Hon. Minister of State had announced their respective CEOs as Mr. Gbenga Komolafe and Mr. Farouk Ahmed. We congratulate them and wish them success.\n\n\u201cTherefore, DPR, PEF and PPPRA have been collapsed into these two newly established agencies to still cater for the needs of our members.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of IPMAN, I call on our members not to panic. Kindly continue to serve the general public in the interest of our country,\u201d he said.",

Abas Tajudeen, the Director-General of the agency, Dr. Omale Joseph explained that not less than 15 percent of every 1,000 women die due to blood loss during childbirth and urged Nigerians to imbibe the practice of donating blood.\n\n\u201cAs you donate blood, you\u2019re saving a life, and not only that, research has shown that people who donate blood regularly live more healthy\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAccording to the DG, the Commission was putting the mechanism in place to check sharp practices by hospitals in the use of blood for patients, adding that through its One Million Safe Blood Initiative, it was expected that safe blood will be accessible for Nigerians in the six geopolitical zones of the country at any point in time.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the Commission which had the three core mandates of \u201cregulation, coordination and ensuring the provision of safe blood to the people\u201d, gave the assurance that plans were already in top gear to ensure that wastage of stored blood is halted through the use of expired blood for the production of usable components, noting that safe blood had a viable lifespan of between 30 and 35 days.\n\nFielding question on how Nigerians could be encouraged to have their blood groups handy to help in cases of emergency, the DG disclosed that for a start, the Commission was already collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) , to ensure that drivers\u2019 licenses are issued with the holder\u2019s blood IDs.\n\nEarlier Hon. Tajudeen had described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Bill as \u201ca very important milestone achieved in the health sector\u201d, as according to him, blood transfusion before now had been largely unregulated, with a lot of sharp practices involved.\n\nThe lawmaker said available statistics have shown that over 40 percent of voluntarily donated blood was unsafe for use, with the majority of donors doing so for monetary gains, adding that in some cases, recipients ended up being infected with diseases, but that with the Commission in place, a lot of such issues will be addressed.\n\nIt would be recalled the Commission\u2019s establishment Bill, which was introduced by Hon. Abas Tajudeen in the House of Representatives was passed in March 2021, got Senate\u2019s concurrence in June, and was subsequently signed into law by President Buhari.",

Two traditional rulers were killed in that attack.\n\nHe added that Kanu also played a role in the violence recorded during the EndSARS protests in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities,\u201d Malami said.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down Police stations, Correctional centres, INEC offices, bus terminals, the Palace of Oba of Lagos, Banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\u201d\n\nMalami stated that during the attacks, 19 offices, 18 logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets belonging to INEC were destroyed in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi, and Imo States.\n\nHe added that 164 police stations and formations, including the Police Headquarters in Owerri, Imo State, were attacked by IPOB/ESN members.\n\nMalami told journalists at the briefing that a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee, comprising twenty-four members, which he heads found links between Kanu and the attacks during its investigations into his activities.\n\nRead the full text of the AGF\u2019s briefing below:",

The court, which on Sept. 1 allowed the law to go into effect, declined to act on the Justice Department\u2019s request to immediately block enforcement of the measure.\n\nThe court will consider whether the law\u2019s unusual private-enforcement structure prevents federal courts from intervening to strike it down and whether the federal government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it.\n\nThe measure bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.\n\nLiberal Justice Sotomayor dissented from the court\u2019s deferral of a decision on whether to block enforcement of the law while the litigation continues. Sotomayor said the law\u2019s novel design has suspended nearly all abortions in Texas, the second most populous U.S. state, with about 29 million people.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s gambit has worked. The impact is catastrophic,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.",

          "text": "As a film crew and actors in Western garb prepared to rehearse a scene inside a wooden, chapel-like building on a desert movie ranch outside Santa Fe, assistant director Dave Halls stepped outside and grabbed a prop gun off a cart.\n\nHe walked back in and handed it to the film\u2019s star, Alec Baldwin, assuring him it was safe to use because it didn\u2019t have live ammo.\n\n\u201cCold gun,\u201d Halls yelled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, according to court records made public Friday. Instead, when Baldwin pulled the trigger Thursday, he killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her.\n\nThe tragedy came nearly three decades after Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died in a similar case, and it prompted horrified questions about how it could have happened again.\n\nThe executive producer of ABC\u2019s police drama \u201cThe Rookie\u201d announced Friday the show would no longer use \u201clive\u201d weapons because the \u201csafety of our cast and crew is too important.\u201d\n\nDetails of the shooting at the ranch on Bonanza Creek Road were included in a search warrant application filed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Investigators were seeking to examine Baldwin\u2019s blood-stained costume for the film \u201cRust,\u201d as well as the weapon that was fired, other prop guns and ammunition, and any footage that might exist.\n\nThe gun was one of three that the film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being acted, according to the records. Halls grabbed the gun from the cart and brought it inside to Baldwin, unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in the search warrant application.\n\nAP",
