I felt okay from the beginning, maybe because one had received all three jabs, and right now, I feel 100 per cent.

Thanks for your goodwill.\u201d\n\nTesting had recently been ramp up in the presidential villa in the wake of the Omicron variant to ensure the containment of the virus.\n\nRecall that the First Lady, Dr. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari had few days ago after returning from Istanbul, Turkey, ordered for the closure of her office and directed her staff to proceed on indefinite leave.\n\nIt is believed that the directive is not unconnected with the need to check the possible spread of coronavirus around the first family.\n\nShe had given a similar directive in the past as Covid-19 started to gain ground in the country.\n\nWhen Shehu was reached over the report Saturday, he said: \u201cHave you read the Premium Times report?

JAC\u2019S grouse is that of the N22.12bn released for the allowances, ASUU was allegedly given 75 per cent, while other unions of NASU and SSANU got only 25 per cent. Theirs is a call for equity.\n\nThe series of ASUU strikes over the failure of the Federal Government to fulfill its part of the Memoranda of Understanding (and Action) dates back to more than ten years across three regimes.\n\nThe last strike, which was called in March 2020 lasted for nine months and was called off when the Federal Government agreed to allow ASUU members receive their salaries through their home-grown University Transparency and Accountability Solution, UTAS, software instead of the Federal Government\u2019s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, IPPIS.\n\nASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, while announcing the latest ultimatum, said government has again failed to honour the agreement it signed.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, has, however, assured Nigerians that \u201cthe strike will not happen, funds are available\u201d.\n\nApart from the call for payment of the earned allowances of its members, ASUU is holding government to its agreement to release agreed funds for the physical revitalisation of our tertiary institutions.\n\nOur question for Ngige is: if the funds are indeed available, why delay the deployment of it? Why do the Federal and state governments relegate the importance of social services like education and health which are government\u2019s direct obligations to the people, especially the common people?\n\nWhy has the Federal Government allowed the acrimony between ASUU and NASU/SSANU to fester? Can\u2019t we copy what other more advanced countries are doing to maintain industrial harmony among all labour interest groups in our tertiary institutions?\n\nThe inability or unwillingness of the Federal Government to fulfil its signed MOUs must stop. Any serious and people-oriented government that gives education its pride of place will end strikes in the educational sector.\n\nThese public institutions are the avenues through which children of the masses acquire the capacity to escape illiteracy, poverty and destitution. It is wicked and unacceptable to tolerate the instability that the frequent strikes impose on our universities.\n\nThe ASUU, NASU and SSANU strikes must be nipped in the bud.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We want peace in our State. We want peace in the world, in our homes, we want peace in our relationship.

          "title": "20% pay rise: Police officers unhappy, indifferent",
          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nWhen President Muhammadu Buhari announced the approval of 20 per cent salary increase for officers and men of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) on December 15, there was jubilation and mixed reactions not just among the officers, but also the general public.\n\nThe president had through the Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, told state house correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting that the review exercise which would to take effect from January 2022, was in response to the demands made by EndSARS protesters in 2020, primarily on the improvement of welfare for police officers.\n\nHe said that the take-home pay would be enhanced through the duty tour allowance to six per cent of their new take-home pay and an approval of N1.12 billion for payment of outstanding uninsured benefits for the period of 2013 to 2020.\n\nHowever, while many saw the increase as a morale booster for the police to effectively carry out their duties, others feel the salary rise would not make any difference in the rot that has engulfed the force.\n\nFor the records, the last time the police had a review of salary was during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and since then nothing has been done as far as salary is concerned.\n\nBefore the increase by President Buhari, a police constable earned about N40,000, meaning that with the increase, a police Constable would be going home with about N50,000.\n\nBut while the increment should have been a thing of joy to the rank and file, many are not happy since the increase was not included in the 2022 budget and, therefore, see it as a scam.\n\nSome police officers who spoke to Sunday Sun have mixed feelings about the increase, saying that the problem in the force was more than salary increase.\n\nSome of the officers who do not want their names mentioned in print for fear of being victimized said that though the salary increase was good, there were more pressing needs in the police especially in the areas of logistics, welfare, and others.\n\nMore than the salary increase, many police officers said that they would prefer that government provide them with good healthcare facility, scholarship for their children, good and affordable accommodation, transport system, among other goodies to make their job comfortable.\n\nAn Inspector of police who spoke to Sunday Sun said: \u201cI heard the president has increased our salary by 20 per cent. Of what use is the increase when it is not included in the 2022 budget? I don\u2019t want to believe in this increase of a thing because if you take a very good look at it, it is not different with our old salary.\n\n\u201cThey said they are increasing salary and yet things in the country keep going from bad to worse. Food stuffs are very expensive to the extent that we can no longer afford three square meals for our families.\n\n\u201cTransport fares have skyrocketed, school fees are no go area not to talk of medicals even in our police hospitals.\u201d\n\nAnother personnel, a sergeant, told Sunday Sun that \u201cwe know it is not good to collect bribe from people, but I tell you sometimes we do that because of pressing circumstances.\n\n\u201cImagine you leaving home without giving your wife money to buy food for the family because you sincerely do not have any money and these are some of the things that push one to go into some kind of illegal acts and duties.\u201d\n\nOn how they have been coping with poor salary structure in the service and how it affects their duties and relationship with EndSARS protest, another policeman who craved for anonymity said: \u201cThe #EndSARS protest was a real eye opener to us as policemen. The protest opened our eyes to see that the people can be very powerful if they come together to achieve a just cause.\n\n\u201cThough we did not like the killings of policemen during the protest, it was very clear to us as police personnel that the people were fighting for our good. They saw the rot, the cheating going on in the service and decided to help us, but unfortunately the whole thing went bad and they started to kill and the killings have not stopped till this moment.\n\n\u201cThe lesson I learnt from the whole saga is that there is a limit you can push a person to the wall and you will see the other side of the person and the protest has taught me to be civil in my dealing with people no matter their status.\u201d\n\nFor Inusa Kura, before the #EndSARS protest, most police officers lobby to be posted to the Southeast to work.\n\nBut since after the protest and the current killings af policemen and burning down of police stations in the zone, nobody wants to serve in that region again.\n\nAccording him, \u201cI will say the EndSARS protest has a good and bad effect on policemen especially because of the killings. Before now, a policeman would lobby his way to get posted to the Southeast region of the country because of what we make there, but since after the process, a policeman would call out to cancel his posting to the Southeast, including consulting his village oracle. All these came about as a result of the EndSARS protest\u201d.\n\nFor a retired commissioner of police (names withheld): \u201cIt is not the salary per se that would determine the good conduct of police officers. They have to go back to the drawing board to see how they can think of a holistic welfare package for them. Talking about post retirement housing projects, scholarship scheme for their children, resuscitation of dry ration for patrol teams. A situation where policemen on legal patrol are made to fuel patrol vehicles is not accepted. Buy petrol for patrol vehicles, remove them from the road blocks so that they don\u2019t start seeing all those hardship that they are facing. These are the only things that can stop the #ENDSARS protest.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe easiest place for you to have confrontation with the police is usually at road blocks, except you look for their trouble and go to their police station and they start harassing you. Apart from that, the main platform where they get involved in all those misconducts is road block. So get all those road blocks off, buy more vehicles for them to patrol the highways so that the level of stress within those period of work would be minimize drastically.\n\n\u201cThere is a tipping point for every human being to get fatigued. People are always smarter when their stress level is low, when they have rested, but by the time they pass that level, they become irritated, they become aggressive and any little thing would just trigger them. So those are the areas where I think the government should concentrate on.\n\n\u201cSalary is okay, but if you make a comparative study for salaries around sub-Saharan Africa, you will find out that Nigeria is the lowest. But those things can also be mitigated by putting in place policies that if they don\u2019t adhere to it, they know they are going to lose out.\n\n\u201cFor instance, scholarship for their children, or if they die, there would be scholarship for their children that they left behind. For instance, how many constables get married to highly educated women like journalists, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other professionals? How many. They always marry people at their own class, their own level because of their poor salary of N40,000 and it means that if anything happens to them, it becomes another morale danger. Their allowances would not come on time, all those are the issues. But once you put into place sanctions and make it clear that they would not be able to access these welfare packages if they go against the rule, they will sit up and stop their irresponsible act.\n\n\u201cSo they must put in place those things that would act as a sanction against bad conduct. That is the only thing that can deter any man from violating such rules. For instance, if you know that your organization is paying the school fees of your children, why would you violate set down rules like bribe taking and getting dismissed from service. I tell you no sane man would do that if he truly loves his children.\n\n\u201cAnother problem in the police force has to do with the orientation of the men. The orientation of the men is a major problem in the force. Salary is okay, but it does not holistically solve all the problems of the police.\n\n\u201cAgain, you cannot be talking about community policing and still having barracks. The barracks are poorly maintained, they are highly unkempt. The police barracks concept is that of the colonial masters where they keep the men and mobilize them at short notices in case of crisis.\n\n\u201cBut the times have changed. There is no where in the world where they have police barracks. They live with the people, their children attend the same school with the people, they go to the same shopping malls, that\u2019s why that way they are forging on and building that trust and breaking the gap.\n\n\u201cGo and look at our police barracks, they are not habitable for any human being. So let\u2019s see if there will be improvement with the salary increase.\u201d\n\nOn his part, a former Inspector General of police, Solomon Arase, wants the government to take another look at the healthcare delivery system in the police especially for the rank and file and their dependants; scholarship for their children, good housing accommodation, among other packages are things that would end up dousing all these negative attitudes.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe that we should look beyond the salaries, we should look at other areas too. It is well for the police to do all those menial jobs for the political elite, but when the chips are down, nobody cares. Look at the way they kill policemen, behead them and do all manner of things to their dead bodies and nobody has been arrested for those gruesome acts.\n\n\u201cScholarship for their children, good healthcare for the rank and file and their dependants if all these are in place and there are infractions , it means that the person automatically loses access to those facilities. I think these would serve as a good conduct. So good health care services for inspectors and rank and file, and review of the various police reforms from 1999 to date.\u201d\n\nAnother policeman, who simply gave his name as Mohammed when asked about the 20 per cent salary increase, told Sunday Sun that he was not aware of it, but that he heard his colleagues talking about it and doubted if it was true or not.\n\nThe police sergeant, who tried to find out from this reporter if the story was true or one of those social media rumors, said: \u201cI heard that the president increased our salary, but that it is not plenty, but I know it is one of those promises and tricks by politicians to confuse us because another election is coming.\n\n\u201cI say it is a truck because I also heard that they did not put the money inside next year\u2019s budget and that is intentional. They purposely removed it from the budget of next year so that they will put it in 2023 and that is an election year to confuse us to go and risk our lives for them to occupy big, big offices.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that my sister, whether they increase our salary or not, it will not change anything because as we speak you know how much they sell gas now?\u201d\n\nFor Dahiru Danjuma, the hardship faced by him and his colleagues since the present administration came to power is unbelievable. Apart from the hardship, he said the number of policemen that have been killed since this administration came to power has never happened in the history of the police.\n\nTo him, the 20 per cent increase is nothing to write home about and should not be something to use to praise the achievements of the Buhari\u2019s government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I heard that government increased our salary by 20 per cent, I laughed because if you look at it for those of us that our salary is less that N40,000, it means what they added is about N8,000. Is that something to be happy about? And another thing again is that we don\u2019t even know if this their increase is for everybody because since the day that I heard it on television nobody has told us anything because they don\u2019t have anything to tell us before they put themselves in trouble with policemen\u201d.\n\nAlso a police inspector who does not want to be mentioned on print said: \u201cI heard about the salary increase, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for everybody, maybe it is for inspectors and the rank and file. That is what I want to believe because after the announcement by our police minister, I have not heard anything again and that may be because they did not include it in the budget next year.\n\n\u201cBut the truth of the matter is that increasing our salary by 20 per cent, would cause more problem for us because of the harsh economic conditions in the country. I am from the North and grains are our major food because we use it as the people from the East use garri and it used to very cheap because it was sold for as cheap as N80 per mudu. But today a mudu of corn is selling for as high as N500, so tell me what good would the 20 per cent salary increase do to us if not problems.\u201d\n\nBut for Danlami Bukar, \u201cthe salary increase is a good thing by the Buhari\u2019s government and I want to thank him very well. If other presidents have been increasing the salaries of policemen, the rot that we have in our system today would have been reduced. But I want to beg the president to please include it in next year\u2019s budget so that we can smile like the politicians.\u201d",

God does not discriminate in his blessings. The Bible says that he causes the rain to fall and the sun to shine on the good and the evil alike. He makes sure that He blesses everyone. And on this special occasion, I believe that every Nigerian should receive this great blessing that God has for us,\u201d Osinbajo said, adding, \u201cI believe that we are entering into a season of God\u2019s great blessings of peace and prosperity and all shall be well with our country, in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nSimilarly sounding upbeat in his Christmas message, Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun urged Nigerians to remain prayerful as the current challenges facing the nation would soon be a thing of the past.\n\nGovernor Abiodun made the call at a church service held at the St. James\u2019 Anglican Church, Iperu-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area yesterday. Noting that the country\u2019s present challenges were surmountable, he said: \u201cGod has kept us alive despite the raging COVID-19 pandemic. We should continue to celebrate and be thankful despite our challenges. It will make us resolve to press forward in the coming year.\n\n\u201cPlease let us be prayerful; all hope is not lost. Yes, the country is going through challenges in the areas of kidnapping, banditry, terrorism and the likes. With God nothing shall be impossible,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nKebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has felicitated with Christians as they celebrate this year\u2019s Christmas and urged them the period to continue to live in peace with each other irrespective of their religious, political and ethnic differences.\n\nWith Christian faithful marking the birth of Jesus Christ, Kebbi State governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has called for peaceful coexistence, unity, and patriotism.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mallam Yahyah Sarki, Governor Bagudu said: \u201cWith unity, Nigeria will continue to grow from strength to strength. This means that the country would be at par with its contemporaries. Our diversity and population should be an advantage, more opportunities, and not problems. There is the need for the citizens to also exhibit more love and patriotism in favour of the nation.\u201d\n\nLeading aspirant in the contest for the governorship seat of Cross River State and senator representing Cross River Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Prof Sandy Onor, urged the people of the state to ignore individuals preaching the message of division under the guise of zoning politics. Instead, he advised \u201cthe people to follow the path of love, forgiveness and selflessness as they celebrate this year\u2019s Christmas, saying that love remained the foundation of everything good.\u201d\n\nOnor said there are strong indications that 2022 would be the best in the history of the state, as it would afford members of the various political parties the opportunity to choose the right person to fly their party\u2019s flag for the 2023 election.\n\nHe said: \u201cGod has been very faithful to us as a people during the outgoing year, despite the oddities some of us may have faced. I see a new day ahead of us as Cross Riverians. Events of the past and the failure of the present government in our state to put smiles on your faces may have dampened your spirit. But I implore you to forgive the system and the people at the helm of affairs and show love at all times, especially at this time of Christmas. Next year will be very critical for us a people. It is that year when you will have the opportunity, as member of a political party, to choose who the entire state will support, to take Cross River from the woods.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn taking this decision, I enjoin you to have the interest of our state at heart. This state has been messed up in the last six years. We cannot, therefore, afford to sacrifice competence, character, integrity and genuine love for our state on the altar of zoning brouhaha and ethnic jingoism.\u201d\n\nAbia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu while felicitating the people of the state and other Nigerians, urged them to celebrate the season with full understanding of its significance in the life of the average Christian.\n\n\u201cThe birth of Christ is about the most important event in Christianity, since it was the beginning of the redemption of mankind,\u201d the governor said, and assured the people of the state that his administration had taken critical steps to ensure that they were able to take part in the celebrations through the release of about N3.5bn to deal with the issue of salaries of some ailing parastatals and pensioners.\n\nIn her message, immediate past senator who represented Abia Central, Senator Nkechi Nwaogu prayed that the year would end on a cheerful note while thanking God for His kindness, protection, and guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has charged Nigerians to remain resilient. The leader of the caucus, Kingsley Chinda, in a statement, yesterday to mark the Christmas said in spite of the economic and security challenges in the country, the citizens must remain hopeful for a better Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u201cClearly, Christmas comes with bliss, fanfare and happy moments. But what bliss, fanfare and happy moments can we truly say Nigerians are having in the face of glaring hunger, economic hardship, rising cost/standard of living, kidnappings, killings and general insecurity across the country, occasioned by a clueless, inept and incompetent APC led Federal Government? This question clearly leaves us with the reality that as we mark this year\u2019s Christmas, we must remain positive and resilient in the face of these challenges and hope for a better and greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkwa Ibom State governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has reiterated that the the purpose of the yuletide, saying, \u201cThis is a season where we should banish all ancient animosities and celebrate our oneness and unity, our development and the strides we are collectively making as a state and as a people.\n\n\u201cIt is a season of joy and thankfulness to God for holding us together as a people and as a state, in spite of the economic difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, which unfortunately has now mutated to the Delta and Omicron variants respectively.\u201d\n\nIn his Christmas message, Chairman, Senate Committee on Drugs and Narcotics and senator representing Plateau Central Senatorial District, Sen. Hezekiah Ayuba Dimka Nigerians to emulate Christ and show love, pursue peace and exhibit selfless sacrifice.\n\nChairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Lagos State Chapter, Rt. Rev. Stephen Adegbite, called on Christians to celebrate Christmas by helping the less fortunate and also go for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAdegbite, yesterday in a statement that read in part, said: \u201cThe message of Christmas is a reminder that love is an essential ingredient and a key tool for peaceful communal coexistence and relationship with one another not minding creed, race, tribe, religious beliefs and other factors that are today promoting hatred, discord, disunity and self centeredness.\n\n\u201cIt is a principle of love your neighbour as yourself. In loving your neighbour, protecting yourself from being a potential spreader of the virus is a responsible thing to do. Do not hesitate or delay in going for the vaccination so that we can reduce and gradually eradicate the spread and keep our world safe.\u201d",

Let us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a special Christmas message personally signed and issued yesterday, promised to ensure that the security challenges facing Nigerians become history soon.\n\nFor years, terrorists have been roaming across the country unhindered, killing, kidnapping and maiming.\n\nWhile rejoicing with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Christmas, the President declared: \u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\u201d\n\nThe President admitted that despite the \u201cremarkable successes generally recorded,\u201d the nation still has challenges to contend with.\n\nHe noted that the military was doing everything possible to tackle the insecurity menace.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time. It is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\u201d\n\nThe President urged Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in them and see the present order of things as a phase that would also pass, \u201cjust like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe said his government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, adding that the diversification of the economy embarked upon by his government was yielding fruits.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWe shall continue to create opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy. As we felicitate with family, friends, colleagues, associates, let us spare moments to reach out to the less privileged.\n\n\u201cLet us also pray and give words of encouragement to our gallant security personnel fulfilling their oaths to keep us safe.\n\n\u201cI assure my compatriots that this administration remains resolute at ensuring that the standard of living of the average Nigerian is elevated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that his six and half-year administration would fulfill all the promises made to Nigerians before the government terminates in 17 months\u2019 time.\n\nUrges Citizens to Get Vaccinated\n\nAlso in the Christmas message, the President pleaded with all citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that for the second Christmas running, the world would not be able to celebrate as it used to in years past because of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant debilitating impact, has remained with mankind, mutating and leaving in its wake, devastating consequences on the economy, social interaction, and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic. Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.\n\n\u201cI will also urge those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC). I commend the efforts of members of the PSC under the headship of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as they continue to chart a roadmap out of the pandemic and associated issues.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I wish Nigerians Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nKaigama: Heart of Every Nigerian Heavy with Suffering\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd. Ignatius Kaigama yesterday lamented that the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with the suffering they had experienced and seen in 2021 alone.\n\nKaigama, who stated this in his Christmas message, also called on Nigerians not to give up on the country, saying although the present situations may be tough, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with security challenges, COVID-19 and agitations for self-determination, Nigerians would not forget 2021 in a hurry.\n\nThe cleric told the faithful not to give up on their country, but \u201cdare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKaigama said: \u201cChristmas this year has found us in the throes of woes and distressing circumstances far beyond our human control. As Nigerians, in almost every part of this country, our hearts are heavy with the suffering we have experienced and seen this year alone \u2013 the many deaths as a result of terrorism, kidnapping and banditry, the depressing economic situation with inflation spiraling out of control, crashing further the ordinary man who has already been drained of joy, peace, and hope.\n\n\u201cThe violent agitations for self-determination, which have come with the loss of lives and limbs, have left horrific scars on our collective psyche. All these make this year one that many Nigerians may not forget in a hurry. Nevertheless, Christmas proclaims, \u2018Joy to the world the Lord has come.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor every disenchanted Nigerian who is on the verge of giving up on this country; for anyone who is prepared to cut off his moorings and drifts away to distant lands, Christmas challenges us to dare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that unbridled corruption and criminality were a grim reminder that selfishness had taken root in the hearts of many statesmen, the Archbishop said: \u201cChristmas is an invitation to give up selfishness, to think only of others and how to bring the greatest happiness to them.\n\n\u201cOn account of Christmas, all our leaders are challenged to once again dream big for our country and to faithfully work hard to realise those dreams so as to find solutions to our teething problems and better the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishops Urge Nigerians to Be Hopeful\n\nCatholic Bishops have urged Nigerians overwhelmed by suffering and hardship not to give up hope of a better Nigeria.\n\nThe bishops said Nigerians should always remember the popular Christmas refrain, Emmanuel which is that \u201cGod is with us\u201d and try to be hopeful of a better future.\n\nIn its Christmas message issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) jointly signed by the President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze; Vice President, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji and Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh, the clergymen enjoined Nigerians not to allow any situation to lead them to despair because God is always there to intervene for them.\n\n\u201cThis feast reminds us that God is with us. Therefore, the word \u2018Emmanuel\u2019 should be a constant refrain in our mouths. We should, therefore, not allow any situation to lead us to despair because God is always with us. We are grateful to God for all his divine interventions in our lives. We know that if not for God, things would have been worse.\n\n\u201cI want us to use part of our time during this holy season and maybe even beyond the Christmas Season to develop our capacity to listen to God who speaks to us in silence,\u201d said the bishops.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ganduje demands deployment of more soldiers in Kano\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has described the multiple rocket attacks in Maiduguri by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) ahead of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno State last Thursday as worrisome.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThis is just as the federal government allayed the fears of Nigerians over the reported planned attack by terrorists on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nISWAP had launched multiple rockets on Maiduguri, the state capital, hours before the visit of the President to Borno State.\n\nFive people were killed and many houses destroyed by the ISWAP rockets that landed in different areas, including Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari, and Ayafe communities.\n\nThe IG, however, said the insurgents were unable to achieve their objectives.\n\n\u201cThey are launching it in major towns, they are launching it in Maiduguri. It is a concern. And it has been seriously checkmated. There are efforts to continuously checkmate it,\u201d Baba said.\n\nHe stressed that although the government and the security forces were particularly concerned about the rocket attacks, the target of the terrorists was defeated by security forces.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari, during the meeting, tasked all security and intelligence chiefs in attendance to increase the heat against the terrorists and all other criminals, saying none should be spared.\n\nThe IG said they were asked to spare no terrorist or criminal, adding that the target now should be crime prevention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe marching orders are always the same; you have even told Nigerians the marching orders of the President. It has always been the same; there is no space, there is no tolerance to any threat to security.\n\n\u201cThere is no sparing of any terrorist and there must be an intelligence gathering, there must be proactive prevention of crime and there must be checkmating of all those that are involved in criminal activities, whether it is terrorism, banditry or armed robbery or whatever and that is what we are trying to do to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u201d\n\nOn why there are so many policemen deployed to the South-east region of the country, seemingly more than to areas considered more prone to violent crimes, Usman said population, economic activities and other factors determine deployment.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou said it is an allegation which has not been proven, it has always been an allegation. The spaces are different, the whole of the South-east, in terms of landmass, might not be as large as Niger State, so certainly you may see a number of policemen within a very small space, trying to do policing work and you may see another number, not equal, doing much more than that.\n\n\u201cBut when we talk about policing a population or policing a place where there is economic activity or policing in a place where there are more threats, then certainly you have to put more men to govern that small space and that is what you are seeing.\n\nAlso speaking to newsmen, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allayed fears among Nigerians, especially the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over reported planned attack on Abuja, saying there is no cause for worry.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any threat to the safety and security of Abuja. Abuja is secure and very safe. If there was a leak, as you mentioned, it could just be an operational alert that does not require any worry or concern. The Council has mandated us to assure Nigerians of their safety, of their security and enduring peace for the period of the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe message of the Security Council, through you to Nigerians, is that all measures for the safety and security of the Nigerian people and Nigeria, are in place for a successful and happy celebration of the yuletide and the New Year. Compliment of the season to all of us from the President and members of the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the security meeting, the President swore-in the newly-appointed Minister of State for Works and Housing, Muazu Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the security meeting yesterday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.).\n\nOthers include Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.); Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo; and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nAlso present were the Inspector-General; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nGanduje Demands Deployment of more Soldiers\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more military personnel to forests in the state.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday after meeting with the president in Abuja, Ganduje said he came to brief Buhari on the security situation in his state.\n\nHe called for the establishment of another military training base in the forest bordering Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Plateau, as part of efforts to check the activities of criminals.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hand of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation is worsening now. Our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists, armed robbers and criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, we have taken some measures. We have two large forests, including the Falgore forest, which borders Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the army and there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest, using the facilities that we have provided.\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr. President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\u201d\n\nHe added that the state introduced the use of technology within its forests to improve effective communication between security operatives in the state.\n\nAccording to Ganduje, the state has also constituted an enlarged security committee to promote efforts to maintain peace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have introduced technology within the forest. From the office of the DSS in Kano and the office of the commissioner of police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest \u2014 the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres of optic fibre within the Kano metropolis, so that CCTV cameras will be more effective and we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of network improvement.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged security committee because limiting it to the air force, army, police, DSS, civil defence, I think the security network, in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we were able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Says with new hardware, military more prepared to flush out terrorists\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said his administration would support families of dead and wounded soldiers, and help them realise their potential. Buhari stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when he addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nIn a related development, the president stated that with the acquisition of more capability in military technology and hardware, the country was better prepared to deal with terrorists, especially in the North-east. Buhari gave the assurance on yesterday in Maiduguri after inaugurating some projects donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nBuhari, who addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base, said the military had almost eliminated completely insurgency and other security issues threatening the country. He urged men of Operation Hadin Kai, the military operation against insurgency in the North-east, to remain steadfast as they went into the final phase of the campaign against terrorism and other criminalities.\n\nHe urged them to stay focused \u201cto achieve our strategic end-state, which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North-east geo-political zone and other parts of the country, where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment.\u201d\n\nThe president told the soldiers that the whole country remained grateful to them for their gallantry in ensuring the gradual return of peace to the North-east. He condoled with families that had lost loved ones, as well as the wounded.\n\nBuhari assured the families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the country, and the injured that the federal government would cater for their needs, in recognition of their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nHe asserted before the troops, \u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country. Your career is like no other, because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others. I am, therefore, here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu, and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021. I do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and, indeed, the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the troops for their extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces are known for. Well done. Our country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterised by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people, who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes. Further to the reorganisations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the threat posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the president said substantial resources had been directed to procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal. He said similar attention was being given to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari told the troops that at the onset of his administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force. This was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimise the mutual gains for our respective national security,\u201d Buhari told the troops.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North-east region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region. I am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHe assured the people that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders, including friendly nations and civil society organisations, to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nWhile appreciating the government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the federal government in multiple spheres, the president added, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the federal government and states.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence staff, service chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation, which continues to enhance operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the research and development exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s annual conference and the launch of locally constructed seaward defence ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander-in-Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices, which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible.\u201d\n\nBuhari also said the manpower challenges, which had limited the rotation of some units from the theatre, would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.\n\nIn a related development, Buhari assured that hard times awaited terrorists troubling the North-west, with the procurement of high-tech equipment and hardware by the military.\n\nHe also said he would continue to do his best for the development of the country until May 2023, when he would statutorily leave the presidency.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday in Maiduguri after the inauguration of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre, and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi, he expressed concern at the level of insecurity in the North West zone.\n\nHe said it was sad that the people of the North-west, who prior to now lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time, would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nBuhari said, \u201c I know I swore by the constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country, and we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North-east but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar, which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state for the work he had done in two years, and said he was in the state in June to commission development projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum appreciated the president for honouring the state, adding that Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c the governor said.\n\nZulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nSpeaking also, Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The fourth wave of the Coronavirus pandemic has hit Nigeria\u2019s Presidential Villa as many aides of President Muhammadu Buhari and top officials of government have reportedly contracted the virus.\n\nAccording to Premium Times, the Nigerian Government is keeping a sealed lip on the matter, even as several journalists and media houses have been advised against reporting the surge in infections at the villa.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nIt was gathered that apart from the Permanent Secretary in the State House, Tijani Umar; the President\u2019s Aide-de-camp, Yusuf Dodo; his Chief Security Officer, Aliyu Musa, and his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, whose results were confirmed positive during the week, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, was also down with the virus.\n\nSome of the infected officials including Shehu, sources disclosed, were taken out of the cabinet meeting on Wednesday when the result of their polymerase chain reaction tests came back positive.\n\nGarba, who confirmed that he was \u201cafflicted by the mild variant of the COVID-19,\u201d in a text message shared on Saturday, said he had \u201cno confirmation\u201d of other cases mentioned to him.\n\nHe added that he was already fit, claiming he just completed his physical exercises when called but that it would require scientific evidence to claim that he no longer had the virus.\n\nHis message reads in part; \u201cI have no confirmation of the cases you mentioned, but yes I have been afflicted by the mild variant of the COVID-19. I felt okay from the beginning, maybe because one had received all three jabs, and right now, I feel 100 per cent. I just finished my hour-long running exercise.\n\n\u201cBut the strange thing about this ailment is that it is the scientists, not you, that will say you are okay. Right now, I\u2019m taking my prescriptions and isolating, and would go back for a test to ascertain if the virus is still here or it has left me. Thanks for your goodwill.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Garba\u2019s colleague and Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, on the matter, were unsuccessful as his phone indicated \u201cbusy\u201d when called many times, and he also did not reply to a message sent to him.\n\nOn his part, the Special Assistant to the President on Digital and New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi, said he could not comment on the matter.\n\nEfforts to reach the information minister, Mr Mohammed, also yielded no positive result as his phone line was not available for more than 24 hours while his aide, Segun Adeyemi, neither picked his calls nor replied to a message sent to him.\n\nHowever, reliable sources confirmed that Mohammed and other affected officials are currently in isolation and are receiving medical attention.\n\nIt was understood that due to the high number of officials affected by the pandemic, governance may have been affected at the centre.\n\nSources, who do not want to be quoted for fear of sanctions, said that the decision to shut down the office of the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, earlier in the week, was not unconnected to the huge number of officials at the State House that were already confirmed positive for the virus.\n\nThe special Adviser on Media to Mrs Buhari, Aliyu Abdullahi, said though the situation was not part of the reason advanced for the early closure in the statement issued, it could also not \u201cbe unconnected to it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, declined to either confirm or deny the matter, saying the President\u2019s wife may have taken the decision to avoid the spread of the virus.\n\nAsked if the virus scare was part of the reasons for the early closure of the President\u2019s wife\u2019s office, Mr Abdullahi, after much hesitation, said; \u201cWell, I think that is part of the reasons, though it wasn\u2019t stated in the release announcing the closure.

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",
          "summary": "On October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang.\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

In particular, Honeywell Flour Mills plc with an asset base of N68 billion, an annual revenue of about N55 billion and over 5,000 employees and several distributors was subject to unfair and harsh restrictions as a result of Ogunba\u2019s mischievous suits and wrongly obtained orders until the said orders were rightfully set aside by the Court of Appeal.\u201d\n\nConcluding, Honeywell said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act (CAP L11, LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nHadiza Mustapha, chief registrar of the Supreme Court and secretary of the Privileges Committee issued a statement informing the public that the committee had at an emergency on September 15, 2017, noted that the matter of the alleged misconduct levelled against Ogunba was tabled and decided.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthis is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at which the respondent (Ogunba) was given fair hearing, it was decided that the petition is meritorious. \u201cConsequently, the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at its 129th plenary meeting have withdrawn the rank of senior advocate of Nigeria from Kunle Ogunba Esq and all other privileges attached to the rank forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe story has been updated. https://businessday.ng/companies/article/lawyer-in-ecobanks-tango-with-honeywell-ogunba-got-back-rank-of-san-in-2018/",

          "text": "Nobel Peace prize laureate and South Africa\u2019s anti apartheid hero, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has died aged 90.\n\nTutu\u2019s death comes just weeks after that of South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president, FW de Clerk, who died at the age of 85.\n\nReacting to his death, President Cyril Ramaphosa said it marked \u201canother chapter of bereavement in our nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said Tutu was \u201can iconic spiritual leader, anti-apartheid activist and global human rights campaigner\u201d.\n\nHe described him as \u201ca patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead.\n\n\u201cA man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Tutu had helped bequeath \u201ca liberated South Africa,\u201d he added.\n\nTutu was one of the country\u2019s best known figures at home and abroad; a contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, he was was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation was among those paying tributes, saying Tutu\u2019s \u201ccontributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies.\n\n\u201cHe was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.\u201d\n\nIt is impossible to imagine South Africa\u2019s long and tortuous journey to freedom \u2013 and beyond \u2013 without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis, BBC reported.\n\nWhen democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa\u2019s former liberation movement, the ANC.\n\nMany South Africans today will remember Tutu\u2019s personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nKnown affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile.\n\nHe was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010.\n\nDespite his popularity though he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa \u2013 even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama.\n\nIn response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to \u201cgo home and shut up\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is not a vice-Jesus Christ,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political.\n\nAfter Mandela became South Africa\u2019s first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era.\n\nHe was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.",
          "summary": "Nobel Peace prize laureate and South Africa\u2019s anti apartheid hero, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has died aged 90.\nTutu\u2019s death comes just weeks after that of South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president, FW de Clerk, who died at the age of 85.\nA shepherd.\u201dIt is impossible to imagine South Africa\u2019s long and tortuous journey to freedom \u2013 and beyond \u2013 without Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\nLater he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa\u2019s former liberation movement, the ANC.\nHe became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year.",

          "text": "Concerned groups, including environmental rights groups and ethnic youth leaders, have welcomed the findings of the joint investigation visit which attributed the recent oil spill in Nembe to human sabotage.\n\nThe groups, which include Friends of the Environment, Nigerian Ethnic Youth Leaders Council (NEYLC), Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDYM), and the African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) made their positions known in their separate reactions to the findings.\n\nThey described the report that human sabotage caused the spill as truth based on science and facts that must be applauded by all stakeholders.\n\nThey agreed that the findings should be used to get the culprits and avert future occurrences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe groups, in applauding AITEO which has been vindicated by the findings, said they entertained no fear from the beginning that being a socially responsible oil company, the spill could not have been caused by AITEO\u2019s negligence.\n\nThey said the report which absolved the company of any fault or wrongdoing has further confirmed the saying that if lies travel for 20 years, the truth will catch up with it in one day.\n\n\u201cThis is a vindication for AITEO. Findings have shown that the spill, as we have been suspecting from the beginning, was an act of sabotage by enemies of the Federal Government and a plot to undermine President Buhari\u2019s Niger Delta agenda,\u201d the NEYLC, which is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths said in a statement signed by the Acting Head of the coalition\u2019s secretariat, Nduka Edede Chinomso.\n\nThe Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDYM) regretted that while experts in the industry, with their science-based evidence, believe the spill was sabotage, the Bayelsa State Government\u2019s agents were using emotion to look for scapegoats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat the findings have shown us that the Bayelsa State Government had since been playing on the emotion of the people of the area and indeed all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWith this evidence and science-based findings, we hope that the state government will be humble enough to make a public apology based on the wrong position it earlier took on the matter,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThe popular environmental rights group, Friends of the Environment, in its separate statement, said the issue of the six persons who were arrested at the scene at about 2.30 am when the spill happened should not be overlooked by the state government.\n\nIt said in a statement, \u201cSix persons were said to have been arrested at the scene at an ungodly hour of about 2.30 am.\n\n\u201cThis revelation is very key and should not be overlooked by the state government and all others concerned.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Youth Movement (ACYM), in a separate statement, said the findings have left no one in doubt concerning the cause of the spill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEven the man from Ministry of Environment who said he had reservations was convinced when an expert addressed his fears,\u201d ACYM said in a statement.\n\nThe African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), in a statement by its coordinator, Nduka-Edede Chinomso, also said the findings have been proven to be the handiwork of saboteurs and enemies of President Buhari\u2019 efforts to drive revenue while preserving the environment\n\nIt said, \u201cevidence from the joint investigation panel confirms earlier information that the spill was an act of national sabotage by enemies of the Buhari regime to sabotage the Federal Government\u2019s revenue drive, destabilize the Niger Delta region and undermine the President\u2019s ongoing peacebuilding efforts in that region.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari gave the service chiefs a new marching order yesterday to smash the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), which has surpassed Boko Haram in the North East conflict, before he leaves office in 2023.\n\nBuhari gave the order during a Security Council meeting in Abuja 24 hours after the gang launched rockets near the Maiduguri airport just as the President landed in the city.\n\nSeveral people were killed by the rockets.\n\n\ufffcPolice Inspector General Alkali Baba Usman said some of the masterminds of the attack have been eliminated.\n\nAnd in his Christmas message yesterday, the President told Nigerians to invoke the \u201cindomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavoury situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\ufffcThe Nation gathered that Buhari, during the Security Council meeting, directed that no inch of Nigerian territory should be ceded to terrorists.\n\nBuhari wondered why ISWAP insurgents kept striking from the same corridor unchecked and told the Service Chiefs to be prepared to win the war against insurgency before he leaves office.\n\n\ufffcThe President\u2019s second term expires in May 2023.\n\nBuhari said he meant what he told the troops in Maiduguri on the need to rout Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgents.\n\n\ufffcA top source, who spoke in confidence with one of our correspondents, said the meeting was a \u201cfrank appraisal session.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one was happy with how the ISWAP insurgents struck on Thursday and took the shine off Mr. President\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cThe President could not understand the recurring assaults from the same corridor or axis,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cWe had a similar incident on December 4. And before the President\u2019s visit, a security /intelligence evaluation was done with a caveat that there should be a subsidiary operation to cordon off this axis.\n\n\u201cYet the insurgents fired rockets from the same axis and targeted the Maiduguri International Airport.\n\n\u201cAlthough the President did not betray emotions during his visit, he was certainly not happy with the situation of things.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the source said: \u201cThe President asked the Service Chiefs not to give terrorists, especially the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), a breathing space. He directed that no inch of Nigerian territory must be occupied by terrorists.\n\n\u201cHe warned against the reversal of the gains the military has made. He also sought a more proactive campaign to rout the insurgents, whether Boko Haram or ISWAP.\n\n\u201cHe said his administration is prepared to win the war against insurgency.\u201d\n\nThe Nation also gathered that top Army Generals were yesterday deployed in Borno State to \u201creview the situation and boost the war against the insurgents.\n\nAnother source added: \u201cMany Army Generals arrived in Borno State on Friday to review the situation and improve on the operational strategies.\u201d\n\nBuhari at Christmas: How we can end this unsavoury security situation.\n\nThe President in his Christmas message as Nigeria joins the rest of the world today to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ asked Nigerians to invoke the \u201cindomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavoury situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nSimilar goodwill messages came from Senate President Ahmed Lawan, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, state governors, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Dr.Ignatius Kaigama, who said the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with suffering arising from the situation in the country.\n\nBuhari said Nigeria is yet to overcome its security challenges \u201cdespite the remarkable successes generally recorded.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time.\n\n\u201cIt is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, while it would continue to \u201ccreate opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said this is the second Christmas running that the world \u201cwill not be able to celebrate as we used to in years past,\u201d on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to \u201cembrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe asked those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC).\n\nAPC: We\u2019re solidly committed to innovations to improve Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) said it remains solidly committed to \u201cconstitutionally permitted and practical innovations and processes that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s election eering processes and internal democracy.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Dr. John Akpanudoedehe, assured Nigerians of the Buhari administration\u2019s \u201ccapacity, intent and urgency to check and contain all criminalities so that Nigerians could go about their legitimate activities across the country safely.\u201d\n\nThe party urged Nigerians to \u201cuse the joyful season to give and show love to our fellow men, particularly the needy and vulnerable among us,\u201d while also urging \u201cprayers and support for our selfless security and other essential services massively deployed around the country to ensure safe travel and yuletide festivities.\u201d\n\nPDP to Nigerians: Let\u2019s reinforce our determination for national rebirth\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) advised Nigerians to use the Christmas to reinforce their determination for national rebirth.\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, also stressed the need for Nigerians to unite and show love to one another, in line with the party\u2019s mission to \u201crescue and rebuild the nation from misrule\u201d.\n\nThe party said it was \u201cdeeply worried that in the last six years, Nigerians have been forced to mark Christmas in gloom, pain, anguish and utter despondency following excruciating economic hardship and worsened insecurity.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThe PDP is saddened that while people celebrate in other parts of the world, many Nigerian families could not afford the basic items of celebration or even travel, as they did in the past, to meet and bond with their loved ones due to high costs, worsened insecurity and deplorable state of roads which are now death traps in our country.\n\nThe PDP however urged Nigerians not to allow the suffering they face today to dampen or destroy their inner personalities as happy people so as not to lose sight of the message of hope, salvation and brighter future which Christmas offers.\n\nNational Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, charged Nigerians to keep hope alive in spite of daunting circumstances.\n\nAyu, in a Christmas goodwill message, said although the occasion symbolises love, hope, sharing, celebration and thanksgiving, the gloomy economic situation has made such very difficult.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut I charge Nigerians not to lose hope. Keep hope alive. There is life beyond the APC gloom. The day will break after this long night. Do not let the sorry state of the nation dampen the Christmas spirit\u201d.\n\nAtiku Abubakar urges Nigerians to sow seeds of unity.",

Nigeria wants good leaders. This will be someone who is ready to sacrifice so many things for the country. There will be a lot that will surround who will become the next president of Nigeria. The person will not be too old or too young. The person will have a clean bill of health from scandals. Of course, the Igbo will find it difficult and tough. They will come up with propaganda in order to keep them in the race.\n\n\u201cIn the 2023 election, Nigeria will want to pick the best candidate. The Northern states will be divided; some will support the South while some people will support the North. Governors from the Southern states will not speak with one voice. The Governors will be divided on personal grounds.\n\n\u201cAPC and PDP will do everything possible to reach consensus so that it won\u2019t cause problems. The pattern of the Southerners will be very firm while that of the Easterners will be very weak. They will make moves but they won\u2019t achieve their expected desires. Of course, the two leading parties will make bold moves that will make the 3rd party re-strategizes their plans.\n\n\u2018\u2019I foresee that whoever wins the 2023 election will be given the mandate freely given by the electorate. The spirit of God says Buhari is ready to handover and will not interfere or dabble into the affairs of who becomes the next President.

          "text": "South African anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described as the country\u2019s moral compass, died on Sunday aged 90, sparking an outpouring of tributes for the outspoken Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nThe small-statured Tutu, who had largely faded from public life in recent years, was remembered for his easy humour and characteristic smile \u2014 and above all his tireless fight against injustices of all colours.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa honoured this fight in a tribute to Tutu, announcing the archbishop\u2019s death on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDesmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world.\u201d\n\nMourners gathered outside his former parish in Cape Town, St George\u2019s Cathedral, while others massed at his home, some holding flower bouquets, according to an AFP journalist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very very sad he died. He was such a good man,\u201d said retired accountant Diane Heard.\n\nThe South African cricket team wore black armbands in his honour of the first day of the first Test against India in South Africa.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said, \u201cTutu inspired a generation of African leaders who embraced his non-violent approaches in the liberation struggle\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: South African Court Says Zuma Can Appeal Return To Jail\n\n\u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019\n\nA tireless activist, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for combatting white minority rule in his country.\n\nFamously outspoken, even after the fall of the racist apartheid regime, Tutu never shied away from confronting South Africa\u2019s shortcomings or injustices.\n\nIt was Tutu who coined and popularised the term \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d to describe South Africa when Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Tutu slammed even the ruling African National Congress (ANC) \u2014 the vanguard of the fight against white-minority rule \u2014 for cronyism and nepotism after apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn the past, he has confronted homophobia in the Anglican Church, challenged Mandela over-generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticised the corruption that mushroomed under ex-president Jacob Zuma.\n\nOrdained at the age of 30 and appointed archbishop in 1986, he used his position to advocate for international sanctions against apartheid, and later to lobby for rights globally.\n\nTutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent repeated treatment.\n\nHis public appearances become increasingly scarce, and in one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid vaccine, waving but not offering comment.\n\nHe retired in 1996 to lead a harrowing journey into South Africa\u2019s brutal past, as head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nFor 30 months, the commission lifted the lid on the horrors of apartheid.\n\n\u2018Larger than Life\u2019\n\nTutu, with his instinctive humanity, broke down and sobbed at one of its first hearings.\n\n\u201cHe articulated the universal outrage at the ravages of apartheid and touchingly and profoundly demonstrated the depth of meaning of ubuntu, reconciliation and forgiveness,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu \u201can extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was larger than life, and for so many in South Africa and around the world his life has been a blessing,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nTutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on October 7, 1931, to a domestic worker and a school teacher.\n\nHe trained as a teacher before anger at the inferior education system set up for black children prompted him to become a priest.\n\nHe lived for a while in Britain, where, he recalled, he would needlessly ask for directions just to be called \u201cSir\u201d by a white policeman.\n\nTutu relentlessly challenged the status quo on issues like race, homosexuality and religious doctrine and gave his pioneering support for the assisted dying movement.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t shy away from his own end.\n\n\u201cI have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs,\u201d he said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post in 2016.\n\n\u201cI hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life\u2019s journey in the manner of my choice.\u201d\n\nTutu\u2019s death came just weeks after F.W de Klerk, South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president passed away on November 11.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "A Reuters witness said security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds on a tenth day of major demonstrations since an Oct. 25 coup. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said 178 people were injured during Saturday\u2019s protest, with eight caused by live bullets. Protesters opposed to military rule reached near the presidential palace in the Sudanese capital on Saturday for the second time in a week, television images showed, despite heavy tear gas and a communications blackout. In separate statements, the committee said security forces entered Khartoum Hospital and Port Sudan Hospital.\n\nA week ago, demonstrators begin a sit-in at the gates of the palace before being dispersed. But on Saturday they were met with by security forces and turned back. Internet services were disrupted in the capital, and residents were unable to make or receive phone calls, the witnesses said, while soldiers and Rapid Support Forces blocked roads leading to bridges linking Khartoum with Omdurman, its sister city across the Nile. Protests against the coup have continued even after Abdallah Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister last month. The demonstrators have demanded that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections. Service began to return for at least some users late on Saturday.\n\nSome people managed to post images on social media showing protests in several other cities, including Madani and Atbara. In Omdurman, security forces fired tear gas at protesters near a bridge connecting the city to central Khartoum, another Reuters witness said.\n\n\u201cChaos and abuses will be dealt with,\u201d it added. Protesters in Khartoum chanted: \u201cClose the street! Close the bridge! Burhan we will come straight to you,\u201d referring to military leader and sovereign council head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. \u201cDeparting from peacefulness, approaching and infringing on sovereign and strategic sites in central Khartoum is a violation of the laws,\u201d SUNA state news agency reported, citing a provincial security coordination committee. U.N. Special Representative to Sudan Volker Perthes urged Sudanese authorities not to stand in the way of Saturday\u2019s demonstrations.\n\nThe military could not immediately be reached for comment. Sources told Reuters they heard gunshots in the vicinity of the offices of UNAMID peacekeepers in Darfur on Saturday morning. \u201cFreedom of expression is a human right. This includes full access to the internet. According to international conventions, no one should be arrested for intent to protest peacefully,\u201d Perthes said. Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people marched to the presidential palace and security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters.\n\nForty-eight people have been killed in crack-downs on protests against the coup, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said.",

          "text": "Commercial airlines around the world canceled more than 5,900 flights over the Christmas weekend, as a mounting wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant created greater uncertainty and misery for holiday travelers.\n\nCommercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the canceled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.\n\nThe website showed that 1,779 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 402 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.\n\nAirline carriers globally scrapped at least 2,401 flights on Friday, which fell on Christmas Eve and is typically a heavy day for air travel, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Nearly 10,000 more flights were delayed.\n\nAmong the first U.S. carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of COVID-19 infections.\n\nCOVID-19 infections have surged in the United States in recent days due to the highly transmissible variant Omicron, which was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nOne in 20 Londoners had COVID-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nWhile recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalizations, than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook. \u201cThere is a glimmer of Christmas hope \u2026 but it definitely isn\u2019t yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat,\u201d Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC. Government data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000. France hit another COVID-19 infection record on Friday, with its daily tally exceeding 94,000 while hospitalizations from the virus reached a seven-month high, prompting the government to convene a special meeting for Monday that could trigger new public health restrictions.\n\nMoses Jimenez, an accountant from Long Beach, Mississippi, flew to New York with his wife and three children, even though the latest torrent of coronavirus cases dashed their hopes of catching a Broadway performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d or visit some museums. \u201cHamilton\u201d was one of a dozen productions to cancel shows this week as cast and crew members tested positive for COVID-19. Museums were scratched from the family\u2019s itinerary because many now require proof of vaccination and the two younger children are ineligible for the shot. Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season. Instead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city\u2019s streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas,\u201d Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport. New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases, capping the number of attendees 15,000. The Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said.\n\nThe average number of new U.S. coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nNew York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state\u2019s daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.",
